0,0,0,344.WasDNCWorkerSethConr,"Claim:DNC staffer Seth Rich was gunned down to prevent him from meeting with the FBI over plans to testify against Hillary Clinton.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 10 July 2016, Democratic National Committee (DNC) staffer Seth Conrad Rich was shot and killed just after 4 AM in Washington, D.C. Rich's tragic death was undoubtedly destined to feed a number of conspiracy theories due to his line of work and the proximity of the 2016 presidential election. Among those theories were myriad conflicting claims that Rich was covertly working to expose election fraud, collaborating with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on an unspecified investigation, or a recycled assertion that he was imminently to testify against Hillary Clinton when he was gunned down. (No ongoing court case we could locate would involve any such testimony from Rich.):On 13 July 2016, the notoriously unreliable conspiracy-flogging outlet WhatDoesItMean.com hoovered up the fresh tragedy as part of what appeared to be a series of articles capitalizing on recent deaths to drive conspiracies about Hillary Clinton. Describing the 27-year-old Rich as a ""top"" DNC ""official,"" the site blared that he was bumped off by a Clinton ""hit team"":Assassination Of Top US Democratic Party Official Leads To FBI Capture Of Clinton ""Hit Team""A somber Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that a top American Democratic Party staffer preparing to testify against Hillary Clinton was assassinated this past Sunday during a secret meeting in Washington D.C. he believed he was having with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents, but who turned out, instead, to be a ""hit team""--and who, in turn, were captured yesterday after a running gun battle with US federal police forces just blocks from the White House. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]This SVR report, though, says that DNC official Seth Rich was ""lured/enticed"" to his murder by this Clinton ""hit team"" who portrayed themselves as FBI agents wanting to secretly interview him--and that the expelled Russian diplomats had given the US State Department ""electronic access"" to so that they could be found.Curiously, this report continues, US authorities, and while being able to track this Clinton ""hit team"" since 7 July, only confronted these assassins yesterday--and who before being captured, engaged in a gun battle with US federal police forces firing their fully automatic weapons before being trapped and surrendering just blocks from the US Capitol and White House.:In short, WhatDoesItMean.com held that Rich was under the impression he was to meet with FBI agents (at the bizarre hour of 4:00 AM) but in actuality had been set up for a fatal encounter with hit men working on behalf of Hillary Clinton. The site correctly quoted a D.C. Metro police press release, as we contacted the department and confirmed that release contained all known information about Rich's death:Detectives from the Metropolitan Police Department's Homicide Branch are investigating a fatal shooting that occurred in the 2100 block of Flagler Place, Northwest on Sunday, July 10, 2016.At approximately 4:19 am, members of the Fifth District were patrolling the area when they heard gunshots. Upon arrival on the scene, members located an adult male victim conscious and breathing, and suffering from gunshot wounds. The victim was transported to an area hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead.The decedent has been identified as 27-year-old Seth Conrad Rich, of Northwest, DC.:Police reported that Rich was conscious and breathing at the time of the shooting. Had he any information about his murder having been a set-up, he likely would have conveyed such to attending officer before he died of his wounds shortly thereafter. Contemporaneous news reports suggested that Rich's murder was indeed perplexing, as elements of the incident were dissonant with the appearance of a robbery gone awry:""If it was a robbery -- it failed because he still has his watch, he still has his money -- he still has his credit cards, still had his phone so it was a wasted effort except we lost a life,"" said Joel Rich, Seth's father.Immediately after that portion, the article quoted the elder Rich regarding the moments prior to his son's death. According to Joel Rich, Seth was on the phone with his girlfriend when the shooting started, and Rich indicated to his girlfriend that he was nearly home and not headed out for an FBI meeting implausibly scheduled in the middle of the night on a Saturday::Rich said Seth was talking to his girlfriend on the phone outside when the incident happened.""Asked him if he was home yet and he said just about, and then she heard some noise, he said he had to call her back -- I don't know when that conversation ended but at 4:18 two shots were fired,"" said Rich.According to Washington, D.C. television station WUSA, a string of robberies had occurred in the area where Rich was killed, and police believe that spate of crime was likely connected with his death. The station also reported that the 27-year-old staffer worked in voter expansion, helping people ""find their polling places""; Rich's age and the relatively minor scope of his duties made him an unlikely linchpin in a conspiracy involving election fraud or any purported testimony against Hillary Clinton. The young staffer had only been employed with the DNC, where he was a Voter Expansion Data Director, since 2014, making his position and tenure an unlikely match-up with possession of crucial information for which he was supposedly killed.:Metropolitan Police Department spokesperson Alice Kim said ""there is no indication that Seth Rich's death is connected to his employment at the DNC.""Slate also noted that the conspiracy theory version of Rich's death was lacking in both evidence and sense, yet WikiLeaks has since fanned the flames of speculation by offering a $20,000 reward for information about Rich's killer:Julian Assange and his WikiLeaks organization appear to be actively encouraging a conspiracy theory that a Democratic National Committee staffer was murdered for nefarious political purposes, perhaps by Hillary Clinton.Seth Rich was killed in Washington, D.C., in an early morning shooting that police have speculated was a failed robbery. Because Rich did voter outreach for the DNC and because we live in a ridiculous world, conspiracy theorists have glommed on to a fantastical story that Rich was an FBI informant meeting with purported agents who were actually a hit team sent by Hillary Clinton. There is of course absolutely zero evidence for this.The fact that the idea is so absurd, though, has not stopped Assange from suggesting that Rich was murdered for nefarious political purposes either because he was an informant for the FBI or because he may have been a source in last month's WikiLeaks release of thousands of DNC emails.:Rich's hometown newspaper, the Omaha World-Herald, also observed the lack of any substance to such rumors:Fevered political conspiracy theories about the death of Seth Rich have been swirling through online comment sections and websites ever since the Omaha native was gunned down early on July 10 close to his home in northwest Washington, D.C.All indications from police have been that Rich's death was most likely the result of a botched robbery -- a sadly too-common case of a promising young man cut down simply by being in the wrong place at the wrong time.But that hasn't stopped wild Internet speculation from going viral, based in part on the fact that Rich worked at the Democratic National Committee. Internet commenters have suggested that Rich was behind the disclosure of DNC emails to WikiLeaks that helped force the resignation of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida as chairwoman. The conspiracy theorists got new ammunition when WikiLeaks announced a $20,000 reward for information leading to a conviction in Rich's death.Never mind the evidence in favor of a robbery, the fact that the leaked emails were released well after his death or even that WikiLeaks itself stressed that the reward should not be taken as an implication that Rich was involved in the email leak.:A spokesman for the Rich family said that people ""attempting to politicize this horrible tragedy"" are ""causing more harm than good"":[S]ome are attempting to politicize this horrible tragedy, and in their attempts to do so, are actually causing more harm than good and impeding on the ability for law enforcement to properly do their job. For the sake of finding Seth's killer, and for the sake of giving the family the space they need at this terrible time, they are asking for the public to refrain from pushing unproven and harmful theories about Seth's murder.Rich was the second deceased individual ""connected"" to Clinton by WhatDoesItMean.com and the third inaccurately reported as endangered by the candidate. The same outlet falsely claimed hacker Guccifer (Marcel Lazar Lehel) was missing and presumed dead after he purportedly hacked into Clinton's e-mail, and just prior to that the site claimed former UN official John Ashe had been murdered on the eve of his providing scheduled testimony against Clinton. Guccifer was confirmed alive and well by officials at the facility in which he was housed, and a federal prosecutor's office affirmed Ashe's legal troubles were in no way connected to Clinton.:A common thread between the three rumors was a blogger known by the nom de plume ""Sorcha Faal."" RationalWiki describes Faal's WhatDoesItMean.com conspiracy site as ""sensational"" and ""outrageous"":Sorcha Faal is the alleged author of an ongoing series of ""reports"" published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don't think much of it.Each report resembles a news story in its style but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don't contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish.While it's true police maintain an open investigation into Seth Rich's death, the claim connecting him to Hillary Clinton was the third of its sort to emerge from the same conspiracy-monger in mid-2016. All those rumors were variations on the long-circulating (and false) ""body bags"" claims that the Clintons habitually do away with once-loyal associates turned political liabilities. Prior to publishing the trio of Clinton-related fabrications, the same site and blogger held that President Obama had ordered the military to nuke the city of Charleston (which didn't happen), that Rear Admiral Rick Williams was fired because he revealed Obama's purchase of a mansion in Dubai (Williams was actually terminated for misconduct), and that Vladimir Putin and Barack Obama were enmeshed in a potentially conflict-starting dispute over the practices of the Monsanto agribusiness corporation.:"
1,1,1,414.AreDoctorsandHospita,"Claim:Medicare is paying hospitals $13,000 for patients admitted with COVID-19 diagnoses and $39,000 if those patients are placed on ventilators.Rating:MixtureAbout this rating What's TrueIt is plausible that Medicare is paying hospital fees for some COVID-19 cases in the range of the figures given by Dr. Scott Jensen, a Minnesota state senator, during a Fox News interview.What's FalseHowever, Medicare says it does not make standard, one-size-fits-all payments to hospitals for patients admitted with COVID-19 diagnoses and placed on ventilators. The $13,000 and $39,000 figures appear to be based on generic industry estimates for admitting and treating patients with similar conditions.:Snopes is still fighting an ""infodemic"" of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. In mid-April 2020, social media users shared a meme implying that hospitals had a financial incentive to inflate the number of COVID-19 patients they were admitting in the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.The meme contained red text that said, ""So, hospitals get an extra $13,000 if they diagnose a death as COVID-19 and an additional $39,000 if they use a ventilator!"" and prompted readers to ask Snopes.com to verify whether the statement is true::The idea that hospitals are getting paid $13,000 for patients with COVID-19 diagnoses and $39,000 more if those patients are placed on ventilators appears to have originated with an interview given on the Fox News prime-time program ""Ingraham Angle"" by Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician who also serves as a Republican state senator in Minnesota.During the April 9, 2020 interview, Jensen suggested to host Laura Ingraham that he believed the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. was being artificially inflated. ""The idea that we're going to allow people to massage and sort of game the numbers is a real issue because we're going to undermine the (public) trust,"" he said.Ingraham then played footage from a press conference with comments from Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in which Fauci called claims that the number of coronavirus cases are being ""padded"" a conspiracy theory. In an exchange that followed, Jensen suggested that Medicare, the national health care plan for the elderly, was paying hospitals set amounts for each patient diagnosed and treated for COVID-19:INGRAHAM: Dr. Fauci was asked about the COVID death count today. Here's what he said, in part.[Cut to briefing]REPORTER: What do you say to those folks who are making the claim without really any evidence that these deaths are being padded, that the number of COVID-19 deaths are being padded?FAUCI: You will always have conspiracy theories when you have very challenging public health crises. They are nothing but distractions.[Cut back to Ingraham]INGRAHAM: Conspiracy theories, doctor? So you're engaging in conspiracy theories. What do you say to Dr. Fauci tonight?JENSEN: Well I would remind him that any time health care intersects with dollars it gets awkward. Right now Medicare has determined that if you have a COVID-19 admission to the hospital, you'll get paid $13,000. If that COVID-19 patient goes on a ventilator, you get $39,000, three times as much. Nobody can tell me after 35 years in the world of medicine that sometimes those kinds of things impact on what we do.:We attempted to reach Jensen by phone and email, but did not get a response in time for publication.We also reached out to the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to ask whether the statement that Medicare was paying hospitals $13,000 and $39,000, respectively, for patients admitted with COVID-19 diagnoses and patients with the disease who are placed on ventilators.A spokesperson for CMS told us that whether hospitals are paid by Medicare for care of a COVID-19 patient would depend on whether that patient was covered by Medicare insurance. CMS also told us there is no set or predetermined amount paid to hospitals for diagnosing and treating COVID-19 patients, and the amounts would depend on a variety of factors driven by the needs of each patient. Pay-outs would also depend on the variance of the costs of medical care in different regions.The closest match for the numbers cited by Jensen we could locate was in an April 7, 2020, article published by the health care nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. As a starting point to estimate how much hospitals might get paid by the federal government for treating uninsured COVID-19 patients, the article used average payments for hospital admissions for similar conditions in 2017: :For less severe hospitalizations, we use the average Medicare payment for respiratory infections and inflammations with major comorbidities or complications in 2017, which was $13,297. For more severe hospitalizations, we use the average Medicare payment for a respiratory system diagnosis with ventilator support for greater than 96 hours, which was $40,218.But while these industry estimates are similar to the numbers Jensen cited, they do not represent actual Medicare payments to hospitals for COVID-19 diagnoses or treatment, or even a national average of such payments. We therefore rate this claim ""Mixture."" While it seems plausible that Medicare disbursements to hospitals treating COVID-19 patients could be in the range given by Jensen in the Fox News interview (if those patients are covered by Medicare), we found no evidence to support Jensen's assertion that ""Medicare has determined"" that hospitals will be paid $13,000 for patients with COVID-19 diagnoses or $39,000 for COVID-19 patients place on ventilators."
2,2,2,337.DidCentnerAcademyinF,"Claim:A private school in Miami, Florida, sent a conspiracy theory-fueled email to parents saying its policy was to not employ anyone who was vaccinated for COVID-19.Rating:TrueAbout this rating Snopes is still fighting an ""infodemic"" of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. :On April 26, 2021, a private school in Miami, Florida emailed a letter to parents that singled out vaccinated staff, including teachers, according to news reports. Centner Academy, which opened in 2019 and reportedly ""charges almost $30,000 a year per student,"" said in the email that one of its policies is to not employ anyone who has been vaccinated for COVID-19.This was a true story. In fact, the Centner Academy website recently published an anti-vaccine news article on its website with the headline: ""Medical Freedom from Mandated Vaccines."" The page contained false and misleading information about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.Jim DeFede, an investigative reporter with Miami's CBS4, tweeted a copy of the letter that was sent to parents. The tweet was later removed, purportedly in violation of Twitter's rules.The letter was sent by school co-founder Leila Centner and followed a separate email sent to faculty and staff. The beginning of the email pushed a false and debunked conspiracy theory that claimed vaccinated individuals are dangerous to people who are unvaccinated. The Florida school also said that it has a policy that it would not employ teachers or other staff if they had received a vaccine::It was an eventful week that also included an important meeting among our faculty and staff where we shared the difficult decision that moving forward, until further notice, we ask any employee who has not yet taken the experimental COVID-19 injection, to wait until the end of the school year. We also recommended that all faculty and staff hold off on taking the injection until there is further research available on whether this experimental drug is impacting unvaccinated individuals. It is our policy, to the extent possible, not to employ anyone who has taken the experimental COVID-19 injection until further information is known.The email was filled with false and debunked conspiracy theories. For example, it claimed that no ""solid research"" exists on the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines.To be clear, COVID-19 vaccines went through rigorous testing and clinical trials. They have been deemed safe and effective by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The World Health Organization also said that the vaccines are both safe and effective.In a CBS4 investigation, reporters said they were told that ""one teacher has already resigned but it's not clear if it was in direct result of this policy."":The New York Times also reported that both of the school's founders, including Leila Centner and her husband, David, ""donated heavily to the Republican Party and the Trump reelection campaign, while giving much smaller sums to local Democrats.""In February, the Centners welcomed a special guest to speak to students: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the prominent antivaccine activist. (Mr. Kennedy was suspended from Instagram a few days later for promoting Covid-19 vaccine misinformation.)This month, the school hosted a Zoom talk with Dr. Lawrence Palevsky, a New York pediatrician frequently cited by anti-vaccination activists.We reached out to Centner Academy for a statement on the matter. A spokesperson emailed back and told us: ""The health and safety of our students has, and remains, our #1 priority at Centner Academy, the first happiness school in the US which draws on the latest research in the fields of mindfulness, emotional intelligence and the science of happiness."":The rest of the lengthy statement was filled with false and debunked conspiracy theories similar to those that were in the letter sent to parents.In sum, it was true that an anti-vaccine school in Florida told parents that it had a policy to bar teachers and other staff from being employed if they had received a vaccine."
3,3,3,109.NoJoeBidensWalkingBo,"Claim:U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's walking boot conceals a GPS ankle bracelet that monitors people under arrest.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In late November 2020, U.S. President-elect Joe Biden suffered a hairline fracture in his right foot, which occurred after he tripped playing with his German shepherd, Major. The injury required him to wear an orthopedic boot to protect the bone while it heals.:Perhaps inevitably, the appearance of the boot on Biden's foot spawned conspiracy theories. Various social media accounts stated they believed the boot hid a GPS ankle monitor, because Biden, they said, was under arrest.But this is just an iteration of other baseless claims sourced from the Qanon conspiracy theory, which posits that high-profile legislators and various celebrities are part of a child trafficking cabal. Other famous people and politicians alleged to have worn ankle monitors have been former President Barack Obama, actor Tom Hanks, and talk show hosts Ellen DeGeneres and Oprah Winfrey.Here's an example of a social media post claiming Biden's boot, and similar medical devices worn by other political figures, is an ankle monitor. We cropped this Twitter user's name out for privacy::Biden's doctor has confirmed the foot fracture in a statement, saying that he will need to wear a walking boot for several weeks during recovery.No evidence exists that Biden's orthopedic boot is anything other than that, and claims otherwise are part of a baseless conspiracy theory."
4,4,4,168.ZeroEvidenceDrBenjam,"Claim:A ""Dr. Benjamin Eidelman"" gave Buffalo Bills defensive back Damar Hamlin a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot days before he collapsed during a game.Rating:UnfoundedAbout this rating A baseless conspiracy theory is making the rounds about a person supposedly named ""Dr. Benjamin Eidelman,"" Buffalo Bills defensive back Damar Hamlin, and COVID-19 vaccine booster shots.Related: Did CDC Confirm That Thousands 'Died Suddenly' As a Result of COVID Vaccines?:On Jan. 2, 2023, Hamlin collapsed on the field during Monday Night Football, which led to the postponement of the Bills' matchup with the Cincinnati Bengals. The game was being played in Cincinnati.According to The Associated Press, Hamlin's heart stopped and he was still in critical condition as of the next day. He was being cared for at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center.Here's where the conspiracy theory comes in: A tweet purportedly sent by a ""Dr. Benjamin Eidelman"" claimed that just days before, Hamlin had received a COVID-19 booster shot. A great deal of misinformation has gone around purporting to connect instances of athletes collapsing and even dying during sporting events to COVID vaccines.A screenshot of a purported tweet from someone named ""Dr. Benjamin Eidelman"" was shared online soon after Hamlin's collapse. The account associated with that tweet has since disappeared. It did not show signs of having been suspended, as accounts that Twitter suspends for terms of service violations usually display an ""account suspended"" message. Rather, the page on which the account previously resided showed the words, ""This account doesn't exist."" This appeared to mean the account was removed by the user.:The tweet in the screenshot read as follows: ""I recently administered Damar Hamlin's Covid booster on 12/26, and as a medical professional, I can assure the public he passed all screenings with flying colors. I am in contact with the UCMC staff and will provide any assistance to them."" We found that the screenshot was shared by @catturd2 on Twitter, the right-wing blog The Gateway Pundit, and at least two times on the r/conspiracy subreddit on Reddit. All these sources expressed skepticism about the veracity of the tweet. (Twitter):We, too, found multiple reasons to doubt its veracity.First, the tweet provided zero sources.Second, the official medical information for Hamlin's condition that was released by the Bills said nothing about COVID-19 or any vaccines at all.:Third, and perhaps most glaring, the @drbeneidelman Twitter account was brand new. According to an archived capture on the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, the account was created in December 2022. The first known activity showed up on Dec. 17. This meant that the account was only two weeks old by the time the tweet screenshot made the rounds.Fourth, we found only one person online with the name Dr. Benjamin Eidelman. He was listed as a neurologist in Jacksonville, Florida, and is a much older-looking gentleman than the person pictured in the Twitter profile picture for @drbeneidelman. The Florida doctor appeared to simply have the same name as the likely-bogus Twitter account.There are more reasons to doubt that the tweet was real, such as the existence of medical privacy laws limiting what information health care providers can share about their patients, and the fact that there is no evidence nor any logical reason to believe that Hamlin was ever a patient of a Dr. Benjamin Eidelman.At its most base level, we don't recommend blind trust in tweets supported by zero sources or evidence of any kind.:We will update this story if any further information becomes available."
5,5,5,144.PatienceCarterIsaVic,"Claim:Orlando shooting victim Patience Carter is actually a ""crisis actor.""Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 14 June 2016, a video accusing a young woman who was injured during the mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando of being a ""crisis actor"" was posted to YouTube:: As with other false flag rumors, the above video provides absolutely no proof that Patience Carter was paid to act as if she had been injured during the Orlando shooting. Instead, the narrator takes an unrelated fact --  that Carter is an intern at a local news outlet -- and then shouts at length about the Pulse nightclub shooting being fake:""There she is. On Fox F***ng news. On Fox F**** news. There she is. Once again, the F****ng bullsh*t they are shoving down people's throats. We need to arrest all these people. This has gone way to far. They have pulled this out too many times. There has to be change. There's no way they can use this event. This is faked. This is staged. They are using actors. There is no doubt about it. This is 100% bullsh*t. At no point does the narrator explain why being an intern at WTFX (a Fox News affiliate, which is not the same as working for the network itself) automatically makes Carter a paid crisis actor. While the video provided no evidence to back up its wildly dangerous, insensitive, and extremely insulting claims, supporters of the conspiracy theory started posting images of Carter in an attempt to prove that she was involved in a false flag event. :Facebook user Darius Williams, for instance, posted a photograph allegedly showing that Carter had posted to her Instagram on 3:13 am on 12 June 2016, after she had been shot::While the image on the left-hand side of this graphic was indeed taken from Carter's Instagram page, the time stamp was manipulated. In other words, the user ""proving"" that Carter was a ""crisis actor"" faked the ""evidence"" that he used. The actual posting on Instagram lists the date as 11 June 2016. Twitter provided an even more accurate time stamp:The photograph used to ""prove"" that Patience Carter was a crisis actor was actually taken hours before the shooting started.  While this conspiracy theory is based off of unrelated facts and blatantly manipulated images, it is true that Carter is an intern at WTFX:FOX 29 has a personal connection to the Orlando shooting.We are sending our thoughts and prayers to our own 20-year-old Patience Carter,who was in the Pulse nightclub when Omar Mateen started shooting.:Carter, a New York University student, was on vacation in Orlando when she was shot in the leg during one of the deadliest mass shootings on American soil in recent history. Her friend, Akyra Murray, was killed in the attack. On 14 June 2016, Carter shared a poem, saying that she felt guilty for being alive:""The guilt of feeling grateful to be alive is heavy. Wanting to smile about surviving but not sure if the people around you are ready, as the world mourns the victims killed and viciously slain, I feel guilty about screaming about my legs and pain... Because I could feel nothing.  "
6,6,6,145.VerifiedUnofficialFo,"UPDATE: Following our reporting, YouTube removed the majority of the unofficial ""Fox News"" YouTube channels.On Sept. 15, a TikTok user posted a video about something strange that he noticed while looking at his phone. An altered Fox News video thumbnail with disinformation about U.S. President Joe Biden appeared in his YouTube ""Home"" feed. Videos on the channel showed thumbnails that falsely claimed Biden was either dying or going to jail, and that former U.S. President Donald Trump was coming back. The message was similar to a debunked QAnon conspiracy theory that recently led to federal authorities worrying of potential violence from Trump supporters when such disinformation inevitably failed to come true.Other thumbnails on the YouTube videos showed lower-third headlines including ""Trump Come Back,"" ""The End! Joe Biden,"" ""Bye Biden & Harris,"" and ""Good Bye Joe Biden, RIP Biden."" The video thumbnails were altered by the YouTube account holders in order to push disinformation.:'Fox News Alert'The YouTube channel mentioned in the TikTok video was named ""Fox News Alert."" It had a verification badge and close to 800,000 subscribers. A verification page is supposed to be somewhat of a trust signal so that users know the content is dependable. However, this was not an official Fox News YouTube account. A Fox News spokesperson confirmed this to us as well. The channel also did not appear to be managed from inside the U.S. :The thumbnails on these YouTube videos were the same design as seen in our previous investigation about a foreign disinformation network we uncovered on Facebook. In the story, we documented how several Facebook pages, groups, and accounts had spread altered videos from Fox News, One American News Network (OAN), and Newsmax. The same false claim about Biden going away and Trump coming back was pushed in the Facebook video thumbnails. In total, the clips on Facebook were viewed at least tens of millions of times. We published the story more than a month ago. Even so, the disinformation network is still active and thriving, despite the fact that Facebook has tens of thousands of employees and content review workers on the clock worldwide.The verified ""Fox News Alert"" YouTube channel seen in the TikTok video showed the YouTube username ""OrigamiTiengViet."" ""TiengViet"" referred to the Vietnamese language. It also offered memberships on YouTube, which included the ability to use emojis of Pepe the Frog, a character that The Guardian reported as ""referring to the cartoon adopted by white supremacists as a mascot."" The channel's owner added the emojis of Pepe the Frog, as this is a YouTube option that can be customized.:On Oct. 1, the YouTube channel was still available and appeared to have 883,000 subscribers, a higher number than it did when the TikTok video was recorded in September. However, its YouTube verification badge has since disappeared. It has also changed its channel name and likely updated the visibility of the political videos to unlisted or private.Second ChannelA second channel also named ""Fox News Alert"" was also not an official product of Fox News Channel. It was verified and had 485,000 subscribers. Google Translate identified the language of some of its older videos as Bengali. The channel used to go under the name Pocket Cinema24. We found no publicly visible political videos on this channel. As with the first channel, the visibility of such videos were likely changed to unlisted or private. This verified ""Fox News Alert"" YouTube account had 485,000 subscribers and might appear to a viewer to be an official channel for the cable news company.: Despite the fact that the political videos were no longer publicly available, we found a way to quantify the number of views they likely racked up. On the ""About"" page for the first channel with the username ""OrigamiTiengViet,"" YouTube showed close to 95 million video views for its total count. We counted the number of views on every publicly available video. Our total came to 72 million views, leaving 23 million views unaccounted for. This meant that it was possible that the political disinformation videos on this one unofficial ""Fox News Alert"" channel were viewed 23 million times.The second channel had nearly 100 million total video views. Some 98 million of those views appeared to be for non-political content, leaving around 2 million views unaccounted for. Both channels appeared to have been verified based on previous non-political content. It's possible that the accounts were purchased after building a large subscriber count. However, there was no proof of this.Millions of Subscribers:A search for more channels named ""Fox News Alert"" ended with a surprising number of results. A third YouTube channel with a Vietnamese name just started posting the same Fox News videos and altered thumbnails a week ago. In that short span of time, by our count, its disinformation political videos had already been viewed more than 360,000 times.We also found several other channels that were doing the same thing. One verified, yet unofficial, ""Fox News Alert"" channel had nearly 1.5 million subscribers. It has since changed its name to ""Funday,"" likely to cover its tracks. However, it still links to videos in its ""Community"" tab on another verified, yet unofficial, YouTube channel simply named ""Fox News."" Despite the verification badge and Fox News logos, this is not an official Fox News YouTube channel.:It's possible that this data on the disinformation network might only be the tip of the iceberg. The channels we uncovered totaled at least millions of subscribers and what appeared to be tens of millions of video views.We reached out to YouTube with several questions. In our email, we asked why the ""OrigamiTiengViet"" channel is still available if it recently lost its verification badge. We also inquired about when the accounts were verified and requested a statement on the company's disinformation policies. The company responded by our deadline and indicated that they were investigating the matter and may send over answers shortly. We will update this story when we hear back.Sources""Foreign, Pro-Trump Facebook Pages Post Altered Fox News Videos, Earning Tens of Millions of Views.""

7,7,7,474.DidaSecondGunmanShoo,"Claim:A second gunman fired at a crowd from the fourth floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino during the mass shooting in Las Vegas.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In the days immediately following the worst mass shooting in modern American history, in which 58 people were killed and 527 injured by automatic gunfire while listening to music at an outdoor festival on the Las Vegas Strip on 1 October 2017, disreputable web sites like YourNewsWire and NaturalNews.com immediately leapt at the ensuing chaos to push false conspiracy theories.:Police say that the shooting was perpetrated by Stephen Paddock, a 64-year-old resident of Mesquite, Nevada, who opened fire with a modified weapon from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. According to their ongoing investigation, Paddock acted alone. These findings can be easily verified by listening to police radio traffic from the incident, in which officers say they hear gunfire coming from the 32nd floor of the hotel, identify Paddock's room, then burst in, only to find him deceased inside with a large number of firearms.However, that has not stopped web sites with a less than nodding acquaintance with journalistic integrity from latching on to the mass casualty incident while taking advantage of the chaos and confusion to push conspiracy theories and collect resulting ad revenue. For example, on 2 October 2017, YourNewsWire, a web site that regularly inserts itself into tragedies to push the anti-semitic New World Order conspiracy theory, reported:The mainstream media narrative about the Las Vegas shooting has been debunked by two explosive videos provided to Your News Wire that confirm there were multiple shooters involved in a co-ordinated attack.Both videos show gunfire originating from the fourth floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel, much lower than the 32nd floor, where the mainstream media is claiming Stephen Paddock, a ""lone wolf"", fired on the crowd using an automatic weapon.[...]The answers are simple. The corporate media, controlled by a small, elite oligarchy, is operating on behalf of the New World Order, attempting to mislead the public into believing their enemies are their friends, and their friends are their enemies.:The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD), which is the lead law enforcement agency handling the investigation of the shooting, found 23 weapons in the hotel room with Paddock after breaching the door. They have determined he modified a semiautomatic rifle to make it shoot continuous rounds like a fully automatic weapon, and then he fired into a concert crowd from his perch in a 32nd floor suite at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. During a 2 October 2017 press briefing, LVMPD Assistant Sheriff Todd Fasulo took time to refute rumors that there was more than one gunman:I want to emphasize we believe Paddock is solely responsible for this heinous act. We are aware of the rumors outside of the media and also on social media that there was more than one assailant. We have no information or evidence to support that theory, or that rumor. We believe there was only one shooter and that was Stephen Paddock. We are doing a thorough investigation and only want to provide what is accurate to you. We will only give information that we have vetted and know to be true.The ""evidence"" provided by YourNewsWire and on other conspiracy sites like ZeroHedge.com is a widely-shared, roughly 35-second blurry YouTube video in which the narrators claims to have captured muzzle flashes coming from a room on the fourth floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel. The video can be viewed here::Despite what the narrator says, the video in fact does not show muzzle flashes from a nonexistent shooter on the fourth floor of the hotel. The most obvious evidence supporting this is that none of the windows on the hotel's fourth floor were broken (photographs show that Paddock had knocked out two windows in his suite, from where he had a birds-eye view of the crowd below). Another video tracked down by social media users shows the same light flashing an hour before the shooting started -- it can be seen twinkling on the right side of the screen in the below video as country band Big and Rich are singing ""God Bless America"" earlier in the night:The second video posted by YourNewsWire as ""proof"" of a second shooter on the fourth floor appears to have been taken by a cab driver who was near the hotel during the incident -- but while gunfire can be heard in her video, no muzzle flashes are in fact visible.According to police, Paddock fired on the crowd of 22,000 people from room 32135, a large suite in the north of the building. (The Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino is shaped like a three-sided star, and Paddock's room was situated as far north in the building as possible, while the Route 91 Harvest Festival he attacked was just northeast of the building and across the north-south thoroughfare Las Vegas Boulevard.):In emergency radio traffic, which can be accessed through the scanner-capturing web site Broadcastify, it is clear that responding officers initially didn't know where the shots were coming from, and were getting reports from witnesses that there may have been more than one shooter. Eventually, however, they were able to pin down the location. One officer can be heard saying:I'm inside the Mandalay Bay on the 31st floor. I can hear the automatic fire coming from one floor ahead -- one floor above us.Another officer seems to debunk the idea that there were muzzle flashes coming from the fourth floor, when he can be heard saying that he's seeing a strobe light flashing on the east wing of the building:I haven't seen any flashes from Mandalay, but if it is coming from Mandalay there is a strobe light coming from one of those windows on the east side.There is no evidence to support the claim that there were multiple shooters or that those shooters' muzzle flashes could be seen from the fourth floor of the resort. As we noted, police believe through their investigation that Paddock acted alone during the shooting. The YouTube video presented as evidence for this claim appears to show a strobe light in one of the rooms, as evidenced by footage that seems to show the same light flashing well before the shooting, and the observation by a police officer at the scene who said it was a strobe light.:The fact that police received reports from traumatized witnesses of multiple shooters in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy is not surprising, nor does it offer conclusive proof that there was more than one assailant, said Bill Flores, a retired assistant sheriff with the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. He told us:Right at the beginning [of the shooting] people thought it was fireworks. Then when they realized something horrific was happening and they were in fear, their frame of mind changes and they think, 'Maybe we did hear a second shooter.' Law enforcement officers should follow up on every type of report that comes in.Furthermore, radio traffic from incident makes it clear police officers were climbing the stairs of the building floor by floor, and it defies logic to believe they would not have heard automatic gunfire coming from the fourth floor, when they clearly heard it coming from Paddock's room.On 5 October 2017 LVMPD officer Larry Hadfield confirmed to us that per the investigation, Paddock has been identified as the lone shooter::We investigated. There was one single shooter. That's officialPolice radio traffic from the incident can be heard here:"
8,8,8,23.ConspiracyTheoriesWh,"This article about COVID conspiracy theories is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.We've all seen them. Those posts shared by friends of friends on Facebook, that jaw-dropping tweet you can scarcely believe was not immediately deleted. Alongside social distancing and Zoom meetings, it seems that one inescapable symptom of the pandemic is the proliferation of conspiracy theories on social media.Conspiracy theories are distinct from other forms of misinformation and falsehood. They are particular ways in which we make sense of the complex and sometimes disturbing world around us. They have also long been seen as a particularly political phenomenon. The American historian Richard Hofstadter famously referred to such ideas as underpinning a ""paranoid style"" of political thinking, replete with ""heated exaggeration, suspiciousness, and conspiratorial fantasy"".:A more recent understanding of their importance can be found in the work of the political theorist Alfred Moore, who suggests they are means of ""explaining events or phenomena in a way that is unwarranted, implausible, or even dangerous, invoking ever and deeper conspiracies and discounting all contradictory evidence"".In my work, I argue that over recent years we have seen the emergence of distinct forms of conspiracy theory, driven by structural changes in the way we communicate about politics. In order to understand the phenomenon, we need to think of conspiracy theories as part of a significant shift in the ways political participation happens in contemporary democracies.Filling a voidThere are a number of reasons why we are seeing conspiracy theories take hold in this way, and these have implications for our response to the pandemic which cannot be ignored.:It is well established that conspiracy theories are more prevalent in times of crisis. Research shows us that the popularity of these ideas is not constant, and peaks during cataclysmic events and social upheaval. Conspiracy theories were prominent during previous pandemics, including the Black Death, the ""Russian flu"" of the late 19th century and the 1918 flu pandemic.However, in contrast to past crises, recent conspiracy theories have been driven by the rapid change in how we communicate with each other. Of particular importance is the emergence of social media sites, which enable the rapid spread of information based on (superficially, at least) plausible information produced by what appear to be reliable sources. This context matters, in part because it allows a great degree of individual agency in the dissemination of conspiracy theories. Fundamentally, conspiracy theories of this kind are powerful because they are participatory. They engage people directly in the development and amplification of political ideas, however outlandish they might seem. In an environment when trust and confidence in political institutions are declining and engagement in democracy is highly unequal, this form of participation provides an easily-accessible and engaging alternative to mainstream forms of political participation. :There is an adage amongst online conspiracy theorists - do your own research. This encourages those involved to seek out validation of their ideas from sources which refute the ""official"" narrative. Engaging in contemporary conspiracy theories therefore has a game-like quality. People are encouraged to ""discover"" information promoted through their online networks rather than passively accept data and facts produced by established sources. Research tells us that any evidence presented to the contrary, no matter how compelling, is unlikely to be accepted, and indeed, might even be taken as evidence in favour of the conspiracy theory. More importantly, following these beliefs necessarily means adopting a distrustful orientation towards public institutions and scientific evidence.Facing factsThere is clear potential for conspiracy theories of this kind to undermine efforts to stop the spread of COVID and damage trust in vaccines. False arguments against vaccines are presented as an ""alternative narrative"" of equal status to scientific evidence. Attempts to expose the frailties of such a position are held to be evidence of vested interests on the part of state agencies and pharmaceutical companies. :Throughout, the participatory, gamified nature of the generation and spread of these ideas allows people to find a degree of stability in a confusing and unsettling time. Surely, part of the appeal that there is a ""plandemic"" is that there is, actually, a plan governing our lives rather than uncertainty at every turn. The dangers of such conspiracy theories for public health and our ability to navigate a path away from the current pandemic are real. In such an environment, it can be hard to know fact from fiction, with expertise and established sources of information refuted and rejected through social media. That we have not seen a coherent and credible response to this issue is therefore deeply worrying.:Numerous steps might be taken to address the problem. Rethinking the regulation of social media and removing the most prolific ""super-spreader"" social media accounts (including those of celebrities and public figures) has obvious potential. A senior figure in government might also be appointed to lead on addressing misinformation. However, any intervention  needs to be rooted in an understanding of the shifting context of political participation. Of course, there are difficult questions over how we ensure that we address these forms of conspiracy theory in a way that doesn't restrict the legitimate questioning of authority that is essential in any democracy. But it is imperative that as a society we recognise, and respond to, the sudden growth in conspiracy theories of this kind.:Rod Dacombe, Director of the Centre for British Politics and Government, King's College LondonThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

9,9,9,364.DidJohnMcAfeeHideFil,"Claim:John McAfee tweeted that he hid 31TB of files at the building near Miami, Florida, that collapsed in June 2021. Rating:FalseAbout this rating On June 23, 2021, software pioneer John McAfee was found dead in his prison cell, hours after a Spanish court approved his extradition to the United States to face various charges of tax evasion. After news broke, a number of conspiracy theories started to circulate online. Some claimed, for instance, that McAfee's ""$WHACKD"" tattoo indicated that the software pioneer did not take his own life. (You can read more about the tattoo here.) Some social media users also attempted to use McAfee's death to turn a tragic incident -- the collapse of a condo near Miami Beach, Florida, that has left at least four people dead and more than a hundred more missing -- into a conspiracy theory.:On Twitter, an image supposedly showing a message McAfee posted on June 8, 2021, was circulated with claims that Champlain Towers had been intentionally demolished to destroy files McAfee had hidden there. This claim was also attached to another message that claimed McAfee's alleged son, Pat McAfee, had an office at this building. :There is no evidence to support these claims.The above-displayed tweet does not appear on McAfee's timeline and appears to have been doctored. And while McAfee previously claimed that he had fathered 47 children, there are very few details to back up this assertion. Regardless, there doesn't appear to be any record of John McAfee having a son named ""Pat McAfee."" The person of this name who may be most familiar to American audiences, sports analyst Pat McAfee, is not McAfee's son and has already confirmed on Twitter that he does not have a condo in Florida.We were unable to find any record of the above-displayed alleged tweet, which reads ""If anything ever happens to me, please know that 31TB of files I have are located on hard drives in my condo near 88th Street and Collins Avenue Just north of Miami Beach,"" on McAfee's Twitter timeline. We were also unable to find any retweets or quote tweets of this message directing back to a deleted link.It's also highly unlikely that this message was posted and subsequently deleted from McAfee's account. Not only is there no trace of the original URL, but after McAfee's death, social media users archived hundreds of tweets that had been posted by McAfee, presumably because they thought the account could be deleted. We looked over those tweets on Archive.is and found no record of a message from McAfee saying that he hid files in the building that collapsed in Florida. :It should also be noted that there's no reason at present to suggest that the building in Surfside, Florida was intentionally ""demolished."" While an exact cause has not yet been determined, officials noted that there was no evidence of foul play.The Miami Herald reported on one possible cause for the building's collapse:Greg Batista, a professional engineer from Davie who specializes in concrete repair projects, said that after watching the Surfside condo tower collapsing to rubble in online videos, one potential structural flaw jumped out at him.""Concrete spalling."" Here's what it means.Batista said that when salt water seeps into porous concrete, it causes the reinforced steel rods known as rebar in the support beams to rust and expand. In turn, the expansion breaks up the concrete and that weakens the beams.As of this writing, the only connection between McAfee's death and the building collapse in Florida is that they both took place in June 2021. McAfee did not tweet that he was storing files in the building, and the claim that his alleged son ""Pat McAffee"" owned a condo in the building appears to have been conjured out of thin air.:"

11,11,11,586.ShaunKingRacialContr,"On Aug. 19, 2015, the website Breitbart published an article titled ""Did Black Lives Matter Organizer Shaun King Mislead Oprah Winfrey by Pretending to Be Biracial?"" That article (which began by introducing inevitable comparisons to controversial NAACP chapter leader Rachel Dolezal) began:An investigative blogger has accused Shaun King, a key figure in the Black Lives Matter movement, of misleading media icon Oprah Winfrey by pretending to be biracial in order to qualify for an ""Oprah scholarship"" to historically black Morehouse College. The blogger says King is white and has been lying about his ethnicity for years.As Breitbart stated, the claims were sourced from a virtually unknown website (Re-NewsIt!) and material by a blogger purportedly named ""Vicki Pate."" (Pate's work, aside from King's racial background, has included releasing autopsy photos of Georgia teen Kendrick Johnson, whose body was found in a rolled up wrestling mat in the gymnasium of Lowndes High School, and advocating for George Zimmerman, who fatally shot Trayvon Martin.)In her original post, Pate predicted King would ignore her assertions::I am anxious to see how King will try to spin this, if he addresses it at all. I tried to get in touch with his father for a comment before posting this blog. He was out and a neighbor said he usually takes off with his riding mower and she doesn't see him for a few days.Unlike Dolezal, King immediately acknowledged and addressed the controversy in an Aug. 19, 2015 series of tweets, but those tweets primarily dealt with ancillary matters (such as whether he was really the victim of a racially-motivated mob beating, whether he was seriously injured in an automobile accident, and the motivations of his accusers) and did not directly refute the claims about his racial identity (all or most of these tweets have been deleted):Actually, I'm going to keep doing what I've been doing and attack police brutality with every fiber in me. Hell, I'm doubling down now.It's going to me a second, but let me show you, on my terms, in my way, that what is happening today is a white supremacist conspiracy.:1. On August 28th, I'm launching @JusticeTogether to fight for the end of police brutality in America. That's NINE DAYS away. Follow me...2. Two days ago, @GlennBeck & @TheBlaze released this hit piece on me. [link] All lies. Every bit of it.3. In March of 1995, I was brutally assaulted by a racist mob of rednecks at my school. Guess what, they denied it.4. Seeing that @GlennBeck was willing to produce lies about me, a student who witnessed the who thing wrote this [link]5. It's also important that you see this ---> [link] Because other people who REALLY saw it commented on it there.6. Smelling blood in the water, @dailycaller and @TuckerCarlson wrote this piece about me. All lies. [link]7. So, when this was written ---> [link] showing the truth of what happened, I thought it was all over. It was to me.:8. Notice, even though a credible, reliable unbiased eyewitness AND TEACHER refuted @glennbeck they don't retract [link]9. Now, here is where it gets full-fledged white supremacist conspiracy theory crazy. It's wild.9. Breitbart (I'd actually never heard of them before) after seeing what @glennbeck & @dailycaller & @TuckerCarlson wrote, wanted in on it.10. But, having no journalistic standards at all, Breitbart decided to use a known white supremacist as their main source of info on ME.11. You need to know this name. VICKI PATE You won't find her on Twitter. PERMANENTLY BANNED for racist harassment [image missing]12. Here is Vicki Pate's website where, for a living, she harasses the families of black folk killed by police. [link]13. So, this woman literally stalks my children. Speaks of them by first name on her blog, studies their medical history, etc.:15. First, Breitbart has 3 main sources. Vicki Pate (a known white supremacist) and @TheBlaze & @TheDailyCaller (who we already refuted).16. Breitbart claims I was never in a car accident. That's me. That's the car. The story: [link]King's rebuttal continued on Twitter. The evidence proffered by those asserting his claims to mixed-race heritage included: A family photograph reportedly posted to Facebook by Shaun King's brother showing a child said to be Shaun looking like a white toddler with curly red hair::An image presented as a copy of a police report involving a 15-year-old Shaun King that listed his race as ""white"":Reports from Re-NewsIt! and Breitbart maintained that Shaun King's birth certificate ""names a white man as his father,"" although the posted Certified Record of Birth simply lists the names of King's parents and not their races. Those sources used the Certified Record of Birth to find King's father's name (Jeffery Wayne King), then sought other records referencing that name to identify King's father's race::The Daily Beast similarly reported that public records identified the race of Shaun father's race as white::Prominent Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King said for years that he is biracial, because he was born to a white mother and a black father, but Kentucky public records reviewed by The Daily Beast show that King's father is white. Jeffery Wayne King, born Nov. 11, 1955, is listed as Shaun King's father on his birth certificate. Criminal records identify Jeffrey King's ethnicity as white.An image stated to be a mug shot from the arrest of Jeffery Wayne King showed a man who appeared to be white (but not definitively)::However, Back on 30 July 2015 (before both Pate and Breitbart accused him of fabricating his racial identity), King posted a high school photograph of himself from 1995 in which many viewers concurred he looked like a bi-racial youth:  Throwback. 1995. Sophomore in high school. Karl Kani shirt. Gold chain. Part. [image missing] -- Shaun King (@ShaunKing) July 30, 2015On 20 August 2015, Shaun King released a statement in which he suggested that the man listed on his birth certificate as his father was not in fact his biological father; rather, his father was a light-skinned black man with whom his mother had an affair:I refuse to speak in detail about the nature of my mother's past, or her sexual partners, and I am gravely embarrassed to even be saying this now, but I have been told for most of my life that the white man on my birth certificate is not my biological father and that my actual biological father is a light-skinned black man. My mother and I have discussed her affair. She was a young woman in a bad relationship and I have no judgment. This has been my lived reality for nearly 30 of my 35 years on earth. All of my siblings and I have different parents. I'm actually not even sure how many siblings I have. It is horrifying to me that my most personal information, for the most nefarious reasons, has been forced out into the open and that my private past and pain have been used as jokes and fodder to discredit me and the greater movement for justice in America. I resent that lies have been reported as truth and that the obviously racist intentions of these attacks have been consistently downplayed at my expense and that of my family.:We spoke to King directly about background information which emerged in the intervening weeks and months after the August 2015 Breitbart-initiated controversy. King stated that at the time our article was initially published, he was overwhelmed by an avalanche of media inquiries and maintained that while many in the public sphere knew him only as a Black Lives Matter activist, his interpersonal connections were older and more through (making the claims plausible to folks who only recently came to know King through news of his activism):""I have been a fairly well known figure in close circles for the past 20 years, most of the country just came to know me in the past 18 months.""Primarily at issue, King maintained, was partial reporting of statements made to the media in 2015 by the police officer who checked the ""white"" box on the above-reproduced 1995 police report. King indicated that that officer's statements were deceptively edited in most media reports, and forwarded us a link to an unedited version of the officer's statement. King recapped the allegation::I was very badly assaulted all the way back in March of 1995 in my high school. The detective placed on the case was a actually a very good man named Keith Broughton. [Opponents of the Black Lives Matter movement] used his police report, which marked me as white, as a primary piece of evidence that I am white. I didn't check the box, he did ... I was 15, and this was in 1995. All the way back then it was widely known in my small town that I wasn't white. His statement came from this interview [page no longer exists].As King asserted, Broughton's statement to IJReview undermined claims the officer believed King was white; moreover, that statement was not widely reproduced in the broader coverage of allegations King wasn't black. In that August 2015 statement, Broughton told IJReview King's race was widely understood to be mixed but no box existed for ""biracial"":I believe that he's biracial. I could just tell when I saw him. I marked him white because he's very light complected. He was there with his white mother. My crime report there's only two things you can check: black or white. It doesn't say biracial ... anyone from around here who knew him knew he was mixed.:As Broughton stated, box #33 on the above-reproduced form indeed listed only ""white"" or ""black"" as options in 1995; in 2015 (or 2016) options such as ""Hispanic,"" ""Asian or Pacific Islander,"" and ""other"" were common on standardized forms (and likely assumed by many readers to be common two decades prior as well). King stated that he later spoke to Broughton about the controversy, and that Broughton affirmed ""[h]e told [King] specifically that [Broughton] told this same thing to [other] outlets, but they just didn't mention it.""We investigated King's claim that Broughton's complete statement was absent from contemporaneous reporting, and were unable to locate any other iterations of the quote. Most reports contained the above-reproduced police report, but none we located included the ancillary, current statements from Broughton indicating that both at the time of the 1995 and in 2015, he believed King was biracial. Finally, King pointed us to one of several statements made from classmates of his at the time of the controversy. One was shared in a screenshot to his Facebook page, and was written by a female childhood friend who maintained the claims were absurd based upon her youthful acquaintance with King:::As King asserted, a number of these details were buried in the initial media brouhaha stemming from the Breitbart post. However, aside from photographs, the sole ""evidence"" upon which the claims King fabricated a racial identity were based hinged on a police report from 1995 describing him as white. Exculpatory statements made by Broughton at the time of the controversy may not have been deliberately elided from contemporaneous coverage, but nevertheless were absent from nearly all articles containing the police report.When Broughton's August 2015 statement was taken into consideration, the sole remaining evidence of King's purported fabrication hinged on photographs in which he appeared to possibly be white; however, biracial individuals historically ""passed"" as one race or another depending on circumstances (or even incidentally). While King appeared to be white in some early photos, he also appeared to be biracial or black in separate photos from his youth shared prior to the controversy.[Updated 12 January 2016]:"
12,12,12,115.NoDemocratsandBidenD,"Claim:U.S. President Joe Biden, and other prominent Democrats, engage in harvesting the blood of children as part of a liberal, globalist conspiracy of satanic child sacrifice.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In July 2021, we received several inquiries from Snopes readers regarding remarks that U.S. President Joe Biden made about baseless QAnon-related conspiracy theories which posit that Democrats and political progressives, as a group, ""suck the blood of children."":During a CNN townhall event in Cincinnati, Ohio on July 21, host Don Lemon asked Biden about the partisan rancor surrounding efforts by congressional Democrats to set up an inquiry into the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, and struck a pessimistic note about the broader prospects of bipartisan collaboration, asking Biden: ""If Republicans and Democrats can't come together -- right? -- to investigate the biggest attack on our Capitol in 200 years, what makes you think that they can come together on anything?""In response, Biden spoke about misinformation around the events at the Capitol on Jan. 6, and the role of misinformation and conspiracy theories in deepening mutual misunderstanding and conflict between Democrats and Republicans in the United States. A video of the exchange can be watched below, but the following is an edited transcript of Biden's response:The fact is, you can't look at that television and say, ""Nothing happened on the 6th.""  You can't listen to people who say this was a ""peaceful march."" ...I've been through the other end of this when the Democrats, 35 years ago, were way off to the other side. ...I have faith in the American people -- I really do -- to ultimately get to the right place. And, by the way, many times Republicans are in the right place.  I don't mean that the Repub- -- that it's always the Democratic point of view.  But some of the stuff -- I mean, QAnon: The idea that the Democrats or that Biden is hiding people and sucking the blood of children and -- no, I'm serious.  That's -- Now, you may not like me, and that's your right... But the kinds of things that are being said of late, I think you're beginning to see some of the -- and both -- and by Democrats as well -- sort of the venom get -- sort of -- sort of leak out a lot of it.  We got to get beyond this. :Biden was referring to a set of false claims, linked to the QAnon cluster of conspiracy theories, that ""globalist elites"" including Biden, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and other prominent figures in progressive politics, the news media, and the Democratic party, engage in mass satanic ritual child abuse, including drinking the blood of children. Such claims are utterly false.:During the 2020 presidential election campaign, followers of those theories predominantly supported outgoing President Donald Trump, whom they largely viewed as a tacit supporter or even leader of their (QAnon's) movement, and vehemently opposed Biden, whom they viewed as either complicit, or an active participant in, the nonexistent liberal conspiracy of child sacrifice. In context, then, the sense of Biden's remarks at the CNN townhall in July 2021 was clear, and he was making the perfectly uncontroversial point that while he strongly supports bipartisan collaboration on important matters of policy and procedure, such collaboration is made much more difficult in light of what he regards as misinformation and disagreement about basic facts -- for example, in relation to the events of Jan. 6 -- and the fact that a non-trivial cohort of those who typically vote for Republican House and Senate candidates, believe Biden and other Democrats are engaged in the worst kind of ritual child abuse imaginable. Biden made another reference to the ""drinking children's blood"" theory, while speaking to reporters upon his return to the White House after the CNN townhall on July 21. Shelby Talcott, from the right-wing Daily Caller website, asked Biden about the Democratic position on police reform and the ""defund the police"" movement.:It's important to note that Biden has long since repeatedly clarified that he opposes efforts to ""defund the police,"" and prominent congressional Democrats including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have also pushed back against that movement, popular among some left-wing activists within the Democratic coalition. A video of the brief exchange between Talcott and Biden can be viewed here. Below is a transcript:Talcott: Mr. President, can you clarify what you said about no -- that there's no -- no one in the Democratic Party is anti-police?Biden:  I didn't say that.Talcott: I know that you said you don't want to defund the police --Biden: I said that that -- that is not the Democratic Party's position. Talcott: Okay.Biden: I'm the Democratic Party; I am President.  So is the Speaker of the House and so is the -- the Majority Leader.  We are not the defunding the police.Talcott: Okay.  And are there people who -- in the Democratic Party, who want to defund the police?Biden: Are there people in the Republican Party who think we're sucking the blood out of kids?Talcott: I'm not sure...Biden: [Laughs and walks away].:In context, the sense of Biden's remarks was again clear in this second instance. After Biden made it clear that he and other leaders within the Democratic Party are opposed to defunding the police, Talcott again asked whether some people within the party favored that policy.Biden retorted by asking whether some people within the Republican Party supported the belief that Biden and other Democrats were engaged in child blood harvesting, making the point that controversial views among some party members was not the sole province of the Democrats, and also that those prevalent on the fringes of the GOP were much more destructive and outrageous. One can dispute the accuracy of that argument, but the point being made by Biden was clear and, in itself, coherent.Despite this context, and despite the fact that ""child sacrifice,"" ritual child abuse, and ""blood harvesting"" theories were a highly publicized and widely reported fringe feature of the 2020 presidential election (Trump himself even promoted the false claim that Biden was a pedophile), several right-wing commentators expressed apparent bafflement at Biden's references to ""sucking the blood of children,"" and some described the president as being ""obsessed"" with the subject, thus passively promoting the underlying conspiracy theory of Biden's personal involvement in child sacrifice. :'Perhaps His Answer Is Part of Some Weird Fantasy'For example, on July 23 the right-wing, pro-Trump commentator Benny Johnson, a known source of politically-motivated disinformation, posted a video to Facebook with the headline ""Biden rants about sucking children's blood at the White House,"" a formulation of words which could quite foreseeably promote the outrageous conspiracy itself, because it conspicuously did not make clear that Biden was referring critically to the belief in the conspiracy theory, among some Republicans, rather than ""ranting about sucking children's blood"" itself. The video was also accompanied by a mocked-up photograph of Biden with vampire fangs::Johnson said the president's exchange with Talcott was evidence that he is ""clinically unwell,"" but speculated he may have been referring to ""some fringe QAnon conspiracy theory that no one's ever heard of,"" even though it was widely reported during the 2020 presidential election campaign, and evidently well known enough for Johnson himself to quickly make the obvious connection, which was made even more obvious by the fact that, earlier that same evening, Biden had already explicitly referred to it as a ""QAnon"" theory.Similarly, former Trump campaign attorney Jenna Ellis tweeted out a video clip from the exchange with Talcott, along with the text:  ""Anyone else concerned how obsessed Joe Biden is with sucking blood out of kids?"":Again, this characterization grossly misrepresented the fact that Biden was, for the second time in one evening, citing the existence of a right-wing conspiracy theory about child sacrifice to make a broader point about the difficulties of bipartisan consensus, rather than articulating a personal fixation on the fictional practice of blood harvesting itself. By reframing Biden's remarks in this way, and describing him as ""obsessed,"" Ellis' tweet likely served to further promulgate the underlying conspiracy theory, namely that Biden himself is personally involved in drinking children's blood. Likewise, the conservative website Red State called Biden's remarks ""creepy"" and speculated: ""Perhaps his answer is part of some weird fantasy he's been suppressing...""If, at first glance, Biden's remarks appeared odd, that's because the conspiracy theory to which he was referring is, itself, exceedingly weird. In bringing it up on July 21, Biden was highlighting a real, widely known and highly publicized conspiracy theory, popular among a vocal cohort of right-wing Americans and supporters of Trump, as an example of the kind of rhetorical excesses that have taken root among sections of the right in recent years, as well as an inflammatory set of allegations that, for obvious reasons, has the potential to constitute a two-way obstacle to bipartisan cooperation. :Any response or commentary that expresses bafflement or concern about the sense of Biden's remarks must therefore be indicative of either blatant intellectual dishonesty, or an unfortunate lack of basic knowledge about political rhetoric in the United States in the past few years.Finally, Snopes itself was caught up in the wave of reactions to Biden's remarks. On July 23, Kyle Mann, editor-in-chief of the self-described satirical website the Babylon Bee, tweeted out what appeared to be a screenshot from a Snopes fact check of the claim ""Do Democrats suck the blood of children?"" along with the rating ""Mostly False.""Mann added: ""Well that's a relief,"" with the point being that any rating other than ""False"" would seem to imply there was, rather worryingly, an element of truth to the claim that Democrats ""suck the blood of children""::Of course, the screenshot was entirely bogus, and there is not an iota of truth to that claim. Snopes had not published any such fact check at the time Mann posted his tweet, and this fact check carries an unequivocal rating of ""False."""
13,13,13,598.HowaRetiredScientist,"1. THE CURECancer, in all its forms, has been cured. This remains a perceived truth in the corners of the Internet where supplements and conspiracy theories are peddled. A particular cure named GcMAF (short for ""Gc protein-derived macrophage activating factor,"" which is a chemically altered form of a natural protein that allegedly stimulates the activity of a specific kind of white blood cell) ""has the potential to be a universal cure for cancer"", the alternative health and 9/11 Truth website Natural News proclaimed in July 2015.""[GcMAF] is also believed,"" the web site also reported, ""to be capable of treating and reversing autism, HIV, liver/kidney disease and diabetes."" Rumor has it that GcMAF has the potential to be a cure for even more diseases, such as herpes, as well.GcMAF's promise as a cure for cancer (and more) has caught up not only those who frequent fringe medical sites online, but also those seeking to profit from it. In 2009, an Israeli pharmaceutical company purchased the intellectual property behind the GcMAF therapy, and since around 2010 at least three companies have been promoting, have sold, or are currently selling, some version of the cure. The founder of one of the most prominent of those companies, David Noakes of Immuno Biotech Ltd., will soon be appearing in court to face charges that include conspiring to manufacture a medicinal product without a license.:Although GcMAF is not approved for use as a medical treatment in the United States, some American doctors still promote or discuss its use through their practices' web sites. Hundreds of pages of online message board conversations document online conversations between gravely sick people wondering if, perhaps, this storied cure will be the one that finally saves them. Inevitably, these conversations end up pointing to shady web sites purporting to sell the GcMAF cure.An international crackdown on the promotion and sale of this ""wonder cure"" in late 2015 pushed its promoters deeper and deeper into the fringes of the Internet, allowing GcMAF to become the original basis for a wildly incoherent (and completely false) conspiracy theory about ""holistic doctors"" being murdered by some ill-defined cabal of nefarious government agents furtively working on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry.""A breakthrough cancer treatment appears to be the reason why a handful of holistic doctors were recently found 'suicided,'"" trumpeted Health Nut News founder Erin Elizabeth in August 2016. ""Haven't heard about GcMAF as a viable cure against cancer?"" Natural News asked, with an answer already in mind. ""That's because none of their studies became widely known until the doctors themselves started dying."":In a sense, GcMAF is the perfect cure to appeal to the Internet's pseudoscientific alternative health underbelly, even if that audience was perhaps not GcMAF's original target. On these web sites, the primacy of ""natural"" cures over man-made ones reigns blindly supreme, and one of the most popular tropes used by these sites to play into that narrative is that a ""supplement"" (which is how GcMAF is typically marketed) is a tool that allows your body to do the dirty work of curing what ails you without the need for any of those nasty man-made pharmaceuticals. That, in theory, is what GcMAF is supposed to do.GcMAF, according to those promoting that cure, is a chemically altered form of a molecule naturally found in human blood that, when injected into the bloodstream, stimulates the activity of macrophages, a crucial form of white blood cell that can (in essence) ingest a variety of foreign substances found in the bloodstream or in other tissues they migrate to.There is one other chemical crucial to the purported mechanism behind GcMAF: an enzyme dubbed NaGalase. The idea behind it, as presented primarily by the work of a single scientist, is that cancerous cells (and other diseases) are capable of shutting down macrophage activity by releasing this enzyme. That enzyme makes those macrophages dormant, the argument goes, thereby making it harder for your body to fight a cancer and other ailments. Inject your body with some GcMAF, and these macrophages escape their ""zombie"" state and get right to work -- or so its promoters claim.:In scientific studies, GcMAF's efficacy has been tested by using NaGalase as an indicator for cancer load or other ailments, with a decrease in NaGalase being a sign of efficacy. In a fairly open and shut case of circular logic, however, both GcMAF, and the NaGalase test that is meant to monitor GcMAF therapy, were patented by the same man: Dr. Nobuto Yamamoto.2. THE PIONEERIt would be easy, looking at the claims made of his research, to dismiss the self-described pioneer of GcMAF as a snake oil salesman, but a deep dive into his career does not offer such an easy out. Dr. Yamamoto, now 92 years old and (as he told us over the phone) still actively engaged in research, has had what can easily be described as a long and very productive career as a scientist. With a publishing record going back at least to 1957 to the present, he has seen his work published in some of the world's most prestigious scientific journals, including a 1964 paper in Science and multiple papers in Proceedings in the National Academy of Sciences.Dr. Yamamoto, who holds a PhD in biochemistry from Gifu University in Japan, has been a US-based researcher since 1959, when he was invited to be a visiting associate researcher at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. He was later hired as a biophysics and biochemistry researcher at the National Institute of Health in Maryland before becoming associated, in multiple capacities, with Temple University in Philadelphia until 1980. He then took a post at the Hahnemann University School of Medicine, now a part of Drexel University (also in Philadelphia).:In 1987, as a professor at Hahnemann, Dr. Yamamoto published a paper in the journal Cancer Research that would become the basis for the concept he later termed GcMAF. He officially left academia in 1993, but then took a post at a private hospital named the Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia, and it was there that he began focusing myopically on GcMAF, publishing a number of early papers relevant to GcMAF.:One paper co-written by Yamamoto and published in 1996 listed a woman named Sucha Asbell (a former medical student in Philadelphia and now a radiation oncologist at Cooper Health) as a co-author. When we contacted Dr. Asbell about the paper, she told us by telephone that she did briefly work with Yamamoto, supplying him with blood samples from cancer patients under her care at the request of a superior, but had been unaware that authorship credit for the paper in question had been attributed to her until an NGO that investigates fraudulent cancer cures raised concerns about the research in 2014. Asbell, who described Yamamoto as having been a ""bit of a wacko"", said she didn't know when or why Yamamoto parted ways with the Einstein Medical Center, but she told us she had heard rumors that he ""left in a huff.""It is clear, at the very least, that Yamamoto ran into serious problems with the administrators at Einstein around that time. Although a media representative for Einstein initially denied to us that any records supported the claim that Yamamoto had ever worked for them, a human resources representative there later confirmed to us that Yamamoto's employment, which began in June 1993, was terminated in June 1999. A variety of partial or unverified accounts of why this may have happened, but no definitive answers, have been offered.:Allegations of misconduct were leveled against Yamamoto, charges which were damaging enough for Yamamoto to respond by filing a lawsuit against both Einstein and their then-Director of Research and Technology Development for ""libel, slander, and misrepresentation."" Yamamoto himself told us that Einstein's then-director of cancer research was ""a very bad person"" who was trying to eliminate superior researchers from the facility for his own gain, and that he himself had never sued Einstein or anyone else over his termination because it would have been too much work. However, we were able to obtain a court docket indicating that Yamamoto was indeed the plaintiff in a libel suit filed against Einstein's Director of Research, which was eventually settled out of court. (The complete records of that case were destroyed in 2004.)In correspondence between Yamamoto and the editor of the journal Translational Oncology regarding the concerns raised by an investigation into his work (which we were able to obtain), Yamamoto seemed to suggest that claims of misconduct leveled against him were genuine but were, in his view, unrelated to research practices and ultimately the result of a financial misunderstanding::We found no definitive proof that Yamamoto was fired from his position at Einstein for any kind of misconduct, although the lawsuits he filed against his former employer suggest that he was portrayed in a negative way to which he objected, and that around that time his employment was terminated. Einstein would not confirm the details of Yamamoto's termination or acknowledge the lawsuit, and although we sent multiple requests for comment to an individual listed as a defendant in that case, we received no response.:Nonetheless, it was around the time that Yamamoto left Einstein that he began to describe himself as director of the Socrates Institute, which is located in his home. His six-year publication hiatus ended in 2006 with his paper about the utility of NaGalase as an indicator of progress for AIDS treatment, and beginning in 2008 he published the four papers most frequently cited in favor of GcMAF's efficacy against both AIDS and cancer.The most notable of these papers, published in the International Journal of Cancer, claimed metastasizing breast cancer cells had been successfully destroyed with GcMAF. Another 2008 paper, this one published in Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy, claimed that GcMAF was effective as a treatment for colorectal cancer. A 2009 paper published in the Journal of Medical Virology, made the astounding claim that HIV-infected patients were ""rapidly cured"" by GcMAF therapy. The inclusion of these three papers in scientific literature would be short lived, however.By 2015, these papers had all been retracted by the journals that published them, thanks to the work of the Anticancer Fund, a Belgian-based NGO that ""investigates the information on cancer therapies for evidence, so that evidence-based treatment choices can be made"", according to their website. ""After several patients asked our organization [...] about GcMAF as a cancer treatment, we decided to look for the evidence supporting its use in cancer,"" they told the academic watchdog Retraction Watch in a July 2014 article.:The Anticancer Fund's main scientific problem with the research behind those papers, laid out in a statement posted on their web site, was that the researchers did not actually measure tumor growth or decline directly but instead relied on NaGalase, which the researchers had claimed as an accurate measurement of tumor load in a human body even though it is not widely accepted as a valid analytical tool for this purpose. Nonetheless, it wasn't those scientific concerns that lead to the retractions of Yamamoto's papers: the main issue was that little (if any) independent documentation existed about the patients involved in the studies or their approval for participation in medical trials. The official justification for each of these retractions, according to statements provided by the respective journals, was that they were due to ""irregularities in the documentation for institutional review board approval"". In essence, this meant the journals felt the papers' authors could not adequately prove that their trials had been approved by any academic board, or had been conducted in the manner claimed in those authors' subsequent papers.3. THE INSTITUTEWe spoke to Ana Ugarte, a doctor and medical researcher involved in the Anticancer Fund's investigation of GcMAF, about the issues that resulted in the retraction of the three papers prepared by the Socrates Institute. Contrary to the muted and official tone taken by the Anticancer Fund, the process behind the investigation led Ugarte, and later us, down what can only be described as an increasingly absurd rabbit hole.Although the Anticancer Fund never explicitly made such a claim in any of their official publications, Ugarte personally suspected that the Socrates Institute, which shares the address of Yamamoto's private home and was established as tax-exempt organization in November 1998, was, by and large, a made-up entity. Perhaps the most consequential aspect of Socrates Institute revolved around a man named Hirofumi Suyama, who retired from the Nagasaki Medical school in 1987. Although Suyama was credited as an author in a number of Socrates publications and was listed on tax documents as vice director of the Socrates Institute in 2007, Suyama had not published anything since 1991.:The Anticancer Fund's Ugarte tried fruitlessly to get in touch with this man, but according to Yamamoto, Suyama died in July of 2011 (although tax documents listed him a vice director of Socrates in 2011). Yamamoto did not directly confirm Suyama's death to us (and we have been unable to independently verify whether Suyama is dead or alive), but he used Suyama's passing as an explanation for a lack of complete documentation regarding the approval of the clinical trials he published data from to the editor of Translational Oncology.Suyama's inclusion as an alleged participant in the Socrates Institute, as well as his death, are suspiciously convenient to Yamamoto, as he appears to be using the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval from a place where Suyama once worked to claim that the clinical trials from which Yamamoto generated his data were legally conducted. (A committee such as the IRB is formally designated by a university to approve and monitor the ethics of research on humans.)The IRB which Yamamoto claims signed off on his research was allegedly convened in 1995 at a research institute in Japan. As far as we can tell, however, the only documentation of this review committee is the cover page of a press release Yamamoto provided to editors of Translational Oncology (below) when asked to document his IRB approval. Additional details of this review process appear to have died with Suyama -- at least, according to Yamamoto.::Echoing the concerns of the Anticancer Fund, Dwight McKee, an oncologist with an interest in integrative and alternative treatments for cancer who began to work with Yamamoto on clinical trials of GcMAF around 2009, told us he was unnerved by some of the ethical decisions Yamamoto was making.McKee told us that, for the medical trial he was collaborating on with Yamamoto (whose data he said were not published), Yamamoto was attempting to register American stage four cancer patients for a medical trial using IRB approval from a foreign institution. McKee told us that he had his own lawyer look into the legality of entering patients ""on an informed consent, clinical trial, through a foreign university"" and found that it was a grey area but ""probably not completely defensible."" McKee said he thought at the time that he and Yamamoto were conducting a legal and legitimate clinical trial, but, he said, ""it was much fuzzier than that"". The two parted ways after these revelations.Aside from these ethical concerns about research methodology, it appears that many members listed as both authors and directors at the Socrates Institute actually had little, if anything, to do with that organization. Suspicions of potentially deceased people working for the Socrates Institute are not limited to Dr. Suyama: Socrates' 2011 tax filing also lists Theodore Sery, a collaborator with Yamamoto in the 1990s, as a ""trustee"", although Sery died in January of that year.:Indeed, the group of principal employees of the Socrates Institute seems to be composed of retired professors who have (what sometimes appear to have been tangential) relationships to Yamamoto's academic past, or who are former postdocs or students of Yamamoto's from decades prior. According to tax filings, none of the members listed as directors or trustees of Socrates has ever received any compensation, and the majority of the institute's expenses appear to be publication fees.Perhaps the most enigmatic piece of information obtained through examining tax records is the inclusion of a man named Nobuyuki Yamamoto as a deputy director of the Socrates Institute between 2005 and 2007. Based on records we obtained in addition to the address listed on tax filings, Nobuyuki is Yamamoto's son. However, prior to our informing the senior Yamamoto of our possession of this information, he told us that Nobuyuki Yamamoto was not his son; then, when confronted with this evidence, Yamamoto then corrected himself.This reversal could be, perhaps, written off as a slip of the tongue, but it needs be mentioned that there is in fact another Nobuyuki Yamamoto who does cancer research and has a publishing history that is superficially similar to the work performed at Socrates. This other Nobuyuki Yamamoto is evidently unrelated to Nobuto Yamamoto (we reached out to the former and received no response), but his sharing a name with Nobuto Yamamoto's son serves, either intentionally or accidentally, to insert the work of the Socrates Institute into the same scientific literature searches as genuinely legitimate, but wholly unrelated, research.:The Nobuyuki affiliated with Socrates, who we presume is Nobuto's son based on our conversations with the latter, is listed as an author on a number of the 2008 and 2009 papers as well. The Nobuyuki Yamamoto at Socrates is not a medical researcher or a practicing scientist, however: Nobuyuki has a masters degree in marine microbiology, and now in his sixties, he works as an IT director at West Chester University.One could make that argument that none of these perhaps superficially minor discrepancies matters if Yamamoto's science holds up, a point that Yamamoto firmly, and to our ears sincerely, stands by. Such an argument, however, ignores the role that academic or professional research institutions have in ensuring that research that is conducted ethically and without bias. Because of his position outside of accredited physical institutions, Yamamoto seems to have developed a disregard for the foundations of the scientific process, most notably, the accurate representation of scientific participation and consensus.:That viewpoint is explicitly evident in the authorship of one of the papers that, despite the Anticancer Fund's best efforts, remains unretracted. That paper (""Immunotherapy for Prostate Cancer with Gc Protein-Derived Macrophage-Activating Factor, GcMAF""), published by Translational Oncology in 2008, lists Nobotu Yamamoto, his son Nobuyuki Yamamoto, and Hirofumi Suyama (a man who retired from active research in 1987) as authors. This seemingly false representation of consensus has ramifications far outside the scientific realm.4. THE FALLOUTEvidently convinced of both the potential of GcMAF and the legitimacy of the Socrates Institute, Yamamoto successfully sold his patents for GcMAF and related intellectual property to an Israeli biopharmaceutical company, Efranat Macrophage, in November 2009. An archived version of that company's web site from 2013 prominently shows Yamamoto as a ""co-founder"" and inventor of GcMAF. Now, however, all mention of Yamamoto has been removed from the site. Efranat is still working to find a use for GcMAF, but they have now rebranded it as a compound called ""EF-022"", changing the name of the chemical midway through a clinical trial. (Efranat did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this article.):Nobutu Yamamoto, center, with Efranat co-founders Boaz Shoham (left) and Avi Levin (right) from an archived version of that company's website as it appeared in 2013.Beginning in 2010, following the publication of the Socrates papers, a separate online entity unrelated to Efranat Macrophage appeared that gradually evolved into David Noakes' Immuno Biotech, a firm that produced and heavily promoted GcMAF (which cannot be legally marketed). ""One time our patent lawyer tried to sue Noakes in England but he escaped,"" Yamamoto said in a letter to the editor of Translational Oncology.Jeffrey Bradstreet was a controversial American doctor involved with Noakes' Immuno Biotech. Bradstreet, who had previously published a number of papers suggesting that GcMAF could ""cure"" children with autism, and his suicide following a raid on that company (and his own clinic) spawned the aforementioned conspiracy theories about the government's and Big Pharma's merciless goal to hide a cure for cancer. The raid on Immuno Biotech's production facility that preceded Bradstreet's death revealed that materials used in their production of their GcMAF (i.e., blood plasma) were explicitly labeled that they not be administered to humans or used in the production of drugs.Yet another group in Japan created and patented what they call ""second generation GcMAF,"" announcing the therapy in a misleading  in the journal Nature Outlooks that was formatted to look like a peer-reviewed study (and has been cited as such). This company still actively promotes and sells GcMAF products, according to their web site.:Aside from the safety issues created by the undervetted promotion of GcMAF by online profiteers, the viral promotion of conspiracy theories suggesting that sinister government or corporate entities are purposely keeping GcMAF from the public means that those who search online for cures for cancer, AIDS, or other ailments in the wake of terrifying diagnoses are likely to find information about GcMAF and led into believing in what is almost assuredly a false ray of hope. That ray of hope would be misleadingly supported by the appearance of legitimate-looking research presented by an institute run from a retired scientist's home: Although three of the papers from the Socrates Institute were retracted, PDF versions of them are still in wide circulation without noting their retractions, and other GcMAF papers are still part of the scientific literature.Translational Oncology, after receiving the same responses from Yamamoto that we were able to obtain, declined to retract Yamamoto's paper asserting that GcMAF may be a therapy for prostate cancer. The Socrates's Institute's 2006 paper on the utility of NaGalese as an indicator for AIDS, published in the journal AIDS Research & Human Retroviruses, remains in the record as well.:Legitimate questions remain to be asked of other papers that have been published without the knowledge of the people who are listed as their co-authors, as was the case with Sucha Asbell in 1996. That paper, and a number of others from Yamamoto's Einstein Medical Center years, are also still part of the scientific literature.One could argue Yamamoto's most evident transgressions were the desire to protect the intellectual property resulting from his work, and to be considered as a legitimate scientist when he was without an institution to support his efforts. Such an argument ignores the fallout created by proliferation and support of this kind of research, which gives false hope to patients, enables Internet hucksters, and leads to potential delays in more effective treatment.This proliferation of questionable research also masks the legitimate concern that Yamamoto's unyielding faith in his own work may cloud his responsibility to present it objectively. Dr. McKee, the man who left Yamamoto's lab for legal and ethical reasons, told us that GcMAF seemed to have some anticancer properties but ""it was not of the degree that Dr. Yamamoto believed it to be"". He also told us that he thought it could possibly be a useful medicine, but that it would need to be combined with other therapies. Dr. Yamamoto, he said, wanted it to be the cure for cancer.:Yamamoto, for his part, tells us that the Socrates Institute has a groundbreaking paper coming out soon, alleging that GcMAF can be a cure for ""all disease."" Let us hope that this time, the Internet and the scientific publishing system will be ready to put these forthcoming results into the context they require."

Rating:FalseAbout this rating ContextIn 2018, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla mentioned a pill that had been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration a few months prior that contained a digital sensor that could track whether or not the medicine had been taken. This product was approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Contrary to online rumors, this comment was completely unrelated to vaccines or the COVID-19 pandemic. :Snopes is still fighting an ""infodemic"" of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

In December 2021, a video supposedly showing Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla talking about microchips in the COVID-19 vaccine started to circulate on social media. A number of social media users posted this video with a copied and pasted piece of text that read: ""Pfizer CEO Bourla talking about the microchip that will be in medications. Sounds normal right?? Just a conspiracy theory?? #Pfizer #Vaccines."":This video was taken in 2018, years before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and has nothing to do with COVID-19 vaccines. This video was taken during the World Economic Forum in 2018. A guest asked the panel about how medical professionals could better engage with patients, noting that even if they made the best medicine that there was ""no guarantee that the patient was going to take the drug."" Bourla responded by saying that the FDA had recently approved a pill that contained a digital sensor which could track if the medicine had been ingested. Bourla said: ""Maybe I will use an example. I think it is fascinating what is happening in this field right now. The FDA approved the first electronic pill, if I can call it that, it's basically a biological chip that is in the tablet and once you take the table it sends a signal that you took the tablet. Imagine the implications of that compliance. The insurance companies can know that the medicines that patients should take they do take them. It is fascinating what happens in this field.""Bourla appears to be referring to Abilify MyCite, an aripiprazole tablet with a sensor that detects when a pill has been ingested that was approved by the FDA a few months before this video was taken.:Regarding the tablet, the FDA wrote in a release:The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved the first drug in the U.S. with a digital ingestion tracking system. Abilify MyCite (aripiprazole tablets with sensor) has an ingestible sensor embedded in the pill that records that the medication was taken. The product is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute treatment of manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and for use as an add-on treatment for depression in adults.The system works by sending a message from the pill's sensor to a wearable patch. The patch transmits the information to a mobile application so that patients can track the ingestion of the medication on their smart phone. Patients can also permit their caregivers and physician to access the information through a web-based portal.""Being able to track ingestion of medications prescribed for mental illness may be useful for some patients,"" said Mitchell Mathis, M.D., director of the Division of Psychiatry Products in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ""The FDA supports the development and use of new technology in prescription drugs and is committed to working with companies to understand how technology might benefit patients and prescribers."":Bourla was not talking about vaccines, he was not talking about COVID-19, and he was not talking about microchips. The CEO of Pfizer was talking about a new product that could help mental illness patients and caregivers track when medication had been ingested. The full exchange can be viewed below, starting at the 45:20 mark::This clip was widely shared on social media as if it contained some sort of ""gotcha"" moment proving that the conspiratorial notion that the vaccines contain microchips is real. If Bourla was talking about microchips in medicine in 2018, the flawed argument holds, then of course they're being added to the COVID-19 vaccines. There are a number of flaws in this argument. For starters, Bourla was not talking about ""microchips."" While ""microchip"" has become a bit of an all-encompassing term, it is generally used in conspiracy theory contexts to refer to a ""tracking device"" that has been secretly inserted into an unwilling individual. But that's not the case here. This sensor does not track a person's whereabouts or do anything other than send an alert to a phone that a medicine has been ingested.These conspiracy theories often hinge on notions of secrecy and underhanded plots, yet the evidence provided tends to point back to publicly available FDA news releases. In the video above, for example, Bourla is talking about a product that was approved by the FDA. The FDA has also issued releases regarding the COVID-19 vaccine, and none of those make any mention of microchips. You can read more about the ingredients in the COVID-19 vaccines in a previous article. :Furthermore, the fact that microchips and biosensors exist is not proof that they exist in  COVID-19 vaccine. In the video above, Bourla is simply discussing a recent development in the biosensor field. This is not evidence that biosensors are also in the COVID-19 vaccine and in the video above Bourla makes no such claim.  "
15,15,15,36.SandyHookParentsSueC,"The parents of two children murdered in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary school massacre have filed two separate defamation lawsuits against conspiracy-peddling troll Alex Jones and his InfoWars network.Neil Heslin, the father of 6-year-old Jesse Lewis, along with Leonard Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa, the parents of 6-year-old Noah Pozner, are both seeking damages in excess of $1,000,000 in a lawsuit filed on 16 April 2018 in Travis County District Court in Austin, Texas, where InfoWars is based.InfoWars has made it a mission to paint victims and survivors of the Sandy Hook massacre -- in which 20 young children and six adults were killed by a gunman -- as actors in a ""false flag"" attack. As a result, grieving loved ones have been relentlessly stalked, harassed and threatened by ""hoaxers"" who buy into these narratives, which are easily disprovable and wholly without merit.According to court documents, Jones and cohost Owen Shroyer have been smearing parents with rants and false commentary that weaves their tragedy into a delusional New World Order conspiracy theory, in which they claim that mass shootings are staged incidents created by a secret, all-powerful cabal in an effort to seize Americans' guns and establish an autocratic global government.:Bill Ogden, an attorney for the parents, told us:This case has absolutely nothing to do with the First Amendment. This case has to do with a media source that touts itself as seeking the truth but makes false claims about people. That's why we have defamation laws. When you point out specific people and call them liars, and say they didn't hold their dead children in their arms, there are consequences for that.An attorney for InfoWars did not respond to our request for comment.Both lawsuits claim that Jones and InfoWars targeted the parents for harassment by telling their viewers that they were liars engaged in a scheme to cover up a ""false flag,"" or a mass casualty event staged by the government as a pretext for ramped-up repression. InfoWars co-host Shroyer, for example, made an easily-debunked claim that Heslin had been dishonest during a June 2017 interview with NBC host Megyn Kelly when he said he had held his son's bullet-ridden body in his arms, because the victims of the shooting were identified using photographs.:But, obviously, the bodies were later released to families so that they could hold funerals for their loved ones, which the news media covered extensively. According to court documents:Shroyer's report was manifestly false. In addition, a minimal amount of research would have caused any competent journalist not to publish the defamatory accusation. According to contemporary news accounts, the bodies of the victims were released from the medical examiner into the custody of the families.Funerals where the children's bodies were in the custody of their parents were widely reported on by the press.Jones also claimed an interview De La Rosa did with CNN journalist Anderson Cooper was faked and done on a set, in an effort to label her a ""crisis actor"":Mr. Jones' assertion that Plaintiff Veronique De La Rosa participated in a faked blue-screen interview from a remote location is manifestly false. Mr. Jones' assertion that the interview did not take place in front of the Edmond Town Hall is also manifestly false. The visual effect described by Mr. Jones is the result of motion compensation video compression, which would have been readily ascertainable at the time Mr. Jones made his claims.Nonetheless, after five years, Mr. Jones continues to push this sick lie about Mrs. De La Rosa and her interview.:Of Heslin, Pozner and De La Rosa, Ogden told us:Sadly this has gone all the way up through death threats. So not only can these people not grieve in peace, they're now looking over their shoulders 24/7.Jones is also being sued by Marcel Fontaine, a 24-year-old Massachusetts man falsely accused by InfoWars of being the gunman in the 14 February 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where seventeen people were murdered. The InfoWars post claimed the shooter ""dressed like a communist"" and that the ""MSM"" -- conspiracy-speak for ""mainstream media"" were covering it up. The post has since been retracted but still contains a link to another bogus story alleging there was a second shooter in Parkland.Some who buy into the same conspiracy theory InfoWars traffics have been arrested for taking their conspiratorial thinking into the real world.:In 2015, hoaxer Matthew Mills of New York was arrested at an annual marathon held in honor of Sandy Hook teacher Vikki Soto for stalking and harassing Soto's sister.In 2017, Lucy Richards, a 57-year-old Florida woman, was sentenced to five months in prison for sending death threats to Pozner in which she said:Did you hide your imaginary son in the attic? Are you still fucking him? You fucking Jew bastard. Jew bastard. Look behind you. Death is coming to you real soon.In March 2018, Robert Ussery and Jodi Mann, hoaxers who go by the social media handles Side Thorn and Conspiracy Granny respectively, were arrested for trespassing after verbally assaulting the pastor of First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, whose 14-year-old daughter was among 26 people killed in the 5 November 2017 mass shooting there.In February 2018, three other conspiratorial web sites, GotNews, TheGatewayPundit.com and FreedomDaily.com were also hit with a defamation lawsuit after falsely accusing an innocent person of driving the car that ran down counter-protesters, killing a woman, at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in August 2017.:A Facebook page run Sandy Hook hoaxers has also been removed by Facebook; it is now being controlled by anti-hoaxers who asked to remain anonymous for security reasons."

And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. :In May 2020, as the drug Remdesivir was being explored as a potential treatment for the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, a widespread social media post posited a sprawling conspiracy involving U.S. biopharmaceutical company Gilead, China, the international medical organization Unitaid, George Soros, Bill Gates, the World Health Organization, Hillary Clinton, and National Institute of Allergy, and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci. The theory holds that together they were trying to suppress the supposedly highly effective drug Hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 in favor of Remdesivir::The disconnected statements offered in support of the conspiracy theory added up to nothing, but some of them individually had varying amounts of truth to them, which we briefly survey below.Some very preliminary research has suggested that Remdesivir, a drug originally developed to target Ebola, may show some promise as a treatment (not a ""cure"") for COVID-19.The patent for Remdesivir is held by Gilead Sciences, a California-based biopharmaceutical company.In January 2020, the Wuhan Institute of Virology of the China Academy of Sciences applied to patent the use of Remdesivir in China. Even if that application were granted, it would have very limited scope and would not mean that China would ""own"" the patent to Remdesivir:""Even if the Wuhan Institute's application gets authorized, the role is very limited because Gilead still owns the fundamental patent of the drug,"" said Zhao Youbin, a Shanghai-based intellectual property counsel at Purplevine IP Service Co. ""Any exploitation of the patent must seek approval from Gilead."":Unitaid is an international organization that invests in innovations to prevent, diagnose, and treat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria more quickly, affordably and effectively. Unitaid also works to improve access to diagnostics and treatment for HIV co-infections such as hepatitis C and human papillomavirus (HPV), and they have ""moved quickly to reshape its programs to contribute to the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic."" Unitaid is not ""Gilead's drug patent sharing subsidiary branch"" (or any other form subsidiary of Gilead), the organization told us, nor does Unitaid have an office near Wuhan, China. (Unitaid has a single office location in Geneva, Switzerland.):Unitaid's ""About Us"" website page notes that the organization ""is a hosted partnership of the World Health Organization"" (from whom they receive no financial support), and Unitaid's ""Investing in Unitaid"" page states that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is a main donor. Unitaid has no past or current links, financial or otherwise, with George Soros or Fauci, the organization told us via email.During the 2016 presidential campaign cycle, individuals associated with Gilead donated to Hillary Clinton's campaign (and to many other candidates from both parties). Nonetheless, during that campaign, Clinton asserted she would ""go after drug companies that charge exorbitant prices"" and singled out Gilead, ""whose hepatitis C drugs cost between $900 and $1,000 per pill in the United States."" In response to our query, Unitaid informed us that it did not provide financial or other support to the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential election campaign.Between 2014 and 2019, the EcoHealth Alliance was awarded a series of grants totaling approximately $3.7 million by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, of which Fauci is the director, to study the ""risk of future coronavirus (CoV) emergence from wildlife using in-depth field investigations across the human-wildlife interface in China."" Only a portion of this money has been used to fund research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, however.:The anti-malarial drug Hydroxychloroquine, much-touted by U.S. President Donald Trump as a potential COVID-19 treatment, does not have a proven ""92% success rate"" in treating patients with that disease. Rather, according to a ""finding from a retrospective analysis conducted by the U.S. Veterans Health Administration,"" hydroxychloroquine for treatment of patients with COVID-19, ""combined with or without azithromycin, not only may not help mitigate the virus' effect, it also may increase overall mortality."""
17,17,17,438.WasBarackObamaNamedi,"Claim:President Obama is being sued for ""inciting violence"" against police.Rating:OutdatedAbout this rating In June 2017, a lawsuit filed by a man named Larry Klayman against President Barack Obama, George Soros, Black Lives Matter, Hillary Clinton, the Nation of Islam, and several others for inciting violence against police officers was dismissed.In 2018, dubious ""news"" web sites such as Guerrilla.News continued to post about this lawsuit as if it was still recent, relevant, and ongoing::FEDERAL LAWSUIT Names Obama, Holder, Sharpton, Farrakhan, BLM Leaders for ""INCITING VIOLENCE"" Against PoliceIt seems as though Former President Barack Obama may have some regrets after supporting Black Lives Matter. He was so adamant about pushing the cop-hating and white-hating mentality that was the catalyst in further dividing Americans, but now it seems to all have backfired. A conservative activist is in the process of holding Obama and his black extremist peers responsible for the hate that they have built through their idiotic persistence.Former prosecutor Larry Klayman is sick and tired of the cop-killing and extreme animosity towards police. He recently filed a lawsuit against a group of defendants that he believes are responsible for instigating the hateful crime spree.This lawsuit was filed by Larry Klayman in July 2016 in the United States District Court of the Northern District of Texas on behalf of himself and Dallas Police Sargent Demetrick Pennie, shortly after five police officers were killed by a sniper. The lawsuit accused Obama and 16 other defendants of inciting ""their supporters and others to engage in threats of and attacks to cause serious bodily injury or death upon police officers and other law enforcement persons of all races and ethnicity including but not limited to Jews, Christians and Caucasians.""  It was dismissed in June 2017::With respect to Defendants President Obama and General Holder, the court grants their Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 21), as Plaintiffs lack Article III standing, and accordingly dismisses without prejudice Count Three for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). Counts One and Two are dismissed without prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(A)(i), as Plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed these claims against President Obama and General Holder, and no answer or motion for summary judgment has been filed by either Defendant.Klayman has a long history of filing frivolous lawsuits. In fact, during the back-and-fourth litigation of the aforementioned lawsuit, the court warned Klayman about filing more ""nonsensical documents"" and threatened him with a fine:ORDER: The record reflects Mr. Klayman's predilection for filing frivolous, nonsensical, and vituperative documents, in the form of notices, motions, briefs, etc., in response to unfavorable rulings. The court has grown weary of Mr. Klayman's tactics. If Mr. Klayman files any further frivolous or nonsensical documents in this matter, the court will personally sanction him monetarily. The court directs the Clerk to strike ""Plaintiffs' Response to the Court's Order Denying Motion for Leave to File Notice of New Case Authority Re: Memorandum Opinion and Order in Nwanguma v. Trump""(Doc. 132 ). (Ordered by Judge Sam A Lindsay on 4/13/2017) (axm) (Entered: 04/14/2017):It appears that Klayman escaped discipline during the course of these legal proceedings, but the conservative attorney has not always been so lucky. In a 2017 profile of the conservative attorney, TheHill.com noted that Klayman has been formally disciplined by multiple courts:In a 2016 opinion, a federal court of appeals noted 12 cases ""in which Klayman's ability to practice law in an ethical and orderly manner was called into question.""Klayman, an avid supporter of the ""birther"" conspiracy theory, also once filed a petition to get Obama deported. Klayman has also referred to Obama as a ""Muslim king"" and once held a ""citizen's grand jury"" (which had no legal authority) in an attempt to charge Obama with fraud for becoming president. The activist lawyer's documents have no force of law and compel no government action, serving instead as self-published expressions of his political viewpoint."
18,18,18,677.DoesBidenWantFraudul,"Claim:President-elect Joe Biden's campaign directed elections officials to consider ballots valid even if they are fake, manipulated, or cast by ineligible or deceased voters.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.In the aftermath of the 2020 U.S. presidential election, U.S. President Donald Trump and his team launched a massive misinformation campaign to try to convince Americans that his political opponents were running a grand conspiracy to undermine Trump's reelection. (Read more fact checks like this one here.):As part of that communication strategy, the Trump campaign alleged without evidence that Joe Biden -- who was projected the winner on Nov. 7 -- only secured the popular vote in key battleground states because polling workers there had counted all ballots, regardless of their legality. In several emails obtained by Snopes, the campaign alleged: ""The Biden campaign wants ballots counted even if they are fraudulent, manufactured, or cast by ineligible or deceased voters."":The claim was false. No evidence showed president-elect Biden, nor any other Democrat, was engaged in large-scale electoral fraud, nor that his campaign wanted ineligible ballots to count in the 2020 presidential election. Rather, Biden's campaign framed such claims by Trump as attempts to stop the democratic process.:Nonetheless, this baseless allegation by Trump appeared verbatim and in alternate forms across social media in the days after polls closed. Here, for example, we debunked one viral video that Trump and his supporters claimed showed Biden ""admitting"" to voter fraud, when, in reality, that wasn't the case.All states require voters to be U.S. citizens, over age 18, and meet certain residency requirements to legally vote. Additionally, eligible mail-in ballots must meet postmarking deadlines, which vary by state, and include signatures of voters.But local governments  -- not politicians in Washington, D.C., including Biden -- establish rules governing the process for counting votes. In fact, most state laws grant counties the authority to administer elections via a board of electors, an election official or officials, or both. As a result, thousands of local jurisdictions come together to run federal elections, including presidential races, and they all operate under their own rules governing vote counting. Many state laws allow mail-in ballots received after Election Day to be counted.For the alleged conspiracy to be true, Biden's team would have had to infiltrate a variety of election boards or jurisdictions, and direct their poll workers to count fake ballots or those completed by ineligible voters, despite state laws imposing severe punishments for that criminal activity. :However, according to top elections officials from both political parties in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Nevada, there were no widespread voting irregularities, nor any major instances of fraud or illegal activity in the 2020 presidential election, The Associated Press reported. Here's what's key: No elections expert doubts voter fraud exists in U.S. elections, including cases where people who aren't eligible to vote try to cast ballots. Typically, as reported by The Associated Press, the crime happens when people wanting to honor the wishes of loved ones who recently died illegally fill out ballots for the deceased. But all instances of voter fraud taken together are extremely minuscule in comparison to the number of ballots cast, and do not change the outcome of an election.In sum, since no evidence existed to show local elections were nefariously counting fraudulent ballots under directives from Biden, his campaign, or the Democratic Party in the 2020 presidential election, we rate this claim ""false."":"
19,19,19,700.OregonRefugeStandoff,"David Fry was the last of the remaining four occupiers of Oregon's Malheur Refuge to surrender peacefully to FBI agents Thursday morning, ending a standoff that has now stretched well into its second month.  Fry stayed on a livestream for several hours after the rest of his fellow occupiers had surrendered, threatening alternately to shoot himself and others before finally turning himself in.""It has never been the FBI's desire to engage these armed occupiers in any way other than through dialogue, and to that end, the FBI has negotiated with patience and restraint in an effort to resolve the situation peacefully,"" said Greg Bretzing, Oregon FBI Special Agent in Charge, in a statement:However, we reached a point where it became necessary to take action in a way that best ensured the safety of those on the refuge, the law enforcement officers who are on scene, and the people of Harney County who live and work in this area.The four who remained (Sean Anderson and his wife Sandy Anderson, David Fry, and Jeff Banta) said they had been camping out rather than stay in the federal building at the refuge. An bizarre, hours-long livestream from their campsite ended as a wide-ranging, conversation (peppered with conspiracy theories about everything from Common Core to Black Hawk helicopters) between the four and Nevada State Assemblywoman Michele Fiore, who seemed to be acting as a mediator.:The four were indicted in absentia, along with twelve who had already been arrested. They all face federal felony charges of conspiracy to impede officers, which broadly covers all the events and activities since they took over the refuge.Armed militia members, led by Ammon Bundy, entered the wildlife refuge on 2 January 2016, saying they were protesting federal government overreach. On 26 January, the standoff escalated into violence that ended with police shooting LaVoy Finicum, who was acting as the unofficial spokesman for the armed occupation.Cliven Bundy, the Nevada rancher (and father of Ammon Bundy) who gained notoriety in 2014 in his own armed standoff against the Bureau of Land Management over the federal government trying to push his cattle out of federally protected land, traveled to Oregon to support the occupiers. He was arrested at the Portland airport late Wednesday."
20,20,20,69.5GConspiracyTheories,"This article is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.As the coronavirus pandemic has gathered momentum, so too have explanations for how the outbreak started and what is causing its spread. Among these explanations is a theory that the recent rollout of 5G technology is to blame. Many countries are witnessing increased numbers of groups warning others about the dangers of 5G. In the UK, Australia and the US, activists believe that 5G is the real cause of the pandemic, and that disrupting the 5G network is necessary to halt the spread of the virus. At the extreme end of these groups are those who warn that COVID-19 is a hoax, a cover-story for more evil plans, of which 5G is a crucial part.Why do people believe conspiracy theories, and what accounts for the ongoing surge in their popularity? At the root of these beliefs is a contemporary spirit of distrust towards governments and health organisations. Moreover, people are particularly drawn to these alternative explanations during times of crisis.:Truth seekersMany conspiracy theorists identify themselves as ""truth seekers"". They are often part of a wider movement of people that consider themselves to be free thinkers who are courageous enough to seek the truth, and to speak up. They act like heroic detectives, revealing what they see as powerful groups operating in secrecy to achieve malevolent outcomes.Most conspiracy theories view these powerful groups as working in the shadows, inaccessible and behind the scenes. But the 5G-coronavirus theory departs from this template in one crucial way: the source of evil is visible and accessible to anyone who believes in these ideas.Unlike shadowy cabals and occult forces, the 5G-coronavirus conspiracy can be challenged directly. The 5G network is composed of material infrastructures that are easy to identify and access. For those who believe they know the truth, acts of vandalism against phone masts and antennas represent the possibility to exert some control over troubling events.:Conspiracies at a time of crisisPeople want to simplify and make sense of complex and unprecedented situations. As a means to understand this pandemic, there exist both official and conspiracy theories. The official truth is simple: COVID-19 was transferred to humans from animals, similar to previous coronavirus outbreaks. It is primarily spread through droplets generated when an infected person sneezes or coughs.The popularity of theories that link 5G to the outbreak, however, expose the levels of distrust towards scientific claims, truth and expert explanations of events. Although anti-5G theories have been around for some time, these explanations are currently winning new supporters. This is in part due to a lack of confidence in governments, many of which have struggled to manage this crisis, and now face questions as to whether they acted too early or too late.More concerning is how right-wing populism thrives in and intensifies this climate of distrust. All over the world, populist figures advance a polarising worldview that pits corrupt political, corporate and scientific elites against an enlightened community of ""common people"". Donald Trump, Matteo Salvini, Jair Bolsonaro and Nigel Farage garner support by framing their struggle as one of the good leader against bad institutions.:This worldview simultaneously undermines ""the establishment"", and legitimises conspiracy theorists' distrust. The implications of this are troubling. Distinctions between scientific truths and conspiracy theories have become blurred at the highest levels of government. Unproven solutions to control diseases are favoured over evidence-based interventions. Moreover, there is a growing resistance to vaccination in countries where political populism is on the rise. Policy interventions designed to solve problems are instead seen as part of the problem.An infodemicThese considerations become even more important at a time when lockdown measures have led to people spending increased time on social media. In part, the internet enables those previously on the fringes of popular opinion to find and communicate with like-minded others. And while confidence in traditional institutions wanes, any number of alternative explanations resonate among friends in online groups. :As people try to understand the pandemic and make sense of their changed lives, celebrity YouTube ""truth seekers"" are receiving unprecedented levels of attention. Although Facebook newsfeeds are littered with state-sanctioned public health advice, private groups are awash with bogus claims and misinformation that contradicts the official knowledge and political processes. The World Health Organization has declared this situation to be an ""infodemic"". Pressure is now mounting on social media companies to restrict the flow of misinformation. Yet, within the truth seeker community, attempts by Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp to intervene are interpreted as further evidence that powerful institutions and elites are conspiring to conceal the ""real truth"".Events such as the attacks on 5G masts offer a barometer to measure levels of trust in leadership and expertise. The challenge for governments and the media will be to demonstrate renewed levels of openness and solidarity to restore public trust, rather than fuelling this appetite for alternative truths.:Tim Hill, Lecturer in Marketing, University of Bath; Robin Canniford, Co-director Cluster For Organization, Society and Markets, University of Melbourne, and Stephen Murphy, Lecturer in Marketing, University of EssexThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

21,21,21,135.NoPfizerDoesNotOwnNe,"Claim:As of January and February 2022, Pfizer owned Neil Young's song catalog or held sway over him and dictated his views on COVID-19 vaccination.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In early 2022, folk-rock legend Neil Young found himself the target of a laughable conspiracy theory after he spoke out against COVID-19-related misinformation. On Jan. 24, Young wrote that he wanted his music removed from the streaming platform Spotify, unless the company ended its agreement to host Joe Rogan's podcast, which has on several occasions provided a forum for potentially harmful misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. In response, Spotify removed Young's back catalog from its library, rather than cutting ties with Rogan. :In the midst of that controversy, vaccine skeptics and COVID-19 conspiracy theorists shared a ludicrous conspiracy theory claiming that the pharmaceutical company Pfizer -- which produces a widely-used COVID-19 vaccine -- either owned the rights to Young's music catalog or, through a chain of connections, held sway over the rock star and influenced, or even ordered, his pro-vaccination stance. For example, some social media users posted a meme with the text, ""When you realize Neil Young's music catalogue is owned by Pfizer""::Others did not explicitly claim that Pfizer itself owned some or all of Young's catalog, but did suggest that the company held sway over him, by way of a series of connections, and that therefore Young's opposition to Rogan and his criticism of vaccine misinformation should be dismissed as the result of corruption and self-compromise, rather than a principled stance. On social media, a conspiracy theorist who uses the moniker An0maly outlined the theory in helpful detail, starting with the observation that in January 2021, Young reportedly sold half of his catalog to a U.K.-based investment fund called Hipgnosis, for around $150 million. An0maly continued:So, 50% to UK investment fund Hipgnosis. In October of 2021, Blackstone and Hipgnosis Song Management launched [a] ""$1 billion partnership to invest in songs, recorded music, music IP and royalties."" Interesting. Blackstone is ""an American alternative investment management company"" who, interestingly enough, in 2020 announced the appointment of ""Jeffrey B. Kindler, former chairman and CEO of Pfizer, as [a] senior adviser.""Now I don't know the answer to this, but did Neil Young independently make the decision to try and blackball Joe Rogan for questioning big pharma and the government narrative? Or was it a team decision with a multi-billion-dollar investment firm who also owns a big chunk of his music?:The first point to note here is that, even among those promulgating the Young-Pfizer theory, it is not seriously suggested that Pfizer itself -- which is, after all, a pharmaceutical company -- owns the rights to any of Young's music. That claim can be dismissed. Before assessing the logic behind the theory, and its coherence, it's worth briefly evaluating the accuracy of each of its components. First, it appears to be true that, in January 2021, Young sold half of his songs to Hipgnosis. In a news release, Hipgnosis wrote: ""...The Company has acquired 50% of Neil Young's worldwide copyright and income interests in his entire song catalogue comprising 1,180 songs.""Secondly, it is also true that in October 2021, Blackstone bought an ownership stake in Hipgnosis, as demonstrated in news releases published by both companies. Finally, it is also true that in August 2020, Blackstone hired Jeff Kindler as a senior advisor, and that Kindler used to be the chairman and CEO of Pfizer. :However, rather than having uncovered a web of corruption, those pushing the Young-Pfizer story were engaging in the classic conspiracy theorist's fallacy of finding whatever possible connection they can between two separate entities (in this case, Young and Pfizer) without first testing the logical or chronological basis of that putative link. In other words, ""connecting the dots"" by whatever means available, rather than uncovering an actual, organic conspiracy. Let's look at the sequence of events. Kindler left Pfizer in 2010 -- a full decade before he joined Blackstone, and before the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted Pfizer to develop a vaccine along with its German partner BioNTech.Blackstone is a publicly traded company, meaning it has a fiduciary duty to its shareholders, and Kindler, in turn, has a professional obligation to provide sound business and strategic advice to Blackstone. Aside from presenting no concrete evidence whatsoever, those pushing the Young-Pfizer conspiracy theory appear to be asking readers to believe, despite these circumstances, one of two explanations::That Kindler set aside his obligations to Blackstone and managed to persuade the company to engage in a billion-dollar investment venture with Hipgnosis, specifically so that they could acquire some influence over the licensing of Young's music and then leverage that against Rogan's vaccine skepticism on Spotify, for the benefit of Pfizer, a completely separate company, which Kindler had left a decade earlier; orThat access to half of Young's catalog was a ""happy accident"" of the Blackstone-Hipgnosis deal but that, with the connivance of Young himself, Kindler sought to leverage that access against Rogan and Spotify, all for the benefit of Pfizer, a completely separate company, which Kindler had left a decade earlier. As outlandish as these scenarios are, they are premised on even shakier assumptions: for example, that Kindler was even consulted on the Blackstone-Hipgnosis deal; or that if he was, he was in favor of it; and that Young has any remaining financial or commercial obligations to Hipgnosis and/or Blackstone after the sale of half his music -- after all, if that deal is already done, what is the supposed basis of Hipgnosis or Blackstone's putative leverage over Young?:It's not necessary to list, in excruciating detail, each of the known factual and logical flaws associated with the Young-Pfizer conspiracy theory. The claim that the pharmaceutical company ""owned Young's music catalog"" was patently false, and the theory of a fantastical web of corruption, with Kindler at its centre, was presented without any concrete evidence and, perhaps more importantly, made no sense whatsoever.

Rating:FalseAbout this rating In December 2021, a video was circulated on social media that supposedly showed a young child surreptitiously handing U.S. President Joe Biden what appears to be a vial of blood. The @projectpelosi Twitter account falsely claimed that Biden received this ""vial of fresh blood"" so that he could drink it on his way back to the White House.::This Twitter account has since been suspended. Copies of the ""fresh blood"" video have since been reposted by other accounts and occasionally turn up on YouTube: This is a doctored video spreading conspiratorial nonsense. :A segment of the QAnon conspiracy theory holds that there is a cabal of politicians who engage in so-called satanic behavior, such as drinking the blood of children. There is no evidence to support this conspiracy theory. In fact, the vast majority of such claims are based on demonstrably inaccurate and false information. We took a deeper look at the false claim that Democrats drink the blood of children previously.The above-displayed video, for example, is doctored. The child in this video is not actually holding a vial of blood. Someone digitally inserted a vial of blood into this video in order to spread the nonsensical rumor that Biden drinks blood.The original video was taken in July 2021 as Biden stepped off Air Force One at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport where he was greeted by Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and his family. While no blood vials were exchanged in the original unaltered footage, Biden does appear to hand something to Beshear's son.

23,23,23,18.ConspiracyTheoryAbou,"The 31 March 2019 murder of hip hop artist and community advocate Nipsey Hussle in Los Angeles has prompted some netizens to drudge up a baseless conspiracy theory about holistic doctor deaths and insinuate the rapper was assassinated as part of a wide-ranging cover-up plot sanctioned by the pharmaceutical, medical, and regulatory agencies.Grammy award-nominated rapper Hussle (born Ermias Joseph Asghedom) was shot and killed while standing outside Marathon Clothing, a business he co-owned in South L.A. Police arrested 29-year-old Eric Holder on suspicion of committing what they believed to be a murder motivated by a personal dispute. (Holder has pleaded not guilty.)Before his untimely death, the 33-year-old artist announced he was working on a documentary film about alternative health guru and traditional healer Alfredo Bowman, also known as Dr. Sebi, who died in 2016 from pneumonia while in custody of Honduran authorities after being arrested on money-laundering charges. Sebi was 82 at the time of his death.:Hussle's killing appears to be totally unrelated to his work on the documentary film about Dr. Sebi. At a 2 April 2019 press conference, Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said that Hussle and the suspect knew each other, and that ""we believe this to be a dispute between Mr. Hussle and Mr. Holder. I'm not going to go into the conversations but it appears to be a personal matter between the two of them in regards to a dispute, and I'll leave it at that.""Moore said the suspect approached Hussle, who was standing outside the clothing store with two other people, and exchanged words. He returned multiple times before opening fire, injuring the other persons while fatally wounding Hussle.Deaths of holistic doctors and anything tangentially related to them have become fodder for a wide-ranging conspiracy theory that contends a plot is afoot to silence them before their unconventional cures kneecap the pharmaceutical industry. Hussle's work on the documentary about Sebi thus served as a segue for the conspiracy-minded to link the two events without evidence:This isn't a coincidence! Nipsey Hussle was working on a documentary that will narrate Dr. Sebi's Trial in 1985. Dr. Sebi claimed that he could cure AIDS & was allegedly executed by way of U.S. Medical Corporations because his AIDS remedy would take away from their own profits. pic.twitter.com/rqrvaeSbAi-- Jared Sawyer Jr. (@JaredSawyerJr) April 1, 2019:As we reported in 2017, this conspiracy theory was largely the brainchild of Erin Elizabeth, who runs the holistic blog Health Nut News. Elizabeth began cataloguing holistic doctor deaths in 2015 and keeping a running tab on them. In the wake of Hussle's murder, Elizabeth updated her post about the holistic doctor deaths with the following statement:Note from Erin: I know many of you are here because Nipsey Hussle, may he rest in peace, was gunned down in broad daylight in Los Angeles at the age of 33. He was making a documentary, which he talked about a lot, about Dr. Sebi who is on our list. He also talked about our holistic doctor death series publicly. Months ago, I signed a contract with Entertainment One in Los Angeles to do a documentary series as well, on the doctors and it would feature Dr. Sebi. I vow that no matter what, this documentary will be made.But as we also reported in 2017, a list of deaths does not itself a conspiracy make. The vast majority of the deaths Elizabeth has chronicled are demonstrably unrelated to each other and have already been explained as accidents, homicides not tied to any medical conspiracy, and natural causes. Sebi, for example, was an elderly person already suffering from a serious medical condition (pneumonia) when he was incarcerated in Honduras, where conditions for prisoners are notoriously harsh.:Some conspiracy buffs even looped the 2002 death of another prominent artist, TLC vocalist Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes, into the conspiracy, claiming the connection was relevant because Lopes died in Honduras on her way to see Sebi. Lopes's death, however, was also unrelated to Sebi's or Hussle's.It's true, coincidentally, that Lopes was vacationing in Honduras and was a client of Sebi's, but foul play was not suspected in her death. Lopes was killed in an auto accident in which she was thrown from the vehicle she was driving after attempting to pass a car in her lane, swerving to avoid an oncoming truck, and subsequently crashing into two trees and rolling the vehicle several times, thereby suffering a massive head injury. Little mystery surrounds her death, as the accident was captured by a photographer who was riding in the car with her.Hussle was a renowned community activist who was known for his efforts to help improve the quality of life and invigorate the Crenshaw neighborhood in which he grew up, as Los Angeles Magazine stated:Apart from a career in music that included a slew of well-received mixtapes and collaborations with artists including Drake and Snoop Dogg, Hussle was considered a pillar of the Crenshaw community. He'd recently announced he was launching a STEM education center and co-working space called Vector 90 along with real estate Dave Gross, with whom he was also working on a residential complex on the site of the plaza where Marathon currently stands. Last year, he signed on as a community partner in District 8 City Councilman Marqueece Harris-Dawson's Destination Crenshaw project, a mile-long outdoor museum that will run along the Metro Crenshaw Line.:Hussle was praised by city leaders for his efforts, with L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti observing at a 2 April 2019 press conference that Hussle was a ""tireless advocate for the young people of this city and of this world, to lift them up with the possibility of not being imprisoned by where you come from or past mistakes, but the possibility of what comes in the future."""
24,24,24,121.NoObamaDidntTweetThi,"Claim:Former U.S. President Barack Obama wrote a tweet asking if anyone checked whether his successor, Donald Trump, was born in Russia.Rating:FalseAbout this rating A fake tweet mocked up to look like it was written by former U.S. President Barack Obama went viral, likely because if it were real, it would have represented quite a clap back.The image, posted on March 31, 2022, is a screenshot of what looks like Obama's verified Twitter account and a tweet that states, ""I think most Americans would agree that I'm a level-headed individual, not a man who's prone to indulging in conspiracy theories. I've certainly had a fair number directed at me. But has anyone checked to make sure Donald Trump doesn't have a Russian birth certificate?""::The fake tweet is a play on the ""birther"" conspiracy theory, of which Obama's successor, former U.S. President Donald Trump, was a major proponent before he took office. Birtherism is a racist conspiracy theory that falsely posits Obama, the first Black president, wasn't born in the U.S.The tweet also plays on news stories that took off after Trump took office, reporting the latter's campaign had received help from the Russian government. When Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Trump referred to Russian President Vladimir Putin's military strategy as ""genius.""The Obama tweet doesn't appear on his Twitter timeline, nor does it appear on PolitiWoops, a database of deleted tweets by political figures operated by the non-profit news organization ProPublica."

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.The ""anti-lockdown"" and #Reopen protests in the U.S. have powerful and secretive backers, but there are real Americans on the streets expressing their opinions. As an ethnographer - someone who studies cultural participation - I'm interested in who those Americans are, and why they're upset. I spent the last week in what you might call an online road trip, studying 30 posts of protest footage from events in 15 cities. I found some shared themes, which don't fit well with popular narratives about these protests.:   1. Poverty is taboo, but work is 'essential'Despite the economic toll the lockdowns are taking on America's poor, no protesters put their own poverty on display, such as posting signs asking for help.Instead, they held signs with more general language, like ""Poverty Kills,"" or expressed concerns like the restaurateur in Phoenix, Arizona, who told a passing videographer he was worried about his 121 ""suffering, devastated"" employees.Their messages made clear that they didn't want to ask for a handout or charity - but they were asking to be allowed to work. Protesters across many states asserted their work - or even all work - was ""essential.""In one video from an ""Operation Gridlock"" protest in Lansing, Michigan, where activists planned to block traffic, a protester filmed out the window of his car when he drove past a sign saying ""Give me work not money."" The protester himself called out in approval, ""Give me work not money, I hear that!"":A young man at an Olympia, Washington, event described work as a source not only of money but identity: ""I wanna go back to work! That pride that you feel every day when you go home from work? That's like nothing that can ... be taken.""Protest signs in Denver, Colorado, included the plaintive ""I want my career back"" and the entrepreneurial ""Dogs Need Groomers."" :Outside the Missouri Capitol on April 21, some protesters wore masks - though others didn't.AP Photo/Jeff Roberson2. The threat of the virus is seriousDespite alarming news reports that protesters were ignoring social distancing, many of the protesters observed safety guidelines. Photos showed at least some people wearing masks. A TikTok video recruiting participants for Michigan's Operation Gridlock encouraged protesters to be safe; drone footage shows that most participants at the state capitol stayed in their cars, away from other people.Protesters' signs didn't really downplay the threat of the virus, but rather compared it with potential harm from the lockdown. For instance, a sign in Denver was headed ""Trading Lives"" and featured a scale with virus deaths on one side, with unemployment, suicide and homelessness on the other.:   3. Anti-science displays are on the fringeThere were protesters at several rallies who wore anti-vaccination T-shirts and held signs suggesting they don't trust public health experts and scientists. But only one protest was dominated by that theme. At that one, on April 18 in Austin, Texas, hundreds of attendees chanted ""Fire Fauci!"" referring to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who has been a frequent public face of the federal government's efforts to fight the virus. That was also the rally where right-wing radio host Alex Jones, who runs a conspiracy-theory website, drove around in a truck egging on attendees' chants through a megaphone.At the other events, it appeared protesters had been expecting higher numbers of infections than actually happened. Rather than seeing that as evidence of the success of social distancing, they seemed to interpret this as saying the science was no longer valid. ""The models were wrong"" was on more than one sign, suggesting protesters had paid attention to the scientific models at first but had come to believe the disease's seriousness had been exaggerated.:   4. People want to fight the virus in familiar waysEven when protesters acknowledged the threat of the virus, few of them were calling for medical experts to provide the solution. I saw none of the demonstrators calling for more widespread testing, for instance. :When they did express concern, protest signs coupled it with a desire to fight the contagion. In Boise, Idaho, one sign read ""Freedom over Fear."" In Denver, one said ""Don't let your mask be your muzzle.""However, the protesters wanted to fight the virus in ways that were more familiar to them and, perhaps, more empowering: In Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, a giant green truck had ""Jesus is my vaccine"" scrawled on its side. Some protesters demanded governments allow people to make their own decisions, and even displayed the pro-choice slogan ""My Body My Choice."" Others showed up with guns. One man in Frankfort, Kentucky, blew a shofar, a Jewish religious instrument made from a ram's horn blown at the start of a battle.:Armed protesters were among the crowd in Michigan on April 30.Jeff Kowalsky/AFP via Getty Images   5. 'Tyranny' depends on who governs, not howIn many of the events across different states, protesters objected to what they called ""tyranny,"" and held up the Revolution-era ""Don't Tread On Me"" Gadsden flag to symbolize their resistance to government rules. They were not objecting to President Donald Trump's April 13 declaration that, as president, his ""authority is total"" over the nation.Instead they were objecting to governors' lockdown rules, which they highlighted as overreaching their power. Many protesters likened the government's behavior to Nazis, with protesters adding ""Heil"" before Democratic governors' names.No male governor was targeted as viciously and overtly as female Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. A widely circulated poster depicted her dressed as Adolf Hitler, giving a Nazi salute beside a swastika. Other demonstrators talked about Whitmer as though she were mothering them instead of governing them, like one who insisted, ""We're not her children!"":   6. Race is a factorOne clearly visible theme in the #Reopen protests is how white the attendees are - but not just in terms of their own race. Their compassion also seemed limited to fellow white people. None that I saw were calling attention to the fact that the coronavirus doesn't hit all populations equally: Blacks and other racial minorities had less access to high-quality health care before the outbreak, and as a result are less healthy and less able to fight off the virus when it strikes.:There was overt racism toward the Chinese, too, echoing words of the president and other political leaders, as on the Jefferson City, Missouri, sign that read ""Tyranny is spreading faster than the China virus.""    :7. Divided and distanced, is it a movement?Most protesters did not refer to these protests as a movement. I found just one video offering a vision that they could form one. In that livestream from Operation Gridlock, at one point the videographer shouted, ""'merica!"" Then, his unseen companion replied in a meditative tone about the potential he saw on that road: ""Together we're strong, divided we're weak. That's the establishment's biggest fear, for the people to get together and not be divided. ... That's what they fear the most. Because we have the power."" It was not clear if those people with the power included the much greater number of people across America who were sheltered in place.Diana Daly, Assistant Professor of Information, University of ArizonaThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Council passed a law specific to Washington, D.C., in late December 2020 that allows children as young as 11 to receive vaccines if they are deemed capable by a doctor of giving informed consent.What's FalseNo nationwide U.S. law allows children as young as 11 to get vaccinated without the consent of their parents, although some states allow minors to get some vaccines if their parents are opposed.:In late December 2020, readers asked Snopes for verification of online rumors stating that a law went into effect recently allowing children to get vaccinated without the consent of their parents.Some of the posts shared screenshots from a website, Conservative Brief, which misleadingly included a picture of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. Fauci has been at the forefront of the U.S. response to the COVID-19 pandemic.:The meme led some readers to believe that a new nationwide law allows children 11 and older to get vaccinated without their parents' knowledge or consent. One reader inquired, ""Did The US just pass legislation that children can get the Covid vaccine without parental consent?""The answer is no.One such law did pass at the local level, in Washington, D.C., but had nothing to do with Fauci. According to the website for the D.C. Council, the law went into effect on Dec. 23, 2020.It allows children as young as 11 in Washington, D.C., to get vaccines against a range of illnesses like polio, measles, mumps and rubella, as well as the COVID-19 coronavirus and human papillomavirus, if a doctor determines they are capable of giving informed consent. The vaccination record would be sent to the child's school, not to their parents, if the parents are using a religious exemption that allows their child to attend school without vaccines against communicable diseases.The bill was originally introduced to the D.C. Council in early 2019 in response to an outbreak of measles. The intent was to circumvent parents who subscribe to anti-vaccine conspiracy theories and refuse to vaccinate their children, enabling such outbreaks.:Some of these children, like Ethan Lindenberger, have gotten themselves vaccinated against their parents' wishes and become public health advocates, and some states let teens get vaccines without parental consent.In the face of the anti-vaccine conspiracy movement, some advocate for expanding the practice of letting children of a certain age decide for themselves whether to get vaccinated without their parents' knowledge. However, no nationwide law exists that allows children as young as 11 to receive a vaccine without parental consent."
27,27,27,243.ChildhoodVaccination,"Claim:   Studies have shown that children who are vaccinated are 85% more likely to inject heroin than those who are not. FALSEExample: [Collected via Facebook, March 2015] Origins:   In July 2013, the Something Awful humor web site'sPhotoshop Phriday section (a showcase for ""the tremendous image manipulation talents of the Something Awful Forum Goons"") entreated participants to create fictitious advertising posters in furtherance of that week's theme of ""Anti-Vaccine Ads and Anti-Anti-Vaccine Ads!"":  We all have one of ""those"" friends who is always posting conspiracy theory and anti-vaccination pictures or articles on Facebook. I usually read them for a laugh and follow their citations which usually lead to another part of the same site.If they can take anti-vaccination posters to this level of absurdity, imagine what we can do!: One of the fake s created for that amusement was intended to skewer the anti-vaccination movement by asserting that ""children who are vaccinated are 85% more likely to inject heroin than those who are not"" because""vaccinations leave a lasting psychological belief that injecting is beneficial,"" but the image quickly began spreading across the internet removed from its original context.  The mistaken propagation of this faux ad as something containing valid information was heightened when the group Feminists Against Vaccinations posted it to their Facebook page on 8 March 2015.  Despite the fact that the image still contained a watermark from SomethingAwful.com and the 1-800 number listed at the bottom of the ad was a few digits short of authenticity, many viewers believed that the posted illustrated a scarily real statistic linking heroin use to childhood vaccinations. But according to Sunshine Coast Local Medical Association president Dr Di Minuskin, this viral meme is ""outrageously incorrect"":""I am horrified that this type of message should gain any validity,"" Dr Minuskin said. ""If anyone receives this image via social media I would recommend they swiftly assign it to the trash box where it belongs. Not only is the information outrageously incorrect, it is irresponsible to be creating unwarranted fear about such an important issue."": Last updated:   23 March 2015"
28,28,28,578.HowHolocaustDenialWo,"The Holocaust happened.It is a fact that some six million European Jews were systematically murdered by Nazi Germany and its collaborators between 1941 and 1945 in a state-sponsored program of genocide.The National Socialists came to power in part by convincing Germans that many of the country's problems were caused by its Jewish minority, whom they labeled an ""inferior race"" and depicted as depraved and animal-like in anti-Semitic propaganda. Their implementation of a plan to exterminate the Jews -- the ""Final Solution,"" they called it -- has been well documented, starting with the 3,000 tons of confiscated Third Reich paperwork presented in evidence at the Nuremberg trials immediately after the war.Yet, despite universal agreement among historians about all of the above (""No serious historian questions that the Holocaust took place,"" the American Historical Association affirmed in a 1991 statement), there exists a tiny but vocal group of naysayers -- conspiracy theorists, actually, given that they claim that ""Jewish-controlled"" academic and media institutions ""invented"" the Holocaust -- whose mission it is to sow doubt that the genocide of European Jews ever happened. They are known (to everyone but themselves) as Holocaust deniers.:Here are some basic tenets of Holocaust denialism (via the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum):""Holocaust denial"" describes attempts to negate the established facts of the Nazi genocide of European Jewry. Common denial assertions are: that the murder of six million Jews during World War II never occurred; that the Nazis had no official policy or intention to exterminate the Jews; and that the poison gas chambers in Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp never existed.A newer trend is the distortion of the facts of the Holocaust. Common distortions include, for example, assertions that: the figure of six million Jewish deaths is an exaggeration; deaths in the concentration camps were the results of disease or starvation but not policy; and that the diary of Anne Frank is a forgery.The deniers aren't known for their subtlety. ""I don't see any reason to be tasteful about Auschwitz,"" said author, anti-Semite, and Holocaust denier David Irving in 1991. He continued:It's baloney, it's a legend. Once we admit the fact that it was a brutal slave labor camp and large numbers of people did die, as large numbers of innocent people died elsewhere in the War, why believe the rest of the baloney?I say quite tastelessly, in fact, that more women died on the back seat of Edward Kennedy's car at Chappaquiddick than ever died in a gas chamber in Auschwitz.:At a 2006 conference of Holocaust deniers in Iran hosted by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the country's former interior minister said, without irony, ""All the studies and research carried out so far have proven that there is no reason to believe that the Holocaust ever occurred and that it is only a tale.""Others at the conference admitted the killings took place, but claimed the numbers were inflated: Frederick Toben, an Australian who in 1999 served jail time in Germany for his Holocaust views, told the conference in no uncertain terms that the number of Jews killed in Nazi death camps -- an estimated 6 million -- is a myth.''The number of victims at the Auschwitz concentration camp could be about 2,007,'' Toben said. ''The railroad to the camp did not have enough capacity to transfer large numbers of Jews.""Don't mistake these for sincere historical quibbles. They are direct misstatements of the evidentiary record -- a record whose existence, again, we owe in large part to the Nazis themselves.:""Extermination, we're doing it""Both propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and SS chief Heinrich Himmler, for example, admitted there was an official plan to exterminate the Jewish population. ""The Jews have deserved the catastrophe that has now overtaken them,"" Goebbels wrote in his diary in 1942. ""Not much will remain of the Jews. On the whole it can be said that about 60 percent of them will have to be liquidated whereas only 40 percent can be used for forced labor.""Chillingly, Himmler said this in a 1943 speech in Posen, Poland:I refer now to the evacuation of the Jews, the extermination of the Jewish people. This is one of those things that is easily said: ""the Jewish people are being exterminated,"" says every Party member, ""quite true, it's part of our plans, the elimination of the Jews, extermination, we're doing it.""No one left behind a ledger sheet tallying the precise number of Jews ""exterminated"" but that doesn't mean the figure can't be accurately estimated based on existing evidence such as census reports and other government records that survived Nazi efforts to destroy them at the end of the war::No personnel were available or inclined to count Jewish deaths until the very end of World War II and the Nazi regime. Hence, total estimates are calculated only after the end of the war and are based on demographic loss data and the documents of the perpetrators. Though fragmentary, these sources provide essential figures from which to make calculations. Rooted in anti-SemitismSome Holocaust deniers are self-styled ""historical revisionists"" -- meaning they present themselves as earnest re-interpreters of real historical data whose goal is simply to reveal the whole truth -- but it's a misnomer. Scratch the surface of your typical Holocaust denier and you will find an anti-Semite. The notion, widespread among deniers, that Jews ""invented"" or ""exaggerated"" the Holocaust to further their own interests hearkens back to a centuries-old conspiracy theory positing a secret ""cabal"" of wealthy Jewish bankers seeking absolute world domination.""The Holocaust is the device used as the pillar of Zionist imperialism, Zionist aggression, Zionist terror and Zionist murder,"" former Ku Klux Klan Imperial Wizard David Duke has said (while dismissing the claim that the Nazis used gas chambers to kill Jews as a ""myth"").:In 2013, England's most infamous Holocaust denier, David Irving (quoted above saying more people died in Ted Kennedy's car than at Auschwitz), was asked if it weren't true that Jews ""run the world"":Irving, who strongly denies being anti-semitic, replies: ""Well sometimes people stand up and fight back.""He says Jews in America control all media, banks and that ""they dare not appoint any leading person in the White House to ministerial positions involving money without him being a Jew. Look where that got them in Germany in 1933. And they will not learn the lesson, they all think it won't happen again.""Then they ask why they are so hated.""...Irving says he hears people say Jews are hated because they crucified Jesus Christ. ""I say if you walk into a pub in Wapping and ask people why they don't like the Jews they don't mention Jesus. They mention other reasons. They're worried about their mortgages and the banks ... that's the reason why the Jews get hated."":It's telling that Irving denies hating Jews while repeatedly observing that ""Jews are hated,"" then blames them for it.The rise of ""soft denialism""There is a relatively new form of Holocaust denialism -- dubbed ""soft denialism"" because its adherents don't deny the Holocaust outright but attempt to trivialize it instead -- whose rise seems to have followed the same curve as that of right-wing nationalist movements worldwide in recent years.The most prevalent form of soft denialism revolves around the claim that the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany is given preferential treatment over the persecution of other minority groups by the same regime. But this is a moral deflection. It's a fact that the Reich persecuted and killed millions of others in the name of ""Aryan superiority"" -- Roma (""gypsies""), Serbs, Poles, individuals with disabilities, individuals perceived as ""homosexual,"" socialists, communists, and Jehovah's Witnesses, to name only some of the targeted minorities -- but this is no justification for eliding Hitler's decades-long vendetta against the Jewish people in particular, a vendetta which very nearly ended in their complete eradication. :In January 2017, President Trump was roundly criticized for issuing a statement ""in the name of the perished"" on Holocaust Remembrance Day, held on the anniversary of the 1945 liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, that never once mentioned the Jewish victims of that tragedy:January 27, 2017Statement by the President on International Holocaust Remembrance Day""It is with a heavy heart and somber mind that we remember and honor the victims, survivors, heroes of the Holocaust. It is impossible to fully fathom the depravity and horror inflicted on innocent people by Nazi terror.""Yet, we know that in the darkest hours of humanity, light shines the brightest. As we remember those who died, we are deeply grateful to those who risked their lives to save the innocent.""In the name of the perished, I pledge to do everything in my power throughout my Presidency, and my life, to ensure that the forces of evil never again defeat the powers of good. Together, we will make love and tolerance prevalent throughout the world."":Harsh reactions to Trump's statement came from many quarters.""This is not a political issue, this is a matter of not just sensitivity, it's a matter of historical fact,"" said Jonathan Greenblatt of the Anti-Defamation League. ""Six million Jews were slaughtered along with millions of other people. But the Holocaust was about this singular focus on the annihilation of the Jewish people. That's why we remember it. That's why there is a day, a sad day like this past Friday, to reflect upon it.""""The Nazis killed an astonishing number of people in monstrous ways and targeted certain groups -- Gypsies, the mentally challenged, and open homosexuals, among others,"" wrote conservative commentator John Podhoretz. ""But the Final Solution was aimed solely at the Jews. The Holocaust was about the Jews. ... To universalize it to 'all those who suffered' is to scrub the Holocaust of its meaning.""""The lack of a direct statement about the suffering of the Jewish people during the Holocaust was an unfortunate omission,"" said Fred Brown, a spokesperson for the Republican Jewish Coalition. ""History unambiguously shows the purpose of the Nazi's final solution was the extermination of the Jews of Europe. We hope, going forward, he conveys those feelings when speaking about the Holocaust."":The White House dismissed the criticisms, claiming they simply didn't want to leave any of the victims out. ""Despite what the media reports, we are an incredibly inclusive group and we took into account all of those who suffered,"" said spokesperson Hope Hicks.If the Trump administration won't listen to their critics, they ought to at least take note of who applauded them for their Holocaust statement -- the openly anti-Semitic ""alt-right"" leader Richard Spencer, for one, who hailed what he termed President Trump's ""de-Judification of the Holocaust"" in a blog post titled ""Because Hitler."" ""[T]he kvetching came quickly"" (yes, he used the Yiddish word) after Trump's statement was released, noted Spencer, and he was having none of it: Trump's statement on Holocaust Memorial Day is, on the surface, utterly defensible within the current moral paradigm: Hitler is depicted as quintessential evil, with modern society revolving around this dark center. But when viewed from the perspective of Jewish activists, Trump's statement becomes outrageous, as it dethrones Jews from a special position in the universe.:It seems unlikely that ""dethroning Jews"" was precisely what the Trump administration had in mind when they said their intent was ""inclusiveness."" That President Trump's Holocaust statement elicited such a response from an avowed white supremacist ought to give him pause before it comes time to issue the next one. Update: Trump's 2018 Holocaust Remembrance Day statement quite explicitly memorialized the millions of Jews who were persecuted and murdered by the Nazis. ""We have a responsibility to convey the lessons of the Holocaust to future generations,"" he added, ""and together as Americans, we have a moral obligation to combat antisemitism, confront hate, and prevent genocide. We must ensure that the history of the Holocaust remains forever relevant and that no people suffer these tragedies ever again."""
29,29,29,232.WaronChristmas,"Substituting ""Merry Christmas"" with ""Happy Holidays"" in a public context: Is it inclusive or exclusive? Whether it was a xenophobic or anti-Semitic conspiracy theory or a kitchen-table debate, the topic has been going around for so many decades that it is unclear who, if anyone, is actually waging the ""war"" for or against Christmas anymore.But if anyone was going to win this war, it's probably retailers.The National Retail Federation reports that consumer spending on gifts, food, decorations, and other holiday items has been trending upward for several years. And the National Christmas Tree Association reported a 20% increase in real tree purchases in 2018 compared to 2017. Fake tree purchases went up too. Meanwhile, some reports signaled a drop in Americans' charitable giving in 2018.So business built around Christmas doesn't appear wounded. But what of its spirit?:Pew Research Center reported that 9 in 10 Americans say they celebrate Christmas, though less than half celebrate it as a religious holiday (Millennials were least likely). And according to another Pew survey, the percentage of Americans who identify as Christian has trended downward, while ""those who describe their religious identity as atheist, agnostic or 'nothing in particular'"" has risen.And all the while, Mariah Carey's ""All I Want For Christmas Is You"" is the top holiday song year after year on Spotify.Is Christmas something said, something given, or something felt?If more people enjoy Christmas, but not the Nativity, is traditional Christmas threatened?

Since her Senate confirmation hearings in late March 2022, many online have been unearthing her past decisions to scrutinize her career.:""Pizzagate"" was a bizarre conspiracy theory that arose in 2016. It claimed Hillary Clinton and her former campaign chairman, John Podesta, ran a child sex ring in the basement of the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria in Washington, D. C. The theory grew on social media, promoted by Trump supporters and white supremacists, and resulted in a man walking into Comet Ping Pong with a rifle and firing numerous shots in December 2016.No one was injured or killed, but Edgar Maddison Welch, the shooter, pleaded guilty in March 2017 to federal charges of assault with a dangerous weapon and transporting a firearm over state lines.U.S. District Judge Jackson was presiding over the case at the time, and said that Welch's actions had ""literally left psychological wreckage."" She declared that ""the extent of the recklessness in this case is breathtaking."" He was sentenced to four years in prison.During Jackson's confirmation hearings, Republicans drew attention to her past sentencing of sex offenders who distributed images of child sex abuse, repeatedly implying that she had been too lenient.

Here's a video to debunk that: pic.twitter.com/hJsMNSdAsF-- Joey (@_Joey_Wong) February 21, 2018Hogg had visited California in 2017 and witnessed an altercation, about which he made a video blog -- a simple fact that was blown out by conspiracy theorists to mean he already lived in Los Angeles and was part of the entertainment industry. (Hogg did live in California, but relocated with his family to Florida before starting high school; he returns to visit every year, as many people do.) :Nikolas Cruz, 19, a former Marjory Stone Douglas student who used an AR-15 semi-automatic firearm he had reportedly purchased from a gun store to carry out the mass shooting, has since been charged with murder; Parkland students have galvanized a national movement calling for stricter gun legislation. Hogg has been one of the most vocal leaders in what has become known as the ""March For Our Lives.""The students' activism has made them the target of ""hoaxers"" -- deranged Internet users and grifters who spread false information that mass shooting incidents are manufactured by the government to seize guns and hand power to a secret global cabal working to install an authoritarian world government.Such hoaxers have periodically been arrested and jailed for physically stalking and harassing survivors, but despite their outlandish beliefs and apparent moral debasement, they are not exactly the ""fringe."" Far-right web sites and Internet personalities like GatewayPundit.com writer Lucian Wintrich, undeterred by ongoing lawsuits related to previous conspiracy theory-related blunders, have claimed the Parkland students were reading from scripts, while the National Rifle Association said in an official statement in response to a nationwide march on 24 March 2018 that the events were staged by ""Hollywood elites."":"
32,32,32,616.NotheOwnerofWTCBuild,"Claim:The owner of World Trade Center's building 7 ""admitted"" it wasn't brought down by the 9/11 terrorist attack but rather by a controlled demolition. Rating:FalseAbout this rating OriginMore than two decades after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, conspiracy theories about them remain prevalent.:Believers in 9/11 conspiracy theories generally assert the attack that took thousands of lives was not an act of terrorism but rather the work of a cabal of secret global elites, or an inside job perpetrated by the U.S. government.One key element of the conspiracy theories is the seemingly unexpected collapse of building 7, which unlike the Twin Towers, wasn't struck by jetliners::The tragedy that unfolded that day had a dramatic impact on the country. Beyond the near-term shock and emotional trauma inflicted by the attack, it was an inflection point leading to controversial domestic anti-terrorism policies, an era of anti-Muslim hate crimes and bigotry, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- the latter being the longest in U.S. history.Another effect was fueled by ""Loose Change,"" a 2005 viral video that also became fodder for a new era of internet conspiracy theorists. The video promotes the false claim that the towers collapsed as the result of a controlled demolition, as opposed to structural failures resulting from the fires started by jet fuel.That's where the misrepresentation of Larry Silverstein's comments come in.Silverstein was interviewed for the PBS documentary ""America Rebuilds."" But he never said, let alone ""admitted,"" that he had ordered building 7 demolished. He said::I remember getting a call from the fire department commander, telling me that they were not sure they were gonna be able to contain the fire, and I said, ""We've had such terrible loss of life, maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it."" And they made that decision to pull and we watched the building collapse.As the BBC reported, citing misinterpretation of his words, a spokesperson for Silverstein issued a follow-up statement clarifying that by using the phrase ""pull it,"" he was not referencing the building itself but the crew of firefighters inside the building:In the afternoon of September 11, Mr Silverstein spoke to the Fire Department Commander on site at Seven World Trade Centre.The Commander told Mr Silverstein that there were several fire fighters in the building working to contain the fires.Mr Silverstein expressed his view that the most important thing was to protect the safety of those fire fighters, including, if necessary, to have them withdraw from the building.Later in the day, the Fire Commander ordered his fire fighters out of the building and at 5:20pm the building collapsed. No lives were lost at 7 World Trade Centre on September 11, 2001.:In sum, Silverstein never said he had ordered the building demolished. Instead, conspiracy theorists twisted his vague wording in the documentary interview to suit their own agenda. Silverstein later stated that his comments had been mischaracterized and clarified that what he meant by ""pull it"" was the crew of firefighters inside the building, not the building itself.The National Institute of Standards and Technology's investigation concluded that building 7's collapse wasn't caused by a controlled demolition. Debris from the collapsed North Tower started a fire in the building. The fire sprinkler system in the lower floors had failed, allowing the fire to burn out of control, which eventually caused steel support elements to thermally expand. This led to a chain of structural failures that caused the building's collapse."

The story, posted by a blogger who uses the nom de plume Sorcha Faal, claimed the transfer was exposed by a report circulating in the Kremlin::An intriguing Ministry of Finance (MoF) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that elite Western bankers were ""stunned/bewildered"" a few hours ago after the Bank For International Settlements (BIS) registered a $1.8 billion transfer from the Clinton Foundation (CF) to the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) through the ""facilitation/abetment"" of JP Morgan Chase & Company (JPM) -- and for reasons yet to be firmly established. According to this report, the Bank for International Settlements is the world's oldest international financial organization and acts as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial transactions; the Qatar Central Bank is the bank of that Gulf State nations government and their ""bank of banks""; JP Morgan Chase & Company is the United States largest ""megabank""; and the Clinton Foundation is an international criminal money laundering organization whose clients include the Russian mafia.The article linked to a number of news sites and blogs but conveniently failed to link to the alleged Kremlin report that would support its main claim. The lack of proof that such a financial transfer was made hasn't stopped other unscrupulous web sites, such MegynKelly.org (which despite using her name doesn't have anything to do with the Fox News journalist Megyn Kelly) and Liberty Alliance from posting the story as though it were a legitimate news item. :RationalWiki describes Sorcha Faal's blog as an ""eyesore"" that is taken seriously only by its conspiracy theorist audience, and even then only marginally:Sorcha Faal is the alleged author of an ongoing series of ""reports"" published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don't think much of it.Each report resembles a news story in its style but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don't contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish.As we have noted in the past, Sorcha Faal is a notorious poster of false information, but the Internet being what it is, such information gets picked up and spread by unwary readers. Previous yarns created by Faal contain headlines such as ""Russia Names Hillary Clinton as 'Murder Suspect' in Death of Top UFO Researchers."" :"
34,34,34,254.IsChristineBlaseyFor,"Claim:Christine Blasey Ford is closely linked to the CIA, and her sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh are part of a CIA plot.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Dr. Christine Blasey Ford faced a torrent of personal attacks and conspiracy theories in September and October 2018, after she publicly accused federal judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, of sexually assaulting her when they were both high school students in Maryland in the early 1980s.:In late September 2018, a conspiracy theory emerged holding that Blasey Ford was closely linked to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and that her allegations were false and part of a CIA plot to block Kavanaugh's confirmation and disrupt President Trump's agenda.One meme which spread the conspiracy-mongering read as follows:If you believe this woman's story, consider this ...Her grandfather, Nicholas Deak, was a well known CIA agent for decades.Her father Ralph Blasey II ran three CIA-front companies Red Coats Inc., Datawatch, and Admiral Security Systems.And her brother Ralph Blasey II [sic] once worked for the law firm Baker Hostetler which was behind the creation of Fusion GPS and subsequently the dossier used to start the Russian collusion investigation.Get the picture?::Another meme emerged from a tweet and blog post published by conservative radio host Michael Savage on 27 September 2018:WHO IS DR BLASEY FORD?WELL, BESIDES BEING A ""PROFESSOR"" AT THE OFF BRAND UNIVERSITY, SHE ALSO WORKS AT A MAJOR UNIVERSITY DOWN THE STREET FROM PALO ALTO.

FORD DEEPLY TIED TO THE CIA? pic.twitter.com/QcRLchqGGn-- Michael Savage (@ASavageNation) September 27, 2018 The theory that Blasey Ford, in making her allegations against Kavanaugh, is acting on behalf of the CIA or as part of a CIA plot against him has three basic components:Christine Blasey Ford directs Stanford University's CIA undergraduate internship program.Her brother, Ralph Blasey III, once worked for a law firm which shares a building with three CIA-operated companies.Blasey Ford's grandfather was Nicholas Deak, a CIA-linked currency trader and former U.S. intelligence agent.:This theory, and its component strands, were written about and promoted on several non-mainstream web sites during September 2018, including What Does It Mean, the BrassBalls blog, ZeroHedge, Before It's News, and in a segment on Alex Jones' InfoWars show (in which Jones claimed Blasey Ford and her family were part of the ""leftist arm of the CIA,"" whose function is ""to create transgender children,"" among other pronouncements).On 17 September, WhatDoesItMean.com's ""Sorcha Faal"" outlined this somewhat complicated web of claims:An intriguing in-depth new Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today states that a Stanford University Psychiatry Professor named Dr. Christine Blasey has become the latest centerpiece of a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) plot to harm President Trump with her last-minute allegation, just days prior to US Senate confirmation, that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had attempted to sexually assault her over 30 years ago when they were teenage school children -- while being kept from the American people about Dr. Blasey is that she currently oversees the CIA Undergraduate Internship Program Stanford University developed by the notorious CIA-connected Stanford University Psychiatric Professor Dr. Frederick T. Melges -- who himself, in 1985, took into his care the homeless woman Lois Lang who assassinated CIA paymaster Nick Deak -- and that afterwards saw the CIA's black operations monies being controlled by Ralph G. Blasey Jr. -- who, not so mysteriously, just happens to be the father of Dr. Christine Blasey.:WhatDoesItMean.com has a long history of fabricating evidence, quotations, and stories, as noted by RationalWiki:Sorcha Faal is the alleged author of an ongoing series of ""reports"" published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don't think much of it. The primary audience of Sorcha Faal's reports and the only ones who take them seriously are usually other conspiracy theorists ...Each report resembles a news story in its style, but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality (e.g. ""American Rebel Forces Attack Gas Pipelines, Explode Trains As US Civil War Nears"") and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service in the same article) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don't contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish.:The Stanford ConnectionStanford University does not operate or manage its own ""CIA Undergraduate Internship Program,"" but rather promotes that internship (which is operated by the CIA itself in Washington, D.C.) to its students, along with several other fellowships and professional opportunities, under the auspices of the university's Haas Center for Public Service.Christine Blasey Ford is a research psychologist at Stanford, not a CIA internship program administrator. None of the posts claiming she directs, leads, or is in charge of the internship program provided any evidence to that effect, and none of them explained or acknowledged that the internship is an external one, run by the CIA itself thousands of miles away from Stanford's campus.The Haas Center for Public Service lists four staff members responsible for advising students on internships and fellowship. including the CIA's undergraduate internship, and Blasey Ford is not one of them. This claim of a direct personal link between Blasey Ford and the CIA, via Stanford University, therefore falls down.:However, as an institution Stanford does have a history of working with the CIA, especially as part of Project MKUltra, a shadowy CIA-sponsored program in the 1950s and 1960s in which scientists and researchers, especially in the field of psychology, used drugs and other techniques to experiment with behavior modification and mind control.Stanford was just one of dozens of universities, research institutions, and hospitals across the United States that served as venues for such experimentation, which was at times illegal and unethical for using human beings as subjects, sometimes without their knowledge or consent. (Famously, the ""Unabomber"" Ted Kaczynski was subjected to brutal psychological experimentation, suspected to have been part of an MKUltra sub-project, while he was a promising mathematics student at Harvard in the late 1950s.)In January 1973, CIA Technical Services Director Sidney Gottlieb -- the infamous poisons expert who oversaw the MKUltra program -- destroyed many documents relating to the substance of the experiments  upon the order of then CIA Director Richard Helms, the U.S Senate would later hear. However, in 1977 a Freedom of Information Act request uncovered a trove of material, mostly invoices and other financial documents, relating to the program.:Among that trove were hundreds of pages establishing the fact that Stanford University had been one of the dozens of institutions where MKUltra experimentation took place. The documents are now available on the web site of the university itself and indicate that MKUltra activities occurred at Stanford from around 1953 to 1964, with many of the orders and invoices signed by Gottlieb himself.Ralph Blasey IIIHere's how the BrassBalls blog explained this strand of the conspiracy theory:Christine Blasey's brother [Ralph] used to work for the international law firm of Baker Hostetler. The firm created Fusion GPS, the company who wrote the Russian ""dossier"". They later admitted it was only a collection of field interviews. Baker Hostetler is located in the same building where the CIA operates three companies called Red Coats Inc., Admiral Security Services, and Datawatch. They are operated by Ralph Blasey II. He is the father of Christine and Ralph III.:This component of the overall theory is riddled with factual errors, fabrications, and logical failures.According to his LinkedIn profile, Ralph Blasey III (Christine's brother, and the son of Ralph Blasey Jr.) did indeed once work as a litigation partner for Baker Hostetler in the firm's Washington, D.C. office.But Baker Hostetler did not ""create"" Fusion GPS, as the blog post claims. Rather, in 2017 Fusion GPS told the Washington Post that they had performed some work as a subcontractor for Baker Hostetler, who were representing a Russian holding company in a money laundering case brought by the U.S. Justice Department. (More information about Fusion GPS' place in the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections can be viewed here.)However, Fusion GPS told the Post that their work for Baker Hostetler began in 2013, while Ralph Blasey III stopped working for the law firm in 2004, nine years before they engaged Fusion GPS.:Baker Hostetler's Washington, D.C. address is 1050 Connecticut Avenue Northwest. None of the three companies listed in the conspiracy theory as CIA fronts run by Ralph Blasey Jr. (Christine's father) has offices at that address. Ralph Blasey Jr. is listed as Vice President for Business Development of one of them, Red Coats, Inc., a Bethesda, Maryland-based cleaning company.Admiral Security Services (which provides security guard and concierge services) is a division of Red Coats, and Datawatch Systems is owned and operated by the same people but located at a different address (albeit within walking distance in Bethesda.)Ralph Blasey Jr. works for only one of those three companies, none of which shares an address with Baker Hostetler (the law firm which Ralph Blasey III, in any case, left in 2004) or has been shown by any evidence whatsoever to be ""operated"" by the CIA.Like many other companies in the Washington, D.C. area, Datawatch Systems, which provides doorway and access security services, does have contracts with several federal government departments and agencies, as does Red Coats, Inc., and Admiral Security Services. However, none of them has a contract with the CIA.:This attempt to link Christine Blasey Ford to the CIA through her brother Ralph therefore fails on several fronts.Nick DeakBefore we get to the substance of this part of the conspiracy theory, it's worth pointing out the profound logical flaw at the heart of it. The underlying premise here is that, if Christine Blasey Ford's grandfather was an intelligence agent, she herself must therefore be steeped in spycraft and have the same interests, temperament, and profession as her grandfather. Anyone with a different personality or career to that of their grandfather will instinctively recognize this assumption as nonsensical.In any event, the claim here is that Blasey Ford's grandfather was the legendary CIA-linked currency trader Nicholas ""Nick"" Deak. Without offering any evidence of a familial relationship, the BrassBalls blog stated that ""Christine and Ralph III's grandfather was Nicholas Deak. Former CIA Director William Casey acknowledged Deak's decades of service to the CIA."":Deak has been the subject of speculation and fascination for decades. In 1964, Time magazine called him ""the James Bond of the world of money,"" writing:Born in Hungary 58 years ago, Deak holds a doctorate in economics, can talk money in five languages, used to work for the League of Nations. A naturalized American, he spent World War II as an [Office of Strategic Services] agent parachuting into Burmese jungles to search for Japanese prisoners. On a postwar assignment, he sneaked Hungarian boxcars past the Russian occupiers to help rebuild West Germany's railways. Deak still keeps in OSS trim with a vegetarian diet, daily sprints around his own suburban running track, and ski trips with his Viennese wife. From a paneled office (cable address: Deaknick) overlooking lower Manhattan harbor, he supervises more than 100 agents working for Deak & Co., one of the world's biggest dealers in foreign currencies.In 1985, Deak was shot dead (along with his receptionist Frances Lauder) at his office in Lower Manhattan by Lois Lang, a homeless woman with a history of mental illness. Because of Deak's life-long connections to the CIA and a recent scandal which had implicated his firm in money laundering on behalf of international crime organizations, theories have been put forth that Lang was not merely motivated by her own delusions, as investigators concluded, but was acting under the direction of nefarious and organized forces, criminal or governmental.:In 2012, Arkadi Kuhlmann, who replaced Deak as CEO of his firm, told Salon of his own skepticism about the official account of his predecessor's murder:""I never believed that the whole thing was random,"" said Kuhlmann, in an interview with Salon. Ditto the government inquiry that triggered the collapse preceding Lang's rampage. ""We were the CIA's paymaster, and that got to be a little bit embarrassing for them,"" he said. ""Our time had passed and the usefulness of doing things our way had vanished. The world was changing in the '80s; you couldn't just accept bags of cash. Deak was slow at making those changes. And when you lose your sponsorship, you're out of the game.""Whatever the truth about the death of Nicholas Deak, one thing is clear: he was not Christine Blasey Ford's grandfather. Multiple news articles before and after his death stipulated that he had only one child, a son named Robert Leslie, also known as ""Les.""This information obviously rules out the possibility that Deak was Blasey Ford's maternal grandfather, and since we know her father is Ralph Blasey Jr., we can say with certainty that Deak was not her paternal grandfather either. This eliminates the third and final component of the conspiracy theory, as articulated by Michael Savage and others.:Interestingly, the WhatDoesItMean.com does not claim that Deak was Blasey Ford's grandfather, but rather connects the two by way of another figure from a bygone era, Dr. Frederick Melges:Though the American people were correctly told that Nicolas Deak assassin Lois Lang had previously been under psychiatric care, this report continues, what was failed to be reported to them was that Lang had been under the direct care and medical supervision of the CIA's own Stanford University Psychiatric Professor Dr. Frederick T. Melges just prior to her traveling from Seattle to New York City to carry out this assassination--and who was the exact type of assassin Dr. Melges had been working to create in his CIA-funded mind control MKULTRA programme--and whose Canadian victims of are still being silenced after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, this past December, imposed a gag order on them to keep them silent--but that does apply to Judge Kavanaugh accuser Dr. Christine Blasey, who remains able to teach her CIA Undergraduate Internship Program at Stanford University the MKULTRA mind control techniques discovered by Dr. Melges.The claims that Lang had been treated by Dr. Melges, and that Melges was associated with the MKUltra project, was written about in Salon's 2012 account of Deak's death::In August 1975, records show that Lang was discovered naked and catatonic in a Santa Clara motel room ... Police responding to the motel room took Lang to nearby Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. For the next month, she was put under the care of Dr. Frederick Melges, a psychiatrist associated with the Stanford Research Institute. One of Dr. Melges' main areas of research: drug-aided hypnosis. A few years after Lang was put in Melges' care, the New York Times exposed the Stanford Research Institute as a center for CIA research into ""brain-washing"" and ""mind-control"" experiments in which unwitting subjects were dosed with hallucinogenic drugs and subjected to hypnosis ...The Stanford Research Institute received CIA funding, and Dr. Melges published work about using drugs and hypnosis to create ""disassociative states,"" i.e., induced schizophrenia. One of Melges' partners on these experiments was a doctor named Leo E. Hollister, who first dosed Ken Kesey with LSD as part of an Army experiment in 1960. He later admitted to author John Marks that he conducted drug research for the CIA ...In other words, the doctor who cared for Lang in Santa Clara was a senior figure at one of the CIA's top institutional grantees. He worked side-by-side with a self-identified CIA collaborator, and conducted research into the kind of drug-induced behavior modification that the agency is known to have funded.:We were unable to verify the claim that Dr. Melges took Lang into his care in 1975, or what that treatment might have entailed. Frederick Towne Melges (known as ""Rusty"") was a psychiatrist from Battle Creek, Michigan, who received his medical degree from Columbia University before working at the University of Rochester and Duke University in later years.In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Melges worked at Stanford University, researching the perception of time. He conducted studies into the effects of cannabis and alcohol on time perception, personal perceptions of the future, persecutory delusion among people with acute mental illness, and several subjects related to human emotion. Some of his research involved administering doses of THC (the hallucinatory component in cannabis) as well as alcohol.We were not able to verify the claim that Melges worked at the Stanford Research Institute, and it is unclear whether he ever took part in any MKUltra-related experimentation. However, even if one accepts for the sake of argument the claims made by WhatDoesItMean.com and Salon, no meaningful link exists between Dr. Melges and Christine Blasey Ford.:Melges, who suffered from diabetes, died at the age of 52 in Durham, North Carolina, in July 1988, having worked at Duke University since 1977. Blasey Ford got her undergraduate degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1988, then received a master's in clinical psychology from Pepperdine University in 1991, a PhD in educational psychology from the University of Southern California in 1996, and a master's in epidemiology from Stanford University in 2009.She and Melges never attended or worked at the same university contemporaneously. The earliest record we could find of Blasey Ford's working at Stanford was in the year 2000, by which time Melges had been dead for 12 years (and had left Stanford more than a decade before that).Even if Melges were associated with the MKUltra program, the fact of Christine Blasey Ford's attendance and employment at Stanford several decades later does not even come close to establishing a link between the two."
35,35,35,559.FakeNewsWhySnopesPre,"Arriving as a new employee to Snopes in fall 2018, I discovered that this storied fact-checking operation, a household name in the fight against ""fake news,"" preferred to avoid using the term ""fake news.""""Ok ...,"" I Slacked.Nevermind the phrase raining down in conversations with friends and waterfalling over comment threads I monitor for Snopes. I wasn't ready to argue with my new bosses. I opened my umbrella and carried on.According to one archive, President Donald Trump has tweeted the phrase ""fake news"" more than 450 times as president. Often in his tweets ""fake news"" stands proxy as a vague noun that lets him impugn whole industries of journalists at once, including you know who::The more I wrote around the phrase ""fake news"" in my work writing social media posts and other Snopes copy, the more bizarre it felt. Like we'd stripped ""giant"" from David's style guide.Speaking of Davids, founder of Snopes.com David Mikkelson pointed out to me that Snopes was using the term ""fake news"" long before Trump was employing it as a near-daily insult. In fact, many people were. As Merriam-Webster observed, ""'Fake news' is a new term. That means it's only about 125 years old.""For a while around 2013-14, Snopes and others in the fact-checking industry understood and used ""fake news"" narrowly, to refer specifically to (the relatively small) set of websites that intentionally pumped out fabricated stories for laughs, for lucrative clicks, or for other reasons we may never understand. Whatever the motive, the content produced by these sites was often so absurd you (almost) did not need a fact-checker to point out it was fake.For example:::Things change.More than one recent Snopes investigation has uncovered clandestine and coordinated efforts by entities pretending to be something they are not online. And their actions appear to be politically motivated.Meanwhile, the prevalence of ""deepfake"" videos is raising alarm about how even savvy users can be fooled by deceptively altered and edited content.And of course, ""fake news"" is a feared threat to elections worldwide. One of the first things despots do in democratic societies, Snopes managing editor Doreen Marchionni sometimes reminds us, is to demonize journalists. Take down the journalists -- in print, in broadcast, online or on social platforms -- and so goes democracy.In a recent interview, journalist Maria Ressa criticized social media platforms for failing to accept their responsibility in the spread of misinformation and disinformation. ""They broke democracy,"" she told CBS News.:Not surprisingly, as the implications of ""fake news"" have shifted, so too has the definition.When ""fake news"" was introduced to Dictionary.com in 2017, Time magazine was already noting there was more than to the phrase than was captured in its recorded definition.Craig Silverman, a media editor for BuzzFeed News who has been credited with helping to mainstream the phrase, wrote that he came to cringe at it:The end of ""fake news"" as I knew it came on Jan. 11, 2017, when Donald Trump -- master of branding -- redefined the term to mean, effectively, news reports he didn't like. The previous day CNN and BuzzFeed News had reported on the existence of the Steele dossier. [...]Political movements around the world recognized the genius of Trump's tactic and adopted it. Now, ""fake news"" is a global phrase uttered by leaders and citizens alike. It's emblazoned on T-shirts, used in memes, abused as a hashtag. It's never been more ubiquitous and, as a result, more confused and manipulated.:He wasn't alone. Washington Post columnist Margaret Sullivan had already called for the term's retirement altogether, arguing its meaning had been lost:""Instead, call a lie a lie,"" Sullivan advised. ""Call a hoax a hoax. Call a conspiracy theory by its rightful name. After all, 'fake news' is an imprecise expression to begin with.""This was also my boss' contention with the phrase. ""Information doesn't necessarily have to be fake or false to qualify as 'fake news,'"" Mikkelson explained.One ""fake news"" creator in Macedonia confirmed as much to the BBC:""That thing happened, the people were there, the place was there. So it was never fake stories"" in the sense of fabricating every detail. ""It was propaganda and brainwashing in the way of telling the story."":The contradiction doesn't seem to trip up readers. According to a 2017 Gallup/Knight Foundation Survey on Trust, Media and Democracy:Americans themselves have not reached a clear consensus on what constitutes ""fake news."" Most adults agree that false information portrayed as if it were true always (48%) or sometimes (46%) deserves the label ""fake news."" Strikingly, most Americans also say that accurate stories portraying politicians in a negative light always (28%) or sometimes (51%) constitutes ""fake news.""""Fake news"" evolved to signify not a measure of a claim's veracity but, rather, its potential for challenging one's preferred perception.As The Atlantic noted in an analysis of a 2019 Pew Research Center study, there can be a consequence to perceiving information as threatening:While nearly six in 10 Democrats have dropped an outlet over perceived fake news, a full 70 percent of Republicans have. A much larger portion of Republicans has also reduced their overall consumption of news. The less politically aware are also 20 percent more likely to have reduced their overall consumption of news than the more politically aware -- meaning that people who were already acquiring the least information are now acquiring even less.:At Snopes we strive to contribute information to public discourse, not subtract from it. If ""fake news"" can no longer reliably signal whether a piece of reporting is trustworthy, and instead behaves like a rhetorical middle finger, it doesn't have a place in our work.So what to say instead?AP Stylebook suggests alternatives such as ""false reports,"" which misses the point for our purposes. Again, information doesn't have to be ""false"" to be considered ""fake news"" in common parlance. A ""big person"" does not a ""giant"" make.Mikkelson favored ""junk news"" as a more useful label. And he pointed me to an interesting rationale explained by Centre for Internet and Society researcher Tommaso Venturini:So, if ""fake news"" is not about false information, what is it about? ... spread, rather than fakeness, is the birthmark of these contents that should be called ""viral news"" or possibly ""junk news"" for, just as junk food, they are consumed because they are addictive, not because they are appreciated.:This is not to argue engaging with misinformation is not tantamount to indulging in the occasional cheeseburger. Rather, it seems logical that a media diet that favors junk would have consequences, just as a real diet that has an excess of sodium and fat. Venturini again:'Junk news' is dangerous not because it is false, but because it saturates public debate, leaving little space to other discussions, reducing the richness of public debate and preventing more important stories from being heard.In other words, the threat of junk news lies in the absence of what it's displacing: actual information.In a 2017 report on ""Information Disorder,"" researchers Claire Wardle and Hossein Derakhshan recommended several steps for tackling the problems of all manner of misinformation. Number one on that list?1. Definitions. Think more critically about the language we use so we can effectively capture the complexity of the phenomenon:Put another way: ""Media literacy works, and it just might save humanity,"" according to Columbia Journalism Review.Back to that Pew study:""Of the 52% of Americans who say they have shared made-up news themselves, a vast majority of them said they didn't know it was made up when they did so.""This highlights the challenge: We cannot fight what we cannot see. We cannot change what we cannot name.By using the phrase ""junk news,"" we aim to emphasize the distinction between misinformation and content created purposely to deceive.More precision, not less, is key if we want to understand better and be better understood.:Most useful of all, by using ""junk news"" we can clearly signal such content's best possible destination:The trash."

But the video provides no documentation whatsoever that any aspect of that narrative is true: it offers no proof at all that the buses seen in the video were originally parked at the airport next to an inbound UPS flight, no proof that any passengers were carried on that UPS cargo flight, no proof that any supposed passengers from that arriving (cargo) flight were loaded onto waiting buses, nor any proof about of the point of origin or political status of these alleged passengers. The clip is nothing more than a dark, shaky phone video shot by someone driving behind some nondescript buses as they passed signs indicating they were near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, accompanied by some conspiracy theory narration lacking any shred of evidence to back it up.Moreover, no one else reported witnessing the arrival or offloading of the buses comprising this alleged secret refugee convoy at any end destination.In response to the video, a spokesperson from UPS flatly denied that passengers had been unloaded from any of their planes at the Harrisburg airport::UPS is a cargo airline and has not been involved in passenger flights of any kind into or out of Harrisburg. Suggestions to the contrary are based on misinformation.The notion that refugees are being smuggled into the country on international mail flights conforms to the standard urban legend type of a secret government plot's being revealed through the inexplicable choice of using a commercial carrier to carry out a key element of the furtive operation."
37,37,37,590.IsPeterStrzokaCIAOpe,"Claim:FBI agent Peter Strzok II grew up in Iran; had a father who engaged in clandestine activities overseas under the guise of doing charitable work; served as a ""Middle East intel operative"" in the Obama administration; and was a CIA agent ""placed"" in the FBI to help Hillary Clinton win the presidency.Rating:UnprovenAbout this rating Longtime FBI agent Peter Strzok II, who until recently served as deputy assistant director of the agency's Counterintelligence Division, gained public notoriety when he was removed from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Trump-Russia investigation for sending private text messages critical of the president.:Formerly the lead FBI investigator into Hillary Clinton's use of a private e-mail server while she was secretary of state, Strzok has since come under investigation himself by the Justice Department's inspector general, been grilled on his ethical integrity by the House Oversight Committee, and stands accused by conspiracy theorists of being a linchpin in a ""deep state"" plot to sabotage Trump's presidency.A July 2018 salvo from the far-right blog Big League Politics attempted to make the case that Strzok, who spent part of his childhood in Iran, is a covert CIA operative who served the Iranian regime's interests while allegedly acting as a ""key Middle Eastern Intel operative"" for President Obama, then was ""placed in the FBI to ensure a win for Hillary Clinton"" in the 2016 presidential election.That salvo was a mishmash of accusations derived in part from the supposed ""insider"" testimony of an anonymous former co-worker of Strzok's, in part from misreadings of public documents (including decades-old press clippings about Strzok's father), and in part from a labored effort to connect dots that simply aren't there.:The post began as follows:EXPOSED: Peter Strzok Grew Up In Iran, Worked As Obama and Brennan's Envoy To Iranian RegimeA former co-worker of Peter Strzok tells Big League Politics about Strzok's extensive background in the intelligence community, including the fact that he grew up in Iran. Many intelligence officers like Strzok are complete ghosts with questionable history and gaps in their life story. But now we have some insight. (RELATED: Strzok Worked For CIA And FBI At Same Time, According To Document).Peter Strzok was born in the late 1960's - he attended the American School in Iran up until 1978 when it closed down and then he attended the American School in Saudi Arabia. He supposedly attended a Catholic School, St. John's Prep in Minneapolis (the school refused to confirm or deny attendance) and then completed a Bachelors at Georgetown and some form of graduate degree after that.The truth is that after Peter Strzok III turned 18 his life is arcane, which is the usual story of many like him. Did you know that Peter Strzok II (Strzok's father) and Hillary Clinton have a lot in common? It turns out after advocating for Khomeni in Iran and then working in Saudi Arabia to calm the waters of an Iranian government (appeasing them with anti-Semitic rhetoric), Strzok's father Strzok II also dabbled in ""charity work."" Strzok's father was involved in so-called charity work in Haiti but also helped dismantle and reassemble Upper Volta..now known as Burkina Faso.:We interrupt here to point out that the author of the post appears to have misstated several details: Peter Strzok wasn't born in the late 1960s; he was born on 7 March 1970 (according to a birth announcement in the Sault Sainte Marie, Michigan Evening News). His father is Peter Strzok Sr., not Peter Strzok II (Strzok Sr.'s father's name was Michael, not Peter). Peter Strzok II is FBI agent Peter Strzok. Unless the latter fathered a namesake, there is no Peter Strzok III.The claim that Strzok ""grew up"" in Iran is an overstatement. The Strzoks moved there while Strzok Sr. was serving in the Army Corps of Engineers, from which he retired in July 1978. While we don't know precisely how long the family resided there, the Eau Claire, Wisconsin Leader-Telegram reported in 1979 that the Strzoks left Iran at the beginning of that year to return to the U.S. because of the political unrest that followed the overthrow of the Shah. Peter was eight years old at the time.The same article said that Strzok Sr. was then considering taking a job in Saudi Arabia. It's unclear whether he did or not. If the Strzok family did move to Saudi Arabia, it was for a very short period of time, given that Strzok Sr. accepted a job with the international aid organization Catholic Relief Services (CRS) in 1980 and relocated his family to Upper Volta (a country in Africa now known as Burkina Faso). The Strzoks would be there for three years.:As for his schooling, the younger Strzok attended the American School in Tehran (where his mother also taught), as claimed. We've not been able to confirm that he attended school in Saudi Arabia. Once back in the United States, Strzok didn't ""supposedly"" attend St. John's Preparatory School (as the Big League Politics blogger put it) -- he did, in fact, attend that school (which is in St. Cloud, Minnesota, not Minneapolis) from 1983 through 1987, and his graduation notice appeared in the St. Cloud Times on 15 May 1987. He later earned bachelor's and master's degrees at Georgetown University (as noted on an alumni donor list published on the school's web site).An outsized portion of the Big League Politics post was devoted to Strzok's father's life, as if to posit that father and son have been operating some sort of ""deep state"" conspiratorial family business for the past 40 years. The author went to great lengths to impute insidious motives to Strzok Sr.'s overseas humanitarian projects, which -- far from being something he ""dabbled"" in (as the post describes it) -- to all appearances became his life's work after he retired from military service.Strzok Sr. served as the director of Catholic Relief Services in Upper Volta for three years. There is no evidence that he ""helped dismantle and reassemble"" that country, which underwent a military coup while he was there. Strzok ran a food assistance and nutrition education program that served some 150,000 children and mothers. Nor, contrary to another claim in the post, was he still present in Upper Volta when its name was changed to Burkina Faso in 1984 (not 1985, as claimed).:In mid-1983 Strzok accepted the post of CRS director in Haiti. We know he was there for less than two years, because a New York Times report published in August 1985 names ""former employee"" Peter Strzok as one of three complainants in a dispute over Catholic Relief Services' alleged mishandling of funds. His time in Haiti coincided with the final few years of the rule of Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier, who would be overthrown in 1986.Our blogger took a special interest in the fact that Strzok Sr. lived and worked in a succession of international hot spots, repeatedly insinuating that he must have been engaged in espionage or other clandestine activities. ""Looks like whenever there is a regime change in modern history a Strzok is lying in the shadows waiting,"" the post said. But ironically, far from ""lying in the shadows,"" the only reason we know as much as we do about Peter Strzok Sr.'s whereabouts over the past 40 years is that he spoke so freely and openly about his activities in the press. We can't prove he wasn't a covert operative, of course, but neither has anyone else demonstrated that he was.One of the oddest claims in the post was that Strzok Sr. was involved in the Iran-Contra affair (involving the illegal sale of arms to Iran to fund the Contras in Nicaragua), which took place during the mid-1980s under President Reagan. We were unable to find evidence that Strzok played any role at all in Iran-Contra, or was mentioned in the news coverage or congressional hearings that followed the scandal. The coverage that does exist about Strzok from that time indicates that he was actively engaged in doing humanitarian aid work in West Africa.:There was also an attempt to link Strzok Sr. up with the Clintons:The Clinton Foundation and The Catholic Relief Services (CRS) seem to work in tangent [sic]. Coincidence? Peter Strzok Sr. was actually the director of CRS in Haiti. If we look into CRS financials they seem to overlap and feed into Clinton Global initiatives and balance sheets.Never mind that the Clinton Foundation wasn't launched until 1997, more than a decade after Strzok left CRS and founded his own non-government agency, AFGRO (Agency to Facilitate the Growth of Rural Organizations). Whatever ""overlap"" there may be, or have been -- if any -- between the Clinton Foundation and Catholic Relief Services, no such thing could have existed when Strzok was involved with the latter organization.The purpose of asserting these nonexistent connections was to create the appearance of a continuum of father-son involvement with Iran, Haiti, and the Clintons::We know Peter Strzok III [sic], the man who sent those vile text messages about our President. The man who was biased and wanted to ensure a Clinton Presidency was raised in Iran and Saudi Arabia.Our source reveals how Strzok and his father both talked about Iran favorably and both accidently reminisced about the rose water smell of the ju-jeh kebab by Shemiran Hill... something that disappeared after 1987 and only those who are old enough to remember can discuss.Peter Strzok's Persian is impeccable.Our insider tells us that Peter Strzok III [sic] is the key Middle Eastern Intel operative for the Iranian airline Mahan Air's purchase of United States government planes during the Obama administration from 2011 to 2013 (when Iran sanctions were in place). He handled the Iranian relations from start to finish. Just like his father did for Reagan and just like he's been doing for years under cloak and dagger says the BLP insider.Once again, we have searched for any scrap of documentation that might prove that Peter Strzok II (the FBI agent) served as ""the key Middle Eastern intel operative"" in negotiations between the U.S. and Iran during the Obama administration, and we found none. As an FBI counterintelligence officer, there is no reason why the younger Strzok would or could have played such a role anyway. :Big League Politics had a ready explanation for this, though, namely that Strzok was actually working for the CIA:The BLP insider who's worked with both [former CIA director John] Breannan [sic] and Strzok tells us that Strzok was never FBI he was part of the highest level of covert operatives, sliding into posts within the CIA or FBI to infiltrate, influence and observe. This is exactly what we saw with the Special Counsel appointment that resulted after a failed operation.Peter Strzok Jr. was placed in the FBI to ensure a win for Hillary Clinton and buffer negative press (like the Weiner laptop case, which he covered up). That's the real deal. Revealing Peter Strzok's identity would have been a problem because it's called unmasking but since he is in the limelight and out of the shadows it's time to lay all the cards FACE up on the table for all to see who Peter Strzok really is.In addition to citing the anonymous informant as the source of this claim, the post linked out to an article referencing an unclassified document that supposedly proved Strzok worked for the CIA and the FBI at the same time::A [sic] unclassified document printed on FBI letterhead dated January 20, 2016, which contains the subject line ""Supplemental Classification Review and Determination"" was addressed to the Bureau of National Security's Assistant Secretary Gregory B. Starr from Peter Strzok who is listed as ""Section Chief"" of the ""Counterespionage Section"" in reference to Strzok's CIA post. Keep in mind, this is not an FBI post as Strzok's position at the FBI is ""Deputy Assistant Director Counterintelligence Division"" not ""Section Chief"" which is a CIA post.Which is utter nonsense. Although the specified document did list Strzok's title as ""section chief"" of the Counterespionage Section, it's patently untrue that section chief isn't an FBI post. Both agencies have sections and chiefs (and assistant section chiefs). Not only was section chief precisely the position Strzok held before being promoted to deputy assistant director at the FBI, but others have held that title, too.The claim that Strzok was ""placed in the FBI to ensure a win for Hillary Clinton"" is flatly absurd. Strzok joined the agency in 1996. Was the plot to ensure a Hillary Clinton win in 2016 already in motion 20 years beforehand?:The Big League Politics post was a clumsy, error-ridden effort to generate a ""deep state"" conspiracy theory around FBI agent Peter Strzok, who, up until the text message incident that derailed him in 2017, seems to have trodden a fairly straightforward career path in the agency over a period of more than two decades.Peter Strzok spent several years of his childhood in Iran, but he did not ""grow up"" there. There is no evidence nor any good reason to suppose that he acted as an ""envoy"" or ""intel operative"" in U.S. dealings with Iran at any time during the Obama administration. And the claim that Strzok is or was a covert CIA operative ""placed"" in the FBI to help Hillary Clinton win the presidency and subvert the Trump administration is a flight of fancy divorced from all evidence and logic."
38,38,38,452.DidCBSReportThatElit,"Claim:CBS reported that elites are ingesting the blood of young children in order to achieve 'eternal youth.'Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 26 December 2018, the News Punch junk news site (formerly the equally disreputable Your News Wire junk news site) published an article claiming that CBS had reported on ""world leaders and elite businessmen"" who supposedly  ""ingest the blood of young children in order to achieve 'eternal youth'""::CBS: Elites Are Lining up to Ingest the Blood of ChildrenWorld leaders and elite businessmen are ingesting the blood of young children in order to achieve 'eternal youth,' a CBS report warns.What was once dismissed as a 'conspiracy theory' is now being publicly acknowledged by billionaires and the mainstream media.That News Punch report was typically distorted and deliberately misleading, intended to foster a false picture of vampiric patrons feasting on the blood of children to maintain themselves in a state of youthful immortality.The underlying information that formed basis of the News Punch article did not come from CBS News, but rather from a two-minute, speculative health segment produced by Philadelphia television station KYW.  And that segment did not state, or even remotely suggest, that anyone was ""ingesting"" the blood of ""young children"" in order to ""achieve eternal youth.""That KYW segment was itself mostly a brief rehash of some recent studies which found that giving older mice infusions of blood plasma from younger mice seemingly improved the former's performance in learning and memory tests.  Other studies are ongoing to determine whether the process might have any applicability in human beings::The segment also referenced the efforts of a company called Ambrosia, which as reported by Wired, performed a controversial human trial on a small group of subjects over age 35 whom they charged $8,000 each to receive a few liters of plasma donated by young adults:In 2016, a company called Ambrosia launched the first human trial of young plasma transfusions, charging patients $8,000 a pop to participate. Anyone over 35 with the necessary cash was eligible to receive two liters of plasma donated by young adults, which Ambrosia purchases from blood banks. Given the fee and the lack of a placebo treatment to compare it to, scientists and bioethicists have questioned the rigor of the study. But those barbs haven't stopped Ambrosia's founder, Jesse Karmazin, from being bullish on the (unpublished) results of the trial, which he announced for the first time at the Recode technology conference last May.""We measured 113 biomarkers 30 days after the transfusion and we saw a durable, but not permanent, effect,"" says Karmazin, who has an MD from Stanford but no license to practice medicine. (He initially conducted the trial with a physician who runs a private intravenous therapy center in Monterey, California, but later moved to sites in San Francisco and Tampa after a falling out between them.) Karmazin says the study participants described feeling stronger, more awake, and as if their memory had improved. ""We saw results that were consistent with the preclinical work in mice.""Ambrosia's trial initially intended to enroll 600 patients, but in the end only included 81 individuals.:The effectiveness -- and advisability -- of even that small Ambrosia trial has been challenged by those who maintain it holds the potential to do more harm than good:Irina and Michael Conboy, two University of California at Berkeley researchers who've published research on young blood transfusions in mice, called Ambrosia's plans ""dangerous.""""They quite likely could inflict bodily harm,"" Irina Conboy [said].Michael Conboy said part of the problem is simply the fact that there's too much old blood for the young blood to have a substantial effect on its own.""Is there really something in the young blood that would override all the negative effects from the old blood?"" Conboy said. ""Until someone repeats that I'm not sure that I believe it. Even scientists with the best of intentions can observe something that's a fluke.""Meanwhile, the Conboys said there are substantial risks with giving older people the young blood of donors. Those include a heightened immune response which is triggered with increasing magnitude every time the procedure is completed.:The important points here are that 1) Nobody involved in any such studies (which are still largely confined to rodents) is ""ingesting"" the blood of children -- the few research efforts using humans to date involved subjects' receiving infusions/transfusions of blood plasma, not drinking blood, and 2) Even the controversial Ambrosia trial used blood plasma donated by young adults, not ""young children.""  In no case are ""world leaders and elite businessmen ... lining up to ingest the blood of young children,"" as falsely claimed by News Punch."
39,39,39,94.NoTrumpDidntMurderaW,"Claim:Donald Trump murdered a woman named Carolyn Gombell in 2000. Rating:FalseAbout this rating In response to U.S. President Donald Trump's penchant for spreading conspiracy theories (in particular, the insinuation that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough killed an intern years ago), his critics on social media invented a conspiracy theory of their own: Trump, they claimed, killed a woman named Carolyn Gombell in 2000.The rumor started with a tweet from God on May 26, 2020::That and subsequent tweets in a thread started by the Twitter account TheTweetOfGod (hereafter referred to as ToG) followed a pattern similar to that of conspiracy theories pushed by Trump and his supporters: It made an outlandish claim and then attempted to prove it true by ""connecting"" a series of dots. ToG, for instance, followed up this claim with several ""FACTS"" about the alleged incident. ToG claimed that Gombell's mother had an audio recording of ""her daughter the night before she was killed saying, 'If something happens to me it was Donald.'"" ToG claimed that Officer Bernard Kerik had written in his autobiography that he had made ""certain inconvenient facts disappear"" for a ""a certain well-known real-estate magnate."" And ToG claimed that Gombell's roommate, Michelle White, died of ""suicide"" just two weeks after Gombell's death.:But the coup de grace, a fixture of so many conspiracy theories, was the claim that verifiable information regarding Gombell's death had been mysteriously scrubbed from all of the usual places as part of a cover-up.Taken at face value, these ""facts"" paint a damning picture: The President of the United States killed a woman in 2000. Even for readers with a slightly more discerning eye, this thread still ""raised questions"" and suggested that Trump was likely involved in some sort of nefarious activity.:Before we start pulling apart this set of claims, let's make something clear: Donald Trump did not murder a woman named Carolyn Gombell in 2000. Carolyn Gombell never existed.This thread was posted on May 26, 2020, the same day Twitter announced that it would not remove Trump's tweets pushing a debunked conspiracy theory about MSNBC's Joe Scarborough supposedly killing an intern named Lori Klausutis, despite her widower's pleas that the platform do so. ToG created a conspiracy theory that mirrored this and others pushed by the president, except that ToG's conspiracy theory was directed at the president himself.""Facts"" #1 & #2: Where's the Evidence?While some may disagree with ToG's tactic, it does give us an opportunity to pull apart a conspiracy theory to show just how it was put together. ToG's first ""fact"" claims that there's an audio recording of Gombell naming Trump as her potential killer. However, saying something exists does not make that thing exist. As you'll notice, this viral thread does not actually link to an audio file of Gombell making this statement.:ToG's second ""fact"" makes a similarly baseless claim. While this account says that forensics first ""matched the residual thumbprints found on Carolyn's neck as 'matching' Trump's own (small) hands,"" they provide no supporting evidence to back up this claim. ""Fact"" #3: A Nonexistent BookIn ToG's third fact, we finally have something that we can truly investigate. Not only does ToG claim that ""Kerik"" (referring to former New York Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik) wrote about the incident in his 2009 autobiography ""One Good Cop,"" but ToG also provides the alleged page number. At first glance, this detail makes it seem like this rumor is valid and verified. ToG, after all, just provided a source for his claim and most readers are not going to take the time to look up this passage. If they did, however, they'd see that this book does not actually exist. :Kerik has written two autobiographies about his experiences as police commissioner and as the minister of the interior of Iraq, and his jailing for fraud and lying to authorities, but neither of these books was titled ""One Good Cop."" The first, published in 2001, was titled ""The Lost Son: A Life in Pursuit of Justice,"" and the other, published in 2015, was titled ""From Jailer to Jailed: My Journey from Correction and Police Commissioner to Inmate #84888-054."" Although Kerik did not write a book entitled ""One Good Cop"" in which he admitted to ""disappearing evidence"" for a certain ""real estate mogul,"" we imagine that his name was included in this thread for a reason. It grounds this conspiracy theory at least partly in reality -- Kerik, after all, was a real and controversial figure -- and provides interested parties an opportunity to ask some suspicious questions: Why did Trump issue a full pardon to Kerik? Was it because Kerik helped him cover up a murder?While ToG did not make this specific accusation, the account did provide just enough information to let people start drawing their own conclusions. :The Death of Michelle White?The fourth ""fact"" provided by ToG insinuates that not only did Trump murder a woman named Carolyn Gombell, supposedly, but he also had her roommate killed to cover up the crime. ToG does not directly make this accusation, either. Rather, they put the words ""committed suicide"" in quotation marks to imply that while this is the official narrative, it may also not be the truth. This is another common tactic used by purveyors of misinformation (notably those spreading the similar ""Clinton Body Bags"" conspiracy theories for the past quarter-century). We searched Newspapers.com for articles reporting that a woman named ""Michelle White"" threw herself in front of a train in New York in 2000, but again, we came up empty-handed. The ""Cover-Up""Why weren't we able to find any information about a woman named Carolyn Gombell? According to ToG, it's because all of the information regarding her death has been scrubbed from the internet as part of a massive cover-up to protect Trump. While this certainly sounds suspicious -- damning, even -- it also provides convenient cover to hide a baseless claim.:The fact of the matter is that searching the internet for articles on the death of Carolyn Gombell doesn't yield many results, not because these articles were deleted as part of a cover up, but because they never existed in the first place.It Starts with a Joke...When we first came across ToG's thread on May 26, 2020, we thought it was obvious that this Twitter account was using the language of conspiracy theorists to make a point about how easy it is to start a baseless rumor, and also to challenge social media platforms to enforce their content policies. Soon thereafter, however, we started to receive queries from people who thought that there might be some truth to the claim that Trump killed a woman in 2000. The day following ToG's thread, fake obituary pages were published for ""Carolyn Gombell"" on websites such as DeadDeath and Ever Loved. The hashtag #JusticeForCarolyn also trended on Twitter as social media users spread the baseless claim. While this may seem an obvious ruse now, in May 2020, it's easy to imagine people being taken in by this claim if they were to encounter it for the first time a week or a month afterward. :Did President Trump Murder a Woman Named Carolyn Gombell in 2000?No. This conspiracy theory was invented in May 2020 as a criticism of President Trump for spreading baseless rumors, and of the social networks that allow him to do so. Did Joe Scarborough Murder an Intern in 2001?No.In May 2020, President Trump repeatedly insinuated that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough had murdered a woman. The president, just like the ToG Twitter account, made outlandish and evidence-free claims, asked leading questions, and provided just enough detail to let his followers start connecting imaginary dots:   :The biggest difference between Trump's tweets and those of TheTweetofGod is that Trump's accusations deal with the death of real woman, Lori Klausutis, who died in 2001, reportedly as a result of a heart condition. But this is not a ""cold case,"" as Trump claims, and MSNBC host Joe Scarborough is not a murder suspect. In fact, Scarborough was hundreds of miles away at the time of Klausutis' death."
40,40,40,158.DidaScientificStudyP,"Claim:A scientific study demonstrated that conspiracy theorists are generally more sane than other people.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Back in 2014, the decidedly pro-conspiracy website Natural News, whose founder Mike Adams sometimes serves as a guest host for Alex Jones' Infowars, gleefully exclaimed that science had proved conspiracy theorists are generally ""more sane"" than people who hold more ""conformist"" views -- as evidenced by their publication of an article headlined ""Scientific Study Reveals Conspiracy Theorists the Most Sane of All."":In point of fact, the study referenced in that article, whose sole dataset comprised comments left by readers of news articles that included the term ""9/11"" and similar keywords, did not make such a claim. That paper, titled ""'What About Building 7?' A Social Psychological Study of Online Discussion of 9/11 Conspiracy Theories"" made a series of qualitative observations based on 2,174 collected comments, as follows:We found that conspiracist commenters were more likely to argue against the opposing interpretation and less likely to argue in favor of their own interpretation, while the opposite was true of conventionalist commenters. Conspiracist comments were more likely to explicitly put forward an account than conventionalist comments were.Conspiracists were more likely to express mistrust and made more positive and fewer negative references to other conspiracy theories. Conspiracists were largely unwilling to apply the ""conspiracy theory"" label to their own beliefs and objected when others did so, lending support to the long-held suggestion that conspiracy belief carries a social stigma.Conventionalist arguments tended to have a more hostile tone.:Natural News derived their assertion that ""conspiracists"" are ""more sane"" from combining the latter observation about tone with their own severely flawed understanding of sampling biases:The researchers noted that they were surprised to find that it is now more conventional to leave so-called conspiracist comments than conventional ones. ""Of the 2174 comments collected, 1459 were coded as conspiracist and 715 as conventionalist,"" the researchers wrote ...That means the pro-conspiracy commenters are those who are now expressing what is considered conventional wisdom, while the anti-conspiracy commenters represent a small, beleaguered minority that is often scoffed at and shunned.That inherently flawed interpretation relied on the somewhat terrifying assumption that the views expressed in the comments section of news articles about the September 11th terrorist attacks were a representative cross-section of the population as a whole, a rather harrowing notion. In fact, it should be unsurprising that the majority of the comments collected by the researchers were pro-conspiracy theory, as that is explicitly the kind of comment the researchers searched for::For each article that resulted from these searches [of keywords such as ""9/11""], the public comment sections were read, and from these, we extracted verbatim all relevant comments regarding the 9/11 conspiracy theories.The study did not even capture a representative sample of the comments left on news stories about 9/11, much less the views of the broader population about 9/11. Therefore, the study cannot be used to make the claim that ""pro-conspiracy commenters are those who are now expressing what is considered conventional wisdom.""With regard to the tone of comments, it is unclear where Natural News got the idea that the hostile tone of a comment responding to a 9/11 conspiracy indicates a lack of sanity, but the study at no point makes any claim about comparative sanity levels.The study did conclude, however, that ""conspiracism is rooted in several higher-order beliefs such as an abiding mistrust of authority, the conviction that nothing is quite as it seems, and the belief that most of what we are told is a lie."" The study also noted that their results aligned with previous observations ""that conspiracy theories rely heavily on 'errant data' rather than on crafting coherent alternative explanations."":If a hostile tone betrays a lack of sanity, then Natural News -- an outlet whose operator created an entire website named ""Hoggwatch"" dedicated to harassing Parkland school shooting survivor and gun control activist David Hogg -- must be in desperate need of some rationality."
41,41,41,592.SwineFluWarning,"Claim:   The CDC has warned that the swine flu is wiping out villages in Asia and will kill 60% of the U.S. population.FALSEExample:   [Collected via e-mail, August 2009]Latest on H1N1 straight from the CDC and Johns HopkinsI'm not a bearer of 'fear', but think we all should pay attention to THIS one.The CDC says H1N1 is currently wiping out entire villages in Asia . They expect it to hit the US in Jan/Feb where it will kill 6 out of 10 people. It HAS mutated. (Throw out the conspiracy theory) They will attempt a program of mandatory vaccinations but probably will not have enough time to enforce it. I will not be vaccinated. The last time they did mandatory vaccinations at least one person died and many others developed Guillain-Barre syndrome, which is a devastating illness.:They have not let the public know because they don't want people to panic, but to people who know, they are suggesting the following:Start stocking up on food now. They expect that martial law will be put into effect. You won't be able to go to work or shop for food -- you will be shot.Buy facial masks made by 3M - #N95.Use Purell obsessively. Oh, this is interesting: This pandemic was predicted years ago by a Russian mathematician. It's impetus was the Tsunami a few years ago. I know that by spreading this information I'm taking the risk of looking like an alarmist, but this is straight from the mouths of the CDC and Johns Hopkins.   Origins:   When the A(H1N1) virus, commonly known as the ""swine flu,"" was identified in April 2009, it quickly became a hot news topic and a subject of widespread discussion that prompted many people to seek out information about its causes, effects, rate of spread, methods of prevention or avoidance, etc.  The intense public interest in the U.S. has abated somewhat since then but will likely pick up as North America approaches its ""flu season"" of fall and winter.:Meanwhile, viral (no pun intended) e-mails on the subject of swine flu have continued to circulate; unfortunately, most of them are alarmist collections of unsubstantiated, exaggerated, or outright false information.   The item cited above is one example of such -- nearly every statement it contains falls into one of these classes:The CDC says H1N1 is currently wiping out entire villages in AsiaIf swine flu were truly wiping out ""entire villages in Asia,"" this would be a major event reported by news media around the world.  Yet no such reports have appeared either in the news or on the web site of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and the latest update from the World Health Organization (WHO) records only 1,154 confirmed H1N1-related deaths worldwide.  (The WHO's tracking chart of confirmed H1N1 deaths shows only one area with more than 10 deaths in all of Asia.)  They expect it to hit the US in Jan/Feb where it will kill 6 out of 10 people.The CDC has not made any statement to the effect that it expects swine flu to kill 60% of the U.S. population (or even 60% of the U.S. residents who contract it).  The A(H1N1) virus has been classified as ""relatively mild"" since it was first detected in April 2009, and the CDC simply notes that swine flu activity in the U.S. is expected to increase as winter approaches, with the potential for the disease to -- in addition to other viruses -- cause significant illness (including, in some cases, death)::Given ongoing novel H1N1 activity to date, CDC anticipates that there will be more cases, more hospitalizations and more deaths associated with this pandemic in the United States over the summer and into the fall and winter. The novel H1N1 virus, in conjunction with regular seasonal influenza viruses, poses the potential to cause significant illness with associated hospitalizations and deaths during the U.S. influenza season.Even in the absence of an effective vaccine, the WHO's current projections estimate only that one out of every three persons worldwide might contract swine flu over the next two years, resulting in ""thousands of deaths"" among a group of 2 billion people -- nowhere near the 60% mortality rate claimed above.  It HAS mutated.To the contrary, as of late August 2009 the CDC was still reporting that the H1N1 flu strain was not mutating:The H1N1 flu strain doesn't appear to be mutating as it makes its way through the Southern Hemisphere, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a briefing.One of the biggest fears has been that the virus, which first appeared in April in the U.S. and Mexico and which people don't have any built-up immunity to, might mutate into an even more dangerous form. Health officials have been keeping a close watch on the Southern Hemisphere, which is in its winter season now, to see what form of the virus is likely to travel north as fall comes to the U.S. and the rest of the Northern Hemisphere.Flu viruses are unpredictable, so the fact that this one hasn't mutated is ""somewhat reassuring"" said Jay Butler, director of CDC's H1N1 Vaccine Task Force.Case numbers in the Southern Hemisphere appear to be dropping, he said.:They will attempt a program of mandatory vaccinations but probably will not have enough time to enforce it.A swine flu vaccine is not expected to be widely available in the U.S. until mid-October 2009.  Although Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Kathleen Sebelius announced in July 2009 that the federal government expects to initiate a swine flu vaccination program in the fall, she also stated that the program would be voluntary, not mandatory:Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius told [attendees of a flu summit] that they should prepare for a mass vaccination program this fall, the start of the traditional U.S. flu season.""While we have made no final decisions about its scope, and have 'off ramps' built into our decision-making process if the circumstances change, at this point, we expect to initiate a voluntary fall vaccination program against the 2009 H1N1 flu virus,"" Mrs. Sebelius said. ""This will depend on the availability of a safe vaccine and the absence of changes in the virus that would render the vaccine ineffective.""The last time they did mandatory vaccinations at least one person died and many others developed Guillain-Barre syndrome, which is a devastating illness.:This statement is presumably a reference to the 1976 Swine flu vaccination program, known as the National Influenza Immunization Program (NIIP).  Although a causal connection was never definitively established, the possibility that the vaccine might have resulted in an increased incidence of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), an inflammatory disorder in which the body's immune system attacks part of the peripheral nervous system, was one of the factors that led to the termination of the program:What NIIP did not and could not survive was finding cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) among persons receiving swine flu immunizations. As of 1976, >50 ""antecedent events"" had been identified in temporal relationship to GBS, events that were considered as possible factors in its cause. The list included viral infections, injections, and ""being struck by lightning."" Whether or not any of the antecedents had a causal relationship to GBS was, and remains, unclear. When cases of GBS were identified among recipients of the swine flu vaccines, they were, of course, well covered by the press. Because GBS cases are always present in the population, the necessary public health questions concerning the cases among vaccine recipients were ""Is the number of cases of GBS among vaccine recipients higher than would be expected? And if so, are the increased cases the result of increased surveillance or a true increase?"" Leading epidemiologists debated these points, but the consensus, based on the intensified surveillance for GBS (and other conditions) in recipients of the vaccines, was that the number of cases of GBS appeared to be an excess.:It should be noted, however, that the primary reason for the termination of the NIIP was that the feared swine flu epidemic it was intended to combat never occurred.  Had there been a swine flu epidemic, the benefits of timely vaccinations would have far outweighed the relatively small risks: Had H1N1 influenza been transmitted at that time, the small apparent risk of GBS from immunization would have been eclipsed by the obvious immediate benefit of vaccine-induced protection against swine flu. However, in December 1976, with >40 million persons immunized and no evidence of H1N1 transmission, federal health officials decided that the possibility of an association of GBS with the vaccine, however small, necessitated stopping immunization, at least until the issue could be explored.Since a current swine flu vaccine has yet to be put through clinical trials and rolled out to large numbers of people, no one could possibly know what connection (if any) there might be between such a vaccine and GBS.  Moreover, it's something of a logical disconnect to assert that a particular contagion is going to cause the death of 60% of the population, yet suggest people should avoid being vaccinated for it because of a minuscule chance that taking the vaccine might result in the recipient's contracting a different illness.  :They have not let the public know because they don't want people to panic. They expect that martial law will be put into effect. These types of statements are commonly found (almost verbatim) in all manner of unsubstantiated, alarmist e-mails, covering scenarios fromY2K-related chaos to the United States' surrendering its sovereignty to the United Nations. We have yet to encounter a single case in which such statements proved to be true.  This is straight from the mouths of the CDC and Johns Hopkins.As noted above, neither the CDC (nor Johns Hopkins) has issued any such statements as the ones claimed above.Rather than relying on and disseminating misinformation about swine flu passed along through anonymous, unsourced e-mails, we'd advise readers to obtain their information from reputable public health agencies such as the CDC and the WHO.

42,42,42,567.NoTuckerCarlsonDidnt,"Claim:Tucker Carlson revealed credible evidence of widespread voter fraud in Georgia.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Six months after a disinformation campaign pushed by former U.S. President Donald Trump and his supporters alleging mass-scale voter fraud incited a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Fox News host Tucker Carlson took to his show to again promote similar claims.:In the lead-up to and aftermath of the 2020 election, Trump and his supporters falsely claimed the election was ""stolen"" by means of a massive voter fraud conspiracy, but never presented evidence for these claims that withstood scrutiny. Trump's own Department of Homeland Security stated that the 2020 election, which took place during a pandemic, was, in fact, ""the most secure in American history."" Georgia's ballots have been counted three times.None of the lawsuits put forward by Trump or his supporters were successful in court and in fact, Trump's attorney in the matter, Rudy Giuliani, had his law license suspended for spreading election lies.Despite the fact that there is no evidence for claims of mass voter fraud and even though those claims have led to deadly violence, Carlson persisted in promoting them.The segment that aired on July 14, 2021, contained various claims that have either been already debunked, or are statements based on supposition and lack evidence. (We note that Carlson's employer, Fox News, argued in a court case that Carlson's show shouldn't be viewed as factual.):During his July 14 primetime show, Carlson stated, ""It now appears there actually was meaningful voter fraud in Fulton County, Georgia last November."" He later added, ""That is not a conspiracy theory. It's true.""Carlson's July 14 segment cited the findings of an activist group called VoterGA. The group supports Trump's false claims of massive election fraud and has embarked on a search for evidence of said fraud.Here's how Georgia Public Broadcasting described the group:The primary plaintiff is Garland Favorito of the group VoterGA, who has fought against Georgia's elections infrastructure for more than a decade, including a failed lawsuit against Georgia's old direct-recording electronic machines. Favorito has also questioned the authenticity of events surrounding 9/11, pushed conspiracy theories about former President Bill Clinton and the assassination of John F. Kennedy and is now serving as the latest vessel for false claims of fraud with the 2020 election.We will now look at the claims Carlson made on his show.:The Alarm at the Fulton County Election WarehouseThe segment opened with a weeks-old piece of disinformation about an alarm sounding at an election warehouse in Fulton County. Carlson stated:On a Saturday night in late May of this year, an alarm sounded in a big nondescript warehouse in Fulton County, Georgia. The warehouse was an unlikely place for a burglary. It was under round-the-clock surveillance by both private security and local law enforcement including armed deputies with the Fulton County Sheriff's Office.Any unauthorized person entering from the outside would have to get past a locked 100-pound steel door, as well as a maze of motion detectors -- not easy -- but someone tried to do it, anyway and at just the perfect moment, 20 minutes after the deputies in charge of guarding the warehouse left their posts.By the time those deputies returned to check out the alarm, someone had opened the 100-pound door to the warehouse. So, what happened that night? And why? We still don't know.:In fact, we do know.Georgia Public Broadcasting reporter Stephen Fowler took to Twitter to point out that not only did Carlson use a photograph taken by Fowler without crediting him, the photograph was lifted from a story that explains why an alarm went off and what happened with the door.:Fowler reported in June 2021 that the alarm didn't come from the area where ballots were secured.""The source of the alarm was a motion detector in an upstairs office belonging to the Clerk of Superior Court in the warehouse, and the county said a test showed that alarm is audible from where the private security officers were stationed off property.""As for who opened the door, it was law enforcement.Fowler reported that two off-duty Douglas County Sheriff's officers in a marked patrol car approached the warehouse and found the outer door unlocked.""The officers opened it themselves, and it was not 'left wide open,'"" as pro-Trump media had reported at the time, Fowler explained in the report.'Double-Scanned Ballot' Claim:Carlson claimed VoterGA found double-scanned ballots accounted for more than 3,300 votes for President Joe Biden and 865 votes for Trump. But there's no evidence thousands of double-scanned ballots were reflected in Georgia's official vote tally.""Surveillance footage obtained by VoterGA appears to show large numbers of ballots being scanned multiple times,"" Carlson stated. In this segment, Carlson directed viewers' attention to a woman wearing a yellow shirt in a video he said was obtained by VoterGA.But that video doesn't prove that the state's election results were falsified by ballots scanned multiple times, and importantly, Georgia's election results were recounted after the election, including by hand. That means that if any ballots were scanned more than once, in order for it to end up in the final vote tally, those ballots would have needed to have been counted more than once in both the heavily-scrutinized machine recounts and in the hand counts of the ballots.The video used by Carlson was from a surveillance camera at State Farm Arena in Atlanta, where ballots were being processed on the night of the election. Investigators looked into allegations of fraud at that time and found no evidence of wrongdoing.:The closest Carlson came to offering an independent source for the figures he regurgitated from VoterGA was a July 13 report by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC). In doing so, not only did Carlson acknowledge that VoterGA is a problematic source on its own, he also misrepresented the Journal-Constitution's report. Carlson stated:Now before you dismiss [attorney] Bob Cheeley and Voter GA as dishonest partisan actors, keep in mind that the strongly left of center ""Atlanta Journal Constitution"" appears to agree with this at least in outline. The newspaper reviewed the available digital ballot images independently and concluded that hundreds of ballots were improperly duplicated.The AJC didn't report that ""hundreds"" of ballots were improperly duplicated. It reported that ""nearly 200"" ballots were scanned twice before a recount. An important part of the AJC report left out by Carlson was that there was ""no indication any vote for president was counted more than once in official results.""The newspaper, which offered readers the opportunity to look at ballot images themselves, further reported::The ballots counted twice would have given Biden 31 extra votes. After a recount, official results reflected that Trump gained a total of 121 absentee votes in Fulton. Biden won the county with 73% of 524,000 votes cast.The Atlanta Journal-Constitution also verified the duplicate ballots in ballot images obtained under the Georgia Open Records Act and posted online.Although it's true that a small number of ballots were duplicated in Fulton County, the numbers are nowhere near as large as Carlson claimed; and contrary to what Carlson stated, the amount wouldn't have changed the outcome of the presidential election.'Seven Falsified Audit Tally Sheets' Had 'Fabricated Vote Totals'The source for this assertion is a July 13 news release posted by VoterGA which claimed that the group found ""7 falsified audit tally sheets containing fabricated vote totals for their respective batches."" :This claim originated with a comparison made by VoterGA between ballot batches from the initial election machine count to ballot batches from the state's manual recount and audit, per Mark Niesse, reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution who has covered the election and its aftermath.But a discrepancy between those two numbers is not evidence of fabricated vote totals or even of wrongdoing. At this time, we don't know how election workers sorted and counted ballots.But Niesse pointed out that neither the initial count nor the audit were the the official, certified vote totals for the presidential race. The official results came from the machine recount requested by Trump. He also pointed out that the official tally closely matched the initial count.'None of the Ballots Had Any Creases on Them""Carlson cited a ""whistleblower"" who stated she saw mail-in ballots without creases on them. :""That's strange because of course mail-in ballots need to be bent in order to be mailed in,"" Carlson observed.Georgia election official Gabriel Sterling explained this to The New York Times in an interview published Jan. 4 about false election fraud claims being promoted by Trump and his supporters:TRUMP'S CLAIM: That officials improperly counted ""pristine"" ballots -- meaning ballots that weren't folded, indicating that they hadn't arrived in an envelope.STERLING'S EXPLANATION: ""Pristine"" ballots aren't unusual, Mr. Sterling said. For instance, many military and overseas voters receive electronic ballots that they print out, complete and mail back. But these printed ballots aren't the right size for scanners, so election workers have a standard process for transferring the votes to scannable ballots. A ballot that gets damaged and can't be scanned may be transferred in the same way.The Claim That Voters Moved:""""Nearly 35,000 Georgia voters moved out of their county of residence more than a month prior to election day,"" Carlson said. ""They were ineligible to vote. And yet they did.""This claim comes from a July 12 story published by the pro-Trump website The Federalist. Although the article cites an ""expert in voter data analytics and residency issues"" named Mark Davis, it doesn't link to his work. It only reports that he compared two different databases, the U.S. Postal Service national change of address database and data from the Georgia Secretary of State's Office, and came up with a figure: 35,000 Georgians registered a change of address but voted in their old county.But The Federalist admitted the reason for this isn't known and it may be perfectly legitimate in most cases:While some of those nearly 35,000 voters may have been students, members of the military, or may have only relocated temporarily--situations which do not affect an individual's residency for purposes of election law--everyone else in this group voted illegally under Georgia law. Now we are seeing from Davis' further research that as of May 2021, more than 10,300 of those individuals have updated their voter registration to their new address, thereby confirming that the move they had previously informed the USPS of was permanent.:Insinuating that there were 10,300 votes cast by people illegally is pure supposition, however. No evidence is offered that this number, if accurate, represents 10,300 illegally cast votes. About that, The Washington Post reported that ""If true -- again, this is unproven third-party analysis -- it's illegal in the sense that going 67 in a 65 is illegal, not in the sense that you're driving a stolen car."""
43,43,43,691.WillaDoomsdayAsteroi,"Claim:NASA is lying about the path of a recently discovered asteroid, and it will actually cause widespread destruction when it hits Earth in February 2017.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 25 January 2017, the Daily Mail published a report with the terrifying headline: ""A doomsday asteroid will hit Earth next month and trigger devastating mega-tsunamis, claims conspiracy theorist"". If ever you wanted a textbook example of the balance fallacy (when two sides of an argument are represented as having comparable value regardless of their merits), or of revenue-driven, shameless pseudoscientific clickbait, this would be the place to see it in the wild.:On one side of the debate you have NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. It is a large collection of professionally trained scientists, some of whom have spent decades specifically studying the science of asteroid tracking, engineers who are trained to operate multi-million dollar instruments to perform said tracking, and offices whose sole purpose is to monitor the trajectory of near earth objects. This organization's NEOWISE mission detected an object dubbed 2016 WF9 on 27 November 2016. After collecting enough data on its orbit, they reported that it was no threat to Earth on 29 December 2016:2016 WF9 will approach Earth's orbit on Feb. 25, 2017. At a distance of nearly 32 million miles (51 million kilometers) from Earth, this pass will not bring it particularly close. The trajectory of 2016 WF9 is well understood, and the object is not a threat to Earth for the foreseeable future.On the other side of the debate (as framed by the Daily Mail), you have ""Self-proclaimed Russian astronomer Dr Dyomin Damir Zakharovich"" who says NASA is lying, and that it will hit Earth on 16 February 2017::'The object they call WF9 left the Nibiru system in October when Nibiru began spinning counter clockwise around the sun,' he said.'Since then, Nasa has known it will hit Earth. But they are only telling people now.'If the asteroid hit Earth, he says, it could destroy cities or cause a tsunami. 'We are all in peril.'The UK tabloid Metro also reported on this mysterious astronomer:Dr Zakharovich believes that there's a global conspiracy to conceal the existence of Nibiru - orchestrated by the leaders of Russia and the West.Two quick notes on the Zakharovich hypothesis. The ""Nibiru system"" refers to an as yet undetected planet in the outer reaches of our solar system, whose name is rooted in a misreading of ancient Babylonian texts, and which has been the basis for myriad predictions (many of which have come and gone) of our civilization's ultimate demise. While an undetected planet may well exist in our solar system, there is a fairly specific area in which it would be found, and nothing leaving that distant region of space in October is going to be hitting us this February -- even if it were on the right trajectory.:Second, even the Daily Mail seems to think the man on whom  they have based their entire article may not exist:The name 'Dyomin Damir Zakharovich' seems to have only appeared online in recent months, relating to doomsday reports regarding the fictional planet Nibiru.What we do know for sure, though, is that all available data suggests it is not a risk to our planet. That data is sufficient enough for NASA to have mapped out a Lonely Planet-caliber tour guide for its trip through the inner solar system:It's in an orbit that takes it on a scenic tour of our solar system. At its farthest distance from the sun, it approaches Jupiter's orbit. Over the course of 4.9 Earth-years, it travels inward, passing under the main asteroid belt and the orbit of Mars until it swings just inside Earth's own orbit. After that, it heads back toward the outer solar system. Objects in these types of orbits have multiple possible origins; it might once have been a comet, or it could have strayed from a population of dark objects in the main asteroid belt.:"

Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.During a violence-filled weekend of protests by supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones made statements about Trump's soon-to-be successor, President-elect Joe Biden, which some observers interpreted as a threat.:The statement by Jones, who runs the conspiracy trolling network Infowars, was made on Dec. 12, 2020, during a rally in Washington, D.C. by Trump supporters protesting the results of the presidential election, which they claimed was rife with fraud. Four people were stabbed and one person was shot during the weekend's protests. Dozens were arrested.""I don't know who's going to the White House in 38 days but I sure know this,"" Jones screamed into a microphone. ""Joe Biden is a globalist, and Joe Biden will be removed one way or another.""The commentary was captured on video and posted to Twitter by journalist Zachary Petrizzo:: Jones is a longtime and prolific promoter of conspiracy theories on his Infowars platform, which he also uses to hawk herbal supplements. He has been sued by the family members of the young children murdered by a mass shooter at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, for aggressively promoting the narrative that the shooting was a hoax.The conspiracy theory promoted by Jones resulted in the families of those children being targeted with death threats, stalking, and harassment from Jones's followers. At least two people have been arrested for crimes associated with harassing victims' families because of the hoax conspiracy theory.The term ""globalist"" is a reference to an overarching conspiracy theory often promoted by Jones which posits that a secret cabal of powerful people is plotting to subvert U.S. sovereignty. The word is often used as an anti-Semitic slur.:Trump's own administration has undermined Trump's persistent claims that the election, which he lost by an estimated 7 million votes and 74 electoral college points, was fraudulent, stating that it was in fact the most secure election in American history.Nevertheless, Trump and his supporters have continued to push the false claim, even as various public officials targeted by his ire have stated that resulting anger from Trump's supporters against them is growing more threatening and potentially violent."

Results determined that they tested positive for at least 11 pathogens, some of which are common human flora and/or commonly found in soil and water. The findings were not the result of a regimented, peer-reviewed study, however, and do not support the conclusion that wearing masks could be doing more harm than good. Because there was no standardization in collecting the samples, the results did not indicate to what extent masks may collect harmful pathogens. :Snopes is still fighting an ""infodemic"" of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

In June 2021, a research facility at the University of Florida tested six masks worn by children during their school day and found that at least 11 disease-causing pathogens were present on the mask material. Following publication of the results by Florida newspaper Alachua Chronicle, a COVID-19 conspiracy theory Facebook group called PANDA promoted the findings as evidence in a June 18 post to suggest that wearing masks could be doing more harm than good, as did politically conservative websites like Town Hall and the conspiracy theory-promoting website Rational Ground. In an email to Snopes, the University of Florida confirmed that a laboratory affiliated with the college had conducted the lab test, but that the institution did not have plans to release the report. :""The University of Florida Mass Spectrometry Research and Education Center routinely conducts lab tests for members of the public as requested, as it did for Ms. Donoho. However, it is important to note that we had no way of establishing the chain of custody for these masks and to what conditions they were exposed prior to the lab test,"" a spokesperson told Snopes. ""To draw any conclusions is premature and a more controlled, peer-reviewed research is warranted. It is also important to note that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention studies indicate wearing a mask is among the most effective measures for preventing and mitigating the spread of COVID-19.""Snopes spoke with Kari Basso, director of the Mass Spectrometry Research and Education Center at the University of Florida (MSREC), who tested the masks and shared the findings with us directly. Before we go into the details of Basso's conclusions, it is important to note that what she found was not the result of a standardized study, nor have the findings been published in a peer-reviewed journal. Furthermore, some medical experts have expressed concern over how the study was conducted and how the results were used to question the safety and efficacy of wearing masks. The World Health Organization described the findings as a ""pseudo-study."" :MRSEC is a service facility where anyone can send samples for analysis. In particular, Basso employs the use of proteomics, a study of the expression of genes that uses the structure and function of their proteins to sequence genomic data. A method known as liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is used to analyze microorganisms like bacteria by extracting proteins, treating each with an enzyme to cut the protein into smaller fragments, and then measuring these fragments in such a way that the sequence is determined. Bacterial species can be detected at the strain level to identify microorganisms at all taxonomic levels, according to a 2015 study published in the journal Systematic and Applied Microbiology. LC-MS/MS is different than the traditional culturing of bacteria, which takes a sample of bacterial cells and multiplies microbial organisms to determine what types are present. Basso instructed parents to put a fresh mask on their children. At the end of the day, they were told to put it in a zip-closed bag and place it in the freezer. A 1-centimeter square was cut from the center region of two cotton-based masks, a neck-gaiter, a T-shirt, and three surgical masks. These samples were compared against three blank masks (fresh and not worn) that were provided as a control sample. From the 1-centimeter squares, a sample was cut into smaller pieces before being placed overnight in a solution to extract the proteins.  :The small-scale study did not differentiate the inside of the mask from the outside, so it is impossible to say whether the bacteria came from the skin and saliva of the child wearing the mask, or whether the mask had been contaminated through external contact. And because Basso did not directly oversee how the parents collected the mask samples, it is unclear at what point in the process they may have become contaminated. Simply put, Basso was able to determine what pathogens were present on the masks but not how they came to be there.Below were some of the highlighted bacteria found on the masks and the conditions they can cause, according to the lab results:PathogenDescriptionAcinetobacter baumanniCommonly found in soil and water and can cause infections in the blood, urinary tract, and lungs. Infections typically occur in people in healthcare settings and the bacteria can spread from one person to another through contact with contaminated surfaces.Streptococcus pyogenesA common bacterium that can cause strep throat, rheumatic fever, scarlet fever, and other skin infections. Streptococcal bacteria can spread through the respiratory droplets of an infected person or via shared food or drinks.:Porphyromonas gingivalisThis bacterium can live in the oral cavities of people and is common in individuals with poor oral hygiene or periodontal diseaseStaphylococcus aureusStaphylococcus bacteria is found on the skin and in the nose of healthy individuals but in some cases can cause skin infections ranging from minor boils to endocardium, a life-threatening condition of the heart. Staph bacteria are also one of the most common causes of food poisoning.Neisseria meningitidisMeningitidis bacteria are common and responsible for nearly 90% of disease caused by that bacterial species worldwide. The bacteria is found in the nose and throat of about one in 10 people without causing illness. When it invades the body, the bacteria can cause serious disease.Rickettsia rickettsiiR. rickettsia is the bacterial agent responsible for Rocky Mountain spotted fever, a disease that is only spread through the bite of an infected tick.Corynebacterium diphtheriaeDiphtheria is a serious infection caused by strains of this bacteria, however, most public school systems require childhood vaccination that protects against infection.:Legionella pneumophilaLegionella bacteria are naturally found in freshwater environments but can cause an infection when they grow and spread in human-made water systems like showerheads, hot tubs, and plumbing systems. People can contract a serious lung infection known as Legionnaires' disease when they breathe in small droplets of water that contain the bacteria. Despite hyperbolized accounts of the above bacteria in media reports, a majority of the pathogens are common and rarely cause severe illness or disease. And as the study itself noted, not all bacteria are harmful or pathogenic -- many of those listed in the above table are part of the human flora on skin, saliva, or in the gut, and are natural to the environment in soil and water. In several of the samples, the most abundant proteins detected are human proteins found in saliva and skin. So while the listed pathogens can be dangerous, their detected presence alone isn't enough to suggest that wearing masks may present an increased risk of exposure to deadly diseases. :Basso told Snopes that she was ""shocked"" by her results and that they present an opportunity for further study, but that it is not within her expertise to determine if it is factual to say that wearing masks does more harm than good. As of this writing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that those who are not fully vaccinated or who have a condition that may weaken their immune system should continue to wear masks in public."
46,46,46,271.WomanStandsbyDescrip,"Lynne Knowles didn't expect a Facebook Live video she made about getting followed by a strange man in a grocery store to rack up millions of views, but the Pinellas County, Florida, resident's warning to friends wound up being a viral sensation.Knowles posted the video on 17 September 2018, warning women that she had seen men lurking around parking lots, and that one man had gone so far as stalk her as she shopped at a Publix grocery store near her home in August. ""Be very careful,"" she warned. ""Ladies, tell your daughters. Men, tell your daughters they've got to be careful coming in and out of parking lots. They've got to be very aware of their surroundings and carry their keys in their hands. If nothing else, have a head set on because it at least looks like you're hooked up to a phone and can call 911 immediately"": :As a result of the video, Knowles has been featured in a number of local news stories, some of which reported that local police countered perhaps her most explosive comment: that the incidents she described were evidence that human trafficking was afoot in Pinellas County.""There's human trafficking going on,"" Knowles said in the video. ""There are men posted all over parking lots, they're following women and they're trying to grab them."" (The video, captioned, ""PLEASE BE AWARE OF THE DANGER OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING!!"", had been shared a quarter of a million times and viewed by 8.3 million people as of 19 September 2018, just two days after it was posted.)Pinellas County Sheriff's Sgt. Spencer Gross told us police have seen no evidence of a rash of attempted kidnappings or human trafficking activity in the area. He said Knowles didn't report the incident in which she was followed in the grocery store to police, but he added that investigators are trying to track down the other encounters described in the video: ""We arrested a guy two weeks ago who followed a woman into a restaurant bathroom and recorded her. We do have creepers, and we do investigate those. Are we seeing an increase? I wouldn't say an increase but we do get those complaints."":Some Facebook users accused Knowles of spreading hoaxes and ""fake news."" Others poked fun at her or criticized her for promoting ""hysteria."" For her part, Knowles told us she didn't report the Publix incident because after she confronted the man, he stopped following her.Knowles said that after she posted her video, multiple women reached out to her to relay similar experiences. ""I'm grateful for the literally millions of people who have reached out and said thank you,"" Knowles told us in a phone interview. While she has received some negative feedback, ""the good much outweighs the bad.""Knowles told us she stands by every incident she described and maintained that while it may not be human trafficking, women are definitely experiencing scary incidents: ""I can't tell you exactly what's going on but it's happened multiple times. When you live somewhere and you know six or seven people who have the same experience -- I was trying to warn my friends, I had no idea it would ever go viral.""One incident happened the same day Knowles posted the video, she said, when an older woman entered the Earth Origins health food store she was shopping at and reported she had been followed by a man through a parking lot who he tried to accost her. ""She was scared to death,"" Knowles recounted in the video. ""She's a trauma nurse, she told me, and she said she's never been so scared in her life. I understand because I was rattled by what happened at Publix."":What happened to Knowles is hardly unusual. According to a February 2018 study on sexual harassment and assault lead by the non-profit organization Stop Street Harassment, the vast majority of women, some 81 percent, have experienced some form of sexual harassment and/or assault in their lifetimes, and 34 percent of women reported they have been followed. Furthermore, public spaces (such as grocery stores) are where sexual harassment most frequently occurs, according to the study. Most sexual harassment is perpetrated by male strangers, and a third of women reported experiencing anxiety or depression after such incidents.Holly Kearl, executive director of Stop Street Harassment, told us Knowles' concerns for women's safety are legitimate. In an email, she stated that ""these are common and very scary occurrences for women,"" adding that ""If a woman has had this kind of experience and/or if she's heard about men attacking, kidnapping, raping or killing women in their area, they will feel less safe and more wary of any man they don't know who approaches them.""The term ""human trafficking"" refers to ""modern-day slavery and ""involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion to obtain some type of labor or commercial sex act."" Although victims of human trafficking come from an array of backgrounds, they are often recruited from socially-vulnerable groups. Many victims are migrants, and roughly a quarter of the world's 40.3 million trafficking victims are children. :According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security:[Traffickers] look for people who are susceptible for a variety of reasons, including psychological or emotional vulnerability, economic hardship, lack of a social safety net, natural disasters, or political instability. The trauma caused by the traffickers can be so great that many may not identify themselves as victims or ask for help, even in highly public settings.It's no surprised Knowles initially suspected her safety concerns were related to human trafficking, because the term has been rocketing around the Internet, although it is often employed in the service of bogus conspiracy theories. The Pizzagate conspiracy theory perhaps most famously (and falsely) accused 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and other prominent Democrats of running a child trafficking ring out of a basement at a Washington, D.C. pizza restaurant (which actually has no basement).Since the Pizzagate phenomenon, similarly outlandish claims have been fed into cyberspace, including a June 2018 incident in which a group of men stumbled into what they claimed to be a ""bunker"" used for child sex trafficking. Police investigated and determined the ""bunker"" was nothing more than an abandoned homeless encampment. (Child trafficking is also a key component to the far-fetched but popular fabrication that is the Qanon conspiracy theory.):Regardless of terminology, Knowles said the reason she posted her video was to warn women to be careful and had no ill intent. ""The video speaks for itself and the intent was only to bring good and awareness to people. That's all."""
47,47,47,50.WasGinaHaspelFoundDe,"Claim:CIA Director Gina Haspel was found dead in November 2020. Rating:FalseAbout this rating In November 2020, rumors circulated about the whereabouts of CIA Director Gina Haspel. An article reproduced on the conspiratorial Rumor Mill News, for example, claimed that Haspel was arrested for treason. Others claimed that Haspel had been found dead from natural causes. :Both of these rumors are unsubstantiated and are built upon a debunked conspiracy theory about a fictional raid on an election software company in Germany.In the days following the 2020 election, the internet was flooded with conspiracy theories that falsely claimed the election was rigged or fraudulent in some manner. One of the more outlandish theories held that an election software company in Germany had been used to alter the vote tallies in the United States.This theory reached a wide audience after Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas said during a Zoom call that U.S. Army forces had seized servers from the software company Scytl in Frankfurt, Germany. Gohmert also said that his information was based on a tweet and that he did not know the truth, yet conspiracy theorists picked up this thread and ran with it. On Nov. 15, 2020, The Associated Press published an article investigating the rumor, which they determined to be false::CLAIM: The U.S. Army raided the Frankfurt office of the Spanish election software company Scytl to seize servers that had evidence of voting irregularities in the Nov. 3 U.S. election.AP'S ASSESSMENT: False. Both the Army and Scytl told The Associated Press the claim is not true. Furthermore, Scytl does not have offices or servers in Frankfurt, Germany.THE FACTS: Social media users Saturday were sharing reports published by conservative websites claiming servers that would reveal wrongdoing in the U.S. election had been confiscated by U.S. military forces in Germany. Most posts said the servers belong to the software company Scytl, which is based in Barcelona, and some suggested the servers housed information from Dominion Voting Systems.Although this raid did not happen, that didn't stop conspiracy theorists. On Nov. 29, Rumor Mill News reproduced an article (it's not entirely clear where the article originated, but it appears to come from a ""Q drop"" -- an unsourced rumor penned by a person cosplaying as a government official) claiming that Haspel had been severely injured during this raid and that she was then airlifted to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp (GITMO) where she was arrested for treason.  :That article, which misspells Haspel's name numerous times, reads in part:CIA Director Gina Hasple was arrested after she was injured in the Frankfurt Germany CIA building raid to secure the servers.The building had no guards and was unprotected. Hasple pulled in some private special military trained security forces to protect the building from such a suspected raid. When the raid happened Hasple was there......The CIA made up a cover story about the 5 soldiers and one cia operative killed and said they were killed in a helicopter crash.Hasple was air evacuated out. She was flown to GITMO where she was treated and received a tribunal for treason. She agreed to help trump for a lighter sentence of life which can be revoked if she chooses to not cooperate. She has now turned over information on the servers, what they were for and what they did and who was involved.Shortly after this article was published, another rumor started to circulate about Haspel claiming that the CIA director had been ""found dead"" of ""natural causes,"" which led to speculation that the government had actually killed Haspel and that they were now covering up her death. :Some social media users also came across an alleged obituary for Haspel. This obituary, however, was not published by a credible national news organization, or even the local newspaper of Haspel's hometown in Ashland, Kentucky. Rather, this ""obituary"" -- which simply took the aforementioned conspiratorial postings as truth and provided no additional confirmation -- was published on Dec. 1 on deaddeath.com, a website that has previously published premature obituaries based on fake news. For example, they wrote an obituary for ""Carolyn Gombell,"" a non-existent woman featured in a fictional story about U.S. President Donald Trump being a murderer.These rumors about Haspel's death did not originate with credible sources and no evidence has been provided to support them. These rumors stem from a debunked story about a fictional raid on a German software company. As such, we've marked this rumor as ""False."" "

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. Efforts by social media platforms to clean up dangerous English-language misinformation are not being replicated in other languages, notably Spanish, which can have detrimental and even deadly consequences for the platforms' users, advocates say.Election misinformation can spark violence and suppress voter turnout, while COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation can cost lives. But Carmen Scurato, associate legal director and senior counsel for the media and technology justice organization Free Press, told Snopes in a phone interview that advocates began to notice a gap in platform policy enforcement between English and Spanish that became apparent in the run-up to the November 2020 election.:That's when Facebook began stating it was removing content promoting ""militarized social movements,"" such as Qanon.""When we were checking, using Facebook's own search tools, we found the same content in Spanish, and that content hadn't been removed,"" Scurato said. ""We noticed that when content was being removed in English, the same content would stay up on Spanish. We would flag it for the company, and sometimes they would add a label, sometimes they would do nothing. We kept noticing this gap in moderation.""One year later, Free Press and other watchdogs were vindicated when Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen came forward with documents showing, as she stated before Congress, that Facebook's measures weren't being equally implemented:""Currently they are not keeping Spanish speakers safe at the level they do for English speakers. And that's unacceptable,"" she said.:Here's how the Los Angeles Times described the landscape of online misinformation in the lead-up to the 2020 election in a November 2021 report:Across the country, a pipeline of misleading media had been pumping lies and half-truths, in both English and Spanish, into local Latino communities. Sometimes the misinformation mirrored what the rest of the country was seeing: fear-mongering about mail-in ballots and antifa vigilantes, or conspiracy theories about the deep state and COVID-19. Other times it leaned into more Latino-specific concerns, such as comparing candidate Joe Biden to Latin American dictators or claiming that Black Lives Matter activists were using brujeria -- that is, witchcraft.According to Pew Research Center, when it comes to social media, people who identify themselves as Hispanic overwhelmingly use YouTube (85%) and Facebook (72%). Spanish speakers make up a sizable portion of the U.S. population. Spanish is the second most-spoken language in the U.S., with an estimated 41 million speakers.Jacobo Licona, a disinformation researcher for Equis Labs, a polling company that focuses on the Latino community, told Snopes by email that Latinos have a strong tendency to get their news on social media platforms.:""YouTube is a leading source of political news for Latinos, with 64% of registered Latino voters saying they got election information from YouTube,"" Licona stated. ""Latinos also spend twice as much time on YouTube as non-Latino adults. Relatedly, half of Latinos in the United States use WhatsApp, and Equis has found that Latinos who get their news from WhatsApp are most likely to express concern over socialism.""A common problem researchers see is cross-pollination of misinformation across platforms. Often, Scurato said, a video containing misinformation in Spanish will be posted on YouTube, then that video will be picked up and posted on Facebook or in WhatsApp chat channels. (WhatsApp is a chat platform owned by Meta, the parent company that owns Facebook and other popular platforms, including Instagram.)""There's a point,"" Scurato told us, ""where they [the platforms] just need to commit to enforcing their own policies and commit to enforcing them across all languages."":One Facebook post dated April 15, 2021, viewed by Snopes and archived here, spread the debunked conspiracy theory that billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates was using the COVID-19 vaccines to plant microchips in people. The post also imbued the vaccines with apocalyptic religious implications.""Bill Gates is promoting the antichrist vaccine for all nations to then implement the mandatory vaccination certificate, which means a collection of biometric data from each inhabitant, this through a microchip called ID 2020 that would be the mark of the beast,"" the Facebook post read in Spanish.As of Dec. 13, 2021, the post was still live and contained no label marking it as misinformation.Kevin McAlister, a spokesperson for Meta (Facebook's parent company), told Snopes in an email that of the 10 third-party fact-checkers the company contracts with, four fact-check content in Spanish.:Furthermore, the company stated, Spanish is one of the ""highest resourced languages"" when it comes to content review, as one of the most commonly used languages by its platform users. Meta employs U.S.-based, native Spanish-speaking content reviewers, while its artificial intelligence tools are constantly learning various slang and colloquialisms.Meta also stated it has ramped up its efforts to combat COVID-19 misinformation in Spanish. That includes state-specific information directed at users with platform settings in Spanish, and giving free ads to public health organizations -- like Johns Hopkins University, AARP, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services -- that direct legitimate pandemic-related health information to Spanish speakers.Elena Hernandez, a spokesperson for YouTube, told Snopes in an emailed statement:We work diligently to address misinformation on YouTube across dozens of languages. We enforce our Community Guidelines globally, and our automated systems flag violative videos in multiple languages. More than 20,000 people around the world, including many with Spanish and other non-English language expertise, work to detect, review and remove content that violates our policies. We also reduce recommendations of borderline content in every country we operate. Our efforts in this space are ongoing, we're always working to update our systems and improve the platform to prevent the spread of harmful misinformation.:But Haugen stated the issue isn't whether the platforms invest in Spanish-language content moderation; it's whether they invest enough.Dr. Ilan Shapiro, medical director for health education and wellness for AltaMed, a health care provider serving Los Angeles and Orange counties, said that he has noticed recent improvement in vaccination rates among his Spanish-speaking patients. Now, he said, most of his patients come to his clinic having already been vaccinated.He attributes the success to on-the-ground health education efforts by himself and other public health professionals.""I think that we're getting enough information to the community, so that they know if something [they see online] actually stinks,"" Shapiro told us by phone. His website and social media channels, where he posts as ""Dr. Shaps,"" are dedicated to educating people, primarily in Spanish, about the pandemic and vaccines.:But it's hard to keep up with online misinformation, he said, because it's constantly changing.""The most important part is to have conversations,"" he said. ""That's one of the most important things we need to have.""Despite the positive trend, the harm may have already been done. The pandemic has disproportionately impacted Latino communities. Reuters reported that election-related or political disinformation that flourished during the 2020 election cycle had the potential to affect the vote and even spark violence.""It's definitely neglect,"" Scurato said of the platforms' handling of the crisis, describing it as ""willful indifference for the safety of linguistically diverse communities.""Scurato said she believes there's an ""opportunity"" for Congress to draft regulations that ""require some high levels of transparency when it comes to this kind of content, and how they are enforcing their policies equitably."":"
49,49,49,116.WasaRussianNuclearEx,"Claim:Vyacheslav Ivanov, a former executive at Rosatom, was killed in a February 2018 plane crash as part of a ""deep state"" plot to cover up corruption by the Clintons.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In February 2018, just after a deadly plane crash in Russia, conspiracy theorists seized on a name among the rosters of those killed to claim that one of them was an executive at Russia's nuclear agency Rosatom; they further speculated that the incident was a CIA operation designed to silence individuals who could provide information that might be damaging to 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. :On 11 February 2018, Saratov Airlines flight 6W703 crashed near Moscow, killing all 71 people on board. Later that day, the meme emerged:Hi, I'm Vyacheslav Ivanov. Today I died in a plane crash in Russia. Oh, and I'm CFO of Rosatom. Uranium One? That part is just a coincidence. :Uranium One is the name of a mining company taken over by Rosatom in 2010, but also shorthand for a debunked conspiracy theory which alleges that Hillary Clinton, acting in her role as Secretary of State, singlehandedly transferred 20 percent of the United States' uranium reserves to Russia, as part of the Rosatom takeover of Uranium One. She did this, according to the conspiracy theory, in exchange for $145 million in donations from Uranium One investors to the Clinton Foundation. (We have previously debunked this.)On 11 February 2018, conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi appeared on the Alex Jones Show on InfoWars, to outline the new plane crash twist in the Uranium One saga:It turns out, on the plane crash there were several executives of Rosatom...One of the top ones was a gentleman named Ivanov, who ended up being the CFO of Rosatom...The suspicions are that it may have been a U.S. intelligence agency CIA hit, to kill these Rosatom executives to prevent them from testifying or being available to give testimony in the beginning enquiries on the whole Uranium One scandal, which I'm predicting will be the end of Robert Mueller's career. :Corsi did not name any executives other than Ivanov. The notorious fake news web site Neon Nettle also got in on the act, claiming the purported death of Vyacheslav Ivanov was proof of a cover-up of Clinton corruption: The ""Deep State"" now seems [to be] scrambling to remove any ""loose ends"" who might testify against the Clintons.The man shown in the meme is Vyacheslav Ivanov, who was chief financial officer of Rosatom until May 2017, according to his LinkedIn profile. There was also someone named Vyacheslav Ivanov killed on Flight 6W703, according to a list of names published by Russia's Ministry for Civil Defense, Emergencies, and Elimination of Consequences of Natural Disasters. However, they are not the same person. Firstly, the man killed on Flight 6W703 (Passenger #32) was born in 1986. In 1987, Rosatom's former chief financial officer Vyacheslav Ivanov began studying for a degree in Computers and Networks at the Moscow Institute of Radioelectronics, according to his LinkedIn profile; either the #QAnon crowd either missed this detail, did some extremely creative math and hoped no one would notice, or Ivanov is a genius the likes of which the world has never seen.:Unfortunately, the ""genius"" theory doesn't hold water, either. The former Rosatom CFO posted photographs of himself to Facebook on 12 February 2018, a day after the crash of Flight 6W703.The false Ivanov conspiracy theory was not the only one that spread online in the aftermath of the crash. Buzzfeed documented right-wing and conspiracy theorist web sites that claimed, also falsely, that Sergei Millian, a Belarussian-American businessman reported to be a source for the dossier at the heart of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign in the months leading up to the 2016 election, was also among the dead.  Russian authorities have not listed anyone by the name Sergei Millian as a passenger of Flight 6W703, and there is no evidence to support claims that Millian uses the alias ""Sergei Panchenko"" -- a name that actually does appear on the official list of passengers.

50,50,50,525.IsDisneysGoofyCharac,"Claim:The Disney cartoon character Goofy was modeled after a breed of Scottish cow.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Classic Disney cartoons have proved to be a consistent source of conspiracy theories, rumors, and urban legends. For instance, we've previously investigated claims that Winnie the Pooh was actually a girl (Mostly False), that the Seven Dwarfs were modeled on cocaine addiction (False) and that a topless woman could briefly be spotted in VHS copies of ""The Rescuers"" (True).:In January 2019, we encountered yet another Disney rumor: This time, the internet asked, is the Goofy cartoon character actually a cow rather than an (anthropomorphic) dog?Although this dog vs. cow debate wasn't entirely new in 2019, that time around it was supposedly supported by an ""investigative article"" published in 2012 by the website Reel Rundown. While that article did contain some factual information regarding the history of the Goofy character, which is likely the reason why some people have accepted it as a truthful account of Goofy's supposed sordid past, it is peppered with exaggerations, speculation, outright fabrications, and was clearly written with humorous intentions.Reel Rundown presented their argument as if they were uncovering a vast Disney conspiracy theory aimed at covering up Goofy's unsavory bovine heritage. In the introductory section, entitled ""Goofy Is Not a Dog -- The Cover Up,"" the author argued that Goofy was actually a foreign-born cow and that Disney was forced to conceal this fact due to the political climate in the 1930s::Goofy has always been thought of as a ""dog with human features"" according to Disney's Mouselinks. However what the Disney establishment isn't telling you is the goofy is really a cow. To be specific an Aberdeen-Angus Cattle. A fact that Disney would love to cover-up considering that Goofy's national origin is anything but American. In 1939 with American nationalism at an historic high, Goofy's true heritage could have created a huge scandal for Disney. A Scandal that would have finished Goofies [sic] career just as it was starting to take-off.""The next section, ""Goofy's Heritage Revealed,"" was even more outlandish. Reel Rundown imagined Goofy as a living, breathing, physical animal who was born ""Dipalwa Dawala"" to Egyptian immigrants in Scotland and was ""discovered by Disney talent scouts during a livestock sale."" During the ""Dark Years"" section of the article, the website upped the absurdity and claimed that Goofy's son died from Mad Cow disease.For those who took the time to read the article, it should have been obvious that it was a work of humorous fiction. However, it seems that some readers stopped at the headline and were left convinced that Goofy was actually a cow, not a dog:::Although this article was clearly written in jest, some of its curious claims have been spread in support of the ""Goofy is a cow"" argument. We'll dispel some of this misinformation to stop malicious propagation of rumors about this beloved Disney dog.Was Goofy ""born"" to Egyptian immigrants in Scotland and named ""Dipalwa Dawala?""First off, Goofy wasn't ""born"" anywhere: He was created by Disney animators Art Babbitt and Frank Webb in the 1930s. Goofy was introduced as a side character named ""Dippy Dawg"" in the cartoon short Mickey's Revue (1932) but underwent some revisions over the next few years. While Goofy has gone by a number of names during his Disney career (including Super Goof, Dippy Dawg, George G. Geef, Goofus D. Dawg, and Goofy Goof), we were unable to find any credible source listing the character as ""Dipalwa Dawala.""In fact, the only search results we could find for this term all point back to this Reel Rundown article. In other words, Goofy has never been named ""Dipalw Dawala."":Does Goofy's old love interest, Clarabelle the Cow, prove that Goofy is also a cow?Reel Rundown ended their humorous work of fiction with an ""evidence"" section claiming that Disney's history of creating same species couples (Mickey and Minnie, Donald and Daisy, etc.) pointed to Goofy's being a cow since he once had a love interest named Clarabele Cow:Goofy's love interest in the Mickey Mouse clubhouse is Clarabelle the Cow. The on-screen chemistry is obvious. Disney often couples characters with the opposite sex of the same species. Mickey and Mini, Donald and Daisey [sic] both follow this pattern. So why would the writers at Disney have Goofy and Clarabelle coupled up?While it's true that Goofy and Clarabelle Cow were once an item, this is not proof that they were the same species of animal. Clarabelle was the sometimes girlfriend of Horace Horsecollar, who was a horse and not a cow, and the Disney universe includes multiple examples of inter-species couples: Ben Ali Gator, for instance, woos Hyacinth Hippo in Fantasia; Jessica Rabbit (a cartoon human) has a rabbit husband in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog have an ongoing (if one-sided) relationship in the Muppet canon. Outside the Disney universe, Bimbo, a cartoon dog, was the occasional love interest of Betty Boop (a human female), and of course, Tillie Tiger once planted a kiss on Elmer Elephant::The Reel Rundown article was clearly a jape. However, it made us curious about Goofy's actual origins and whether the character was originally intended to represent a dog.:In Art Babbitt's character analysis of Goofy from 1934 (available via the website of animator Michael Sporn), Goofy is described as a ""composite of an everlasting optimist, a gullible Good Samaritan, a half-wit, a shiftless, good-natured coloured boy and a hick."" In his description of how Goofy should be drawn, Babbit mentioned two real-world creatures, neither of which was a cow:It is true that there is a vague similarity in the construction of the Goof's head and Pluto's. The use of the eyes, mouth and ears are entirely different. One is dog, the other human. The Goof's head can be thought of in terms of a caricature of a person with a pointed dome--large, dreamy eyes, buck teeth and weak chin, a large mouth, a thick lower lip, a fat tongue and a bulbous nose that grows larger on its way out and turns up. His eyes should remain partly closed to help give him a stupid, sloppy appearance, as though he were constantly straining to remain awake, but of course they can open wide for expressions or accents. He blinks quite a bit. His ears for the most part are just trailing appendages and are not used in the same way as Pluto's ears except for rare expressions. His brow is heavy and breaks the circle that outlines his skull.:A description of the character from Disney.go.com also compares Goofy to Pluto but notes that Goofy was created as more of a human character: ""Goofy was created as a human character, as opposed to Pluto, who was a pet, so he walked upright and had a speaking voice.""When we reached out to Disney for comment, a spokesperson told us that both The Disney Animation Research Library and the Walt Disney Archives agreed that Goofy was indeed an anthropomorphic dog. Erin Glover, Director of Publicity and Communications at Disney Animation, told us:The Disney Animation Research Library and the Walt Disney Archives agree that this question was best answered by Disney Legend Dave Smith: ""Goofy was originally created as a human character with dog-like characteristics, thus why he walks upright, wears clothes, talks and has animal features that resemble a dog."" :"

The man wearing a backpack in the photograph is Vinay Krishnan, a consultant who helps organize legal support for the progressive activist organization Center for Popular Democracy (an organization that has been heavily involved in organizing protests against Kavanaugh's confirmation).Krishnan told us the money was raised via small donations from around the country, and protesters were given about $35 to pay related fees in the event they were arrested; if they weren't arrested, the money was to be returned.""These protesters are coming from across the country believing they are fighting for their very right to exist in this country,"" he told us. ""That's why they're there. Not for $35 which they returned immediately if they didn't give it to D.C. Capitol Police.""Both Lampron and Krishnan faced online harassment as a result of the misinformation spread online about them. Krishnan received racially-tinged death threats, forcing him to close down his social media accounts, and a laundromat that had offered Lampron a job reportedly rescinded the offer as a result of the controversy.:Vickie Lampron declined to be interviewed for this story, so we spoke instead to Shay Totten, spokesman for the Vermont activist organization Rights and Democracy, of which Lampron is a member. Totten told us:Vickie is not a paid protester. She felt very strongly that she wanted to go to D.C. on behalf of herself and her granddaughters because she feared she was seeing women's rights on the line when it came to this Supreme Court nomination. We fundraised to send our members down so they don't have to pay out of pocket. But they don't make any money.Adam Schindler's tweets and video were picked up and widely shared by a large number of social media users and junk news sites, including the Gateway Pundit (which incorrectly referred to Schindler as a ""reporter""), Your News Wire, and conspiracy trolling site Infowars.RealClearPolitics meanwhile ran with the headline ""Three Texas Doctors: We Saw Protesters Paid in Cash to Disrupt Brett Kavanaugh Hearing on Line to Enter."" (We reached out to both Schindler and RealClearPolitics publisher Tom Bevan about their posts but received no response.):The images of a ""paid protester"" have popped up repeatedly since the 4 September hearing in the service of false claims that Kavanaugh's confirmation process was being picketed for profit instead of principle.A detail that many junk sites failed to pick up on was that the same day Schindler published his posts claiming to have witnessed the paying of protesters, he began walking those same claims back:Spoke to the protest organizer. She confirmed handing out cash, but said they intend cash to be used to pay fines they know come when protestors break the law. A small price to pay to be ""heard"" I suppose. #KavanaughConfirmation-- Adam W. Schindler (@AdamSchindler) September 5, 2018On 6 September 2018, Schindler authored a blog post recounting his discussion with organizers from the activist group::I went back to the public ticket line mid-afternoon and approached the gentleman from the photos. I greeted him and the moment he saw me he hurried away. A woman sitting on the bench saw this and stepped in. She identified herself as Jennifer (Flynn Walker), the protest organizer from a group called Center for Popular Democracy. We had a very civil discussion about what they were doing and why.I made an audio recording of this conversation and it is posted in its entirety below. I have also transcribed some key moments in the conversation and posted them below.During our 12 minute discussion, a half dozen protestors gathered around and some participated. The gentleman in the photos did not. The protest leader confirmed her group was providing cash to protestors. She took issue with my use of the term ""payment"", saying the provided cash was only to be used to pay the fines. I was unclear how she was able to enforce this vital distinction for her. But nonetheless, she, and the half dozen members surrounding us, all confirmed her group was giving cash to protestors.She then asked if I was interested in knowing the source of her cash. She had good instincts! I didn't even have to ask. I could sense her pride as she told an emotional story about how it was crowdsourced from donors across the nation. I asked if that was the only source of funding for this protest. I had no reason to doubt the truthfulness of her story. But I did doubt it was the only source of funds. She was quick to ask a clarifying question before answering, as her organization is funded with tens of millions of dollars from George Soros. A fact I'm sure she was familiar with. But she said very precisely, ""That's how we pay for the fines, yes."" And that was that.:Billionaire philanthropist George Soros contributes large sums of money toward progressive causes (the Center for Popular Democracy does receive funding from Soros, for example). He is also the boogeyman in many right-wing conspiracy theories that often veer into anti-Semitism, in which he is typically portrayed as a puppet master orchestrating a vague world take-over.We found no evidence, however, to support the claim that Soros was directly paying out money to Kavanaugh hearing protesters, nor did we find evidence to support accusations that persons demonstrating at the hearings were there because they were being paid to protest."

On the same day, conspiracy site whatdoesitmean.com reported that hacker Marcel Lazar Lehel (whose online moniker is ""Guccifer') had gone missing from his Virginia jail cell.Lehel has made headlines for breaking into the emails of a number of high-level authorities in the United States and his native Romania. He has also claimed that he hacked into Hillary Clinton's and the Democratic National Committee's e-mail servers.:The former taxi driver is currently awaiting sentencing in the United States on charges related to hacking into private AOL accounts:An astounding Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that the Romanian hacker Marcel Lehel Lazar (known as Guccifer), who successfully gained access to all of the private and government emails of Hillary Clinton, was discovered missing yesterday by agents from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) who were sent to interview him at the US jail he was supposed to be in--and his whereabouts are still unknown.The claim didn't get very much traction until 5 July 2016, when FBI Director James Comey announced that the Bureau would not be pursuing charges against Hillary Clinton. That announcement kindled interest in the earlier report that  Guccifer had mysteriously disappeared from his jail cell ahead of an FBI interrogation.Rumors that Lazar had disappeared from (or died in) custody are false and were refuted in a statement from the City of Alexandria Sheriff::Marcel Lehel Lazar, a federal inmate also known as Guccifer, is at the William G. Truesdale Adult Detention Center in Alexandria, Va. He is alive and has never been missing from this facility.The rumor of Guccifer's disappearance originated with a single source: the blogger known by the pen name ""Sorcha Faal"" of the political conspiracy site whatdoesitmean.com. RationalWiki describes that site outlet as ""sensational"" and ""outrageous"":Sorcha Faal is the alleged author of an ongoing series of ""reports"" published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don't think much of it.Each report resembles a news story in its style but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don't contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish.:The fabricated whatdoesitmean.com story about Guccifer's disappearance was picked up a few days later by the Christian Times Newspaper web site, which embellished it into a tale of Lazar's in-custody death.  But the Christian Times Newspaper is just another online fake news outlet (not to be confused with the legitimate Christian Times newspaper) that spins fabricated tales for profit.We contacted authorities at the Virginia jail, who were able to confirm that Lehel is alive, well, and in custody there. There is no truth to the claim he went mysteriously missing from his jail cell in early July 2016. "
53,53,53,40.YesAstronautBuzzAldr,"Claim:Moonwalking astronaut Buzz Aldrin punched a moon-landing-denier conspiracy theorist.Rating:TrueAbout this rating It was the right hook heard round the world.In July 1969, Buzz Aldrin was part of the Apollo 11 crew that first landed on the moon, where he and Neil Armstrong made history as the first humans to set foot on it.:In September 2002, Aldrin, then aged 72, landed a punch on conspiracy theorist Bart Sibrel, who laboring under the false belief that the moon landings were staged, was busy confronting and insulting the legendary astronaut when it happened.The incident occurred outside a hotel in Beverly Hills, California, and was captured on video by Sibrel's crew. Sibrel had been attempting to make a documentary film proving the moon landings were fake, according to news reports at the time.Aldrin can be heard exclaiming, ""Will you get away from me?"" while Sibrel, standing close to him, continues, ""You're a coward and a liar and a thief,"" when Aldrin's punch lands with a thud.The resulting video of the incident probably had the opposite effect that Sibrel was looking for.Police declined to charge Aldrin after witnesses came forward stating that Sibrel had physically provoked him by poking him with a Bible and demanding the 72-year-old swear he really did go to the moon. Additionally, Aldrin had stated he was acting in self-defense and in defense of his stepdaughter, who was accompanying him.:Witnesses also stated that Sibrel had not only lured Aldrin to the hotel under false pretenses, but that he had repeated harassed Aldrin and other Apollo astronauts over the years.Not only was Aldrin not charged, but the video garnered praise for Aldrin, who was seen not only as effectively defending himself but also as delivering poetic justice to a corrosive, nonsensical conspiracy theory.In July 2021, the video was posted on the social media platform Reddit, where it was again widely viewed, and where Reddit users reveled in the moment.""Can you imagine going to the moon and then when you get back having some of the stupidest people on earth telling you it's all fake,"" one Reddit commenter opined.:The Reddit video above even contains the punch in slow-motion."
54,54,54,657.DidDHSSecretlyWaterm,"Claim:The U.S. Department of Homeland Security orchestrated a sting against Democrats by adding a secret watermark to prove their participation in election fraud.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.In the uncertain days following the 2020 U.S. presidential election, a fantasy pushed by QAnon personalities and die-hard supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump went viral. In broad brushstrokes, the idea was that Democrats would soon be exposed in a massive voter-fraud sting operation orchestrated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The basic premise is that Democrats, in an effort to steal the election in favor of their party's nominee, Joe Biden, printed extra ballots. But, the claim goes, Trump's DHS anticipated this and added a secret watermark to the ballots, making it easy to identify the fraudulent ballots.:""The DEMS fell right into the trap of this sting operation and President Trump has it all,"" a viral bit of Facebook copypasta asserted. ""Fraud will be exposed for the world to see.""As with most conspiracy theories, there are myriad variations on this broad claim, each with its own purported evidence. These variations, both tedious and irrelevant, generally concern the type of watermark used, and the presence or absence of some sort of blockchain-based security. Going into each of these different claims is unnecessary, as all versions of the claim hold that the ruse was possible because the federal government controls the production of ballots. This is, emphatically, not the case.In fact, this is left up to the states, each of which has its own regulations to follow. Practically speaking, most elections are administered at the county level, where they are run either by a board of electors, an election official or officials, or both. This means there are, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than more than 10,000 unique election administration jurisdictions in the U.S., each of which with their own balloting procedures. The large conspiracy alleged here would necessarily involve infiltrating thousands of different election boards or jurisdictions.:The federal government is not responsible for printing or auditing the ballots, either. In most cases, private companies contracted by those local election boards to do the printing. DHS has explicitly stated this in response to these rumors:While DHS and CISA assist states and localities with securing election infrastructure, DHS and CISA [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency] do not design, print, or audit ballots. State and local election officials manage ballot design and printing, as well as the auditing of results.Local election offices have security and detection measures in place that make it highly difficult to commit fraud through counterfeit ballots. While the specific measures vary, in accordance with state and local election laws and practices, ballot security measures can include signature matching, information checks, barcodes, watermarks, and precise paper weights.As such, DHS does not control ""official ballot production,"" nor does any central federal authority have that power. Therefore the central premise behind this QAnon fantasy and its claim of secretly watermarked ballots suffers from a profound ignorance of how American presidential elections actually work. For these reasons, the claim is false.:"
55,55,55,220.DidPopeFrancisCancel,"Claim:Pope Francis cancelled the Bible and proposed the creation of a new holy book.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 2 April 2018, ThereIsNews.com published an article which appears to report shocking news for the Catholic church -- Pope Francis had ""cancelled"" the Bible, and is proposing the creation of a new holy book:Pope Francis has surprised the world today by announcing that The Bible is totally outdated and needs a radical change, so The Bible is officially canceled and it's announced a meeting between the highest personalities of the church where it will be decided the book that will replace it, its name and its content. Some names are already being considered and the one that has more strength is ""Biblia 2000"".:ThereIsNews.com is a humor web site that solely publishes fictional content, and it carries a disclaimer on the web site that reads as follows:The site ""There is news"" (https://thereisnews.es) (hereinafter referred to as TIN) is a humor site whose purpose is entertainment.The content of TIN is fiction and does not correspond to reality.All references, names, brands or institutions that appear on the site are used as contextual elements, as in any novel or fiction account.The work of fiction may have fooled some readers, as it was published just a few days after several media outlets reported that Pope Francis had denied one of the core tenets of Catholicism -- the existence of hell. That rumor, too, was likely either embellished or misreported.Pope Francis does have somewhat of a history of making controversial statements that are seemingly at odds with traditional church teachings::In politics, they call it going ""off message."" In acting, they call it going ""off script."" In the Catholic Church under Pope Francis, it has become ""business as usual.""Put the 81-year-old pontiff in front of a microphone, and he will make news.Case in point: During a 2015 brief press conference aboard the papal plane from the Philippines to Rome, when Francis sounded off in his very unpope-like way on birth control, corruption and kicking grifters where the sun don't shine.Although this has caused some genuine concern among religious leaders, it has also spawned rumors that the Pope was deliberately trying to undermine the church. This theory was summed up by the conspiracy theorist blog YourNewsWire.com in an article appearing to report that Pope Francis said that his word ""overruled"" anything written in the Bible:Pope Francis has responded to claims that many of his teachings ""contradict Bible teachings"" by saying that his words ""overrule"" anything written in the Bible.The pope has further angered traditional Christians in recent weeks by developing the habit of hiding the crucifix that is worn around his neck when speaking in public, causing many Christians to believe the pontiff is ashamed to display the powerful Christian symbol.:YourNewsWire.com placed the word ""overrule"" in quotes in both their title and opening sentence, but they never provide the actual quote in which Pope Francis allegedly expressed this belief.  It also posted several photographs of the pontiff, using them to claim that he purposefully hides the crucifix on his neck while in public because he is ashamed of the religious symbol:But Pope Francis is so ashamed of our Lord Jesus Christ that he concealed his pectoral cross from Jews by stuffing it into his fascia or waist sash.These photographs, however, appear to show cherry-picked moments when his cross slips behind his clothing. For example, this web site claimed that Pope Francis hid his cross during a kosher luncheon he hosted in January 2014 for a group of rabbis from Argentina. Although the image they provided appears to be genuine (left), other images from this event show the Pope wearing his cross in full view::Likewise, this web site provided three more images which purportedly showed the pope hiding his cross during a visit to Yad Vashem, Israel's memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, in 2014. And although these images all truly show the Pope with his crucifix partially hidden behind his fascia, this is hardly proof that the Pope is ashamed of his religion.He may have been attempting to be culturally sensitive to his Jewish hosts, or, more likely, these were simply momentary (and wholesome) wardrobe malfunctions, as a number of other photographs from the Pope's trip to Yad Vashem show the crucifix on full display: :A video of the Pope's visit to Yad Vashem also shows his cross both in and out of his waistband:The pope never said that he was cancelling the Bible or that his word ""overruled"" what was written in the holy book. Furthermore, the photographs purportedly showing the pope ""hiding"" his cross from view are merely cherry-picked moments from when the crucifix he wears momentarily slipped behind his clothing.:"
56,56,56,446.DebunkingTrumpTweets,"Claim:Joe Biden won key states in the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to fraudulent late-night ""vote dumps.""Rating:FalseAbout this rating Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.One of the many claims U.S. President Donald Trump and his supporters made in flailing attempts to reverse Trump's defeat by Democratic challenger Joe Biden in the 2020 general election was the assertion that furtive late-night ""dumps"" of illicit ballots had taken place, which wiped out large Trump leads and gave Biden wins in key battleground states::Not only did the ""data dumps"" have nothing fraudulent about them, but they were in fact predictable and had been anticipated well in advance of the election.As we discussed in a separate article, heavy use of mail-in ballots was expected in the election due to the COVID-19 pandemic that made in-person voting risky. Many pre-election discussions noted that the increased use of mail-in ballots could misleadingly skew the early reporting of election results towards one candidate or the other in some states, depending on when those states tabulated their mail-in ballots::Even once the early and in-person ballots are counted, a significant number of votes could still be outstanding. Only nine states expect to have at least 98 percent of unofficial results reported by noon the day after the election.The order in which different types of votes are reported could also make one party look stronger at various points in the night. Democrats are more likely to vote by mail this year, so in states where those will be the first type of ballots released, like Arizona, Florida and North Carolina, initial results could skew in favor of Joseph R. Biden Jr. Places that report in-person Election Day votes first, like most parts of Virginia, will probably look better for President Trump.But the initial skew in a state's results may last only a short while, and it will be influenced by which counties or precincts in the state are the fastest to report ...Moreover, this phenomenon was precisely expected to take place in states that were not allowed (by their own laws) to begin counting mail-in ballots as they were received, but instead had to wait until Election Day or just beforehand -- particularly in the key states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, whose results Trump most vociferously disputed::Voters are casting ballots early in record numbers this year amid the pandemic -- and that's prompting concerns that it might wind up taking longer than expected to get election results, as officials process millions more mail-in ballots than usual.The reality is that most states can begin processing absentee ballots in some form before Election Day, which could help avoid delays in reporting results.But in three critical battleground states -- Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan -- officials aren't allowed to start processing early ballots until on or just before Election Day itself, which could delay not just their state results but also, if the Electoral College count is close, potentially leave the whole presidential race up in the air.The ""vote spikes"" that Trump and his supporters maintain are indicative of election fraud were merely an unsurprising combination of mail-in ballots (which were more heavily used by Democrats) and ballots from areas that vote heavily Democratic. That Trump may have held a lead in early returns reported from these states is irrelevant, akin to claiming that the score at halftime in a football game is more significant than the final result.:In terms of conspiracy theory, this claim runs afoul of some major plot holes, including that:1) It posits that forces working in favor of Democratic candidate Biden were sufficiently powerful, knowledgeable, and widespread to overturn the legitimate election results, yet they couldn't manage to do so in a manner that wasn't clumsy and blatantly obvious.2) It posits that these nefarious operators somehow were able to pull off in 2020 the very thing they had been completely unable to achieve in 2016, when Trump secured the election over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton by winning the very same three states (Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan) by relatively narrow margins."
57,57,57,618.TheFallacyofMovingth,"Here at Snopes, we encounter our fair share of logical fallacies, or errors in reasoning that tend to be more persuasive than they really are, and are based on poor or faulty logic. In previous coverage, we've looked at a range of fallacies including ad hominem attacks, the black sheep effect, confirmation biases, and more. Now, we're unpacking the concept of ""changing the goalposts"" -- or reworking ""the terms of a debate or conflict after its started,"" according to journalist and editor Peter Stothard, speaking to The New York Times in 1990, to gain an advantage over others.Indeed, changing the rules in the middle of a process has been commonly employed as a form of workplace abuse, as well as a misinformation tactic. Dave Hahn, adjunct professor of philosophy at SUNY Geneseo, described it thus in an article for The Skeptic:The conspiracy theorist posits an epistemic standard that they claim will disabuse them of their position. They say, 'I will no longer believe my theory if you can provide X evidence.""You, the intelligent (and good looking) skeptic reply, ""You mean this evidence? Here you are.""At this point, in an ideal world, this conversation should be over. The conspiracy theorist should shrug and reply, ""Oh, that evidence does exist. I guess I was mistaken, perhaps we should share a tea and have a friendly chuckle about this.""Instead the conspiracy theorist shifts the goalposts. Instead of reconsidering their belief, they ask for X+1. If you provide X+1, it will not matter because they will then ask for X+2, then X+3...and so on. The temptation for us skeptics is to provide the evidence, and if we do, we are falling for their trap, which will be perceived as a 'victory' for their side. :In workplaces, this can take the form of ""raising the bar"" for success, and often facilitates discrimination against women and other marginalized groups. The New York Times detailed a discrimination lawsuit from 1999 that fit this description:When Cornelius Cooper, a lineman at the Georgia Power Company, joined a discrimination lawsuit against his employer last summer, he did not dwell on the company's failure to promote him to a training job.Instead, Mr. Cooper, who is black, complained that Georgia Power kept raising the bar. In 1992, for example, when he was working on underground power lines, he was denied a promotion because he lacked sufficient experience working with overhead lines, he said in court papers. Even though he disagreed, he spent nearly a year working on overhead lines to get the job, he said, only to be told that he did not have enough experience with underground lines.In numerous cases of discrimination against Black employees, lawyers pointed out that employers were moving the goalposts: ""They [workers] are told they cannot advance to a coveted job until they acquire a particular skill, like obtaining a college degree or learning how to use new software. Then, when they achieve that goal, the employer sets another requirement and the promotion sails even farther out of reach."" :How does this play out in politics? Political comedy show ""The Daily Show"" made this argument about former U.S. President Donald Trump in his response to the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, saying he moved the goalposts on his predictions for how many people would die from the virus as death tolls rose. In a series of clips taken from different speeches, Trump's initial forecasts for the number of COVID-19 deaths shifted considerably from 60,000 to 200,000 as he was proven wrong by the increasing number of fatalities. In order to spin the government's handling of the pandemic as a success story, his standards evolved.:U.S. President Joe Biden similarly had shifting goalposts when it came to reopening schools from COVID lockdowns; that is, moving students from online-only to in-person learning. In February 2021, his press secretary stated that, by day 100 of his presidency (April 30, 2021), the administration would like most schools to have at least one in-person day each week.""[That's] the bar of where we'd like the majority of schools across the country to be, which they're not at this point in time, and we want to build from there.""A week later, after some people criticized the administration for not taking bigger strides to get students back to in-person classes, Biden denied that his administration thought that one day a week was enough and told a town-hall audience his goal was five days of classroom instruction, and, ""I think we'll be close to that at the end of the first 100 days."" The next day, his press secretary added that the one-day-a-week policy ""was our floor, it was not our ceiling."" Check out more explanations of logical fallacies here and here. "

""It is a man-made virus created in the lab based on the China ... the very unique bat coronavirus, which cannot affect people, but after the modification becomes a very harmful virus.""Yan did claim that SARS-CoV-2 was made in a lab, but the suggestion is false, misleading, and based on a non-peer-reviewed report that was published in two separate studies on Sept. 14 and Oct. 8 in the preprint server Zenodo, which means that the research had not gone through rigorous editorial critically evaluated by scientific experts with an extra degree of scrutiny. Research that has not been peer-reviewed is akin to a blog -- anyone can publish one online with little expertise. A reviewed study, on the other hand, is on par with a well-vetted, expertly researched textbook. To facilitate the quick spread of new scientific information in the midst of the pandemic, prepublication research has become more common in order to facilitate the quick dissemination of important information, particularly as peer-reviewed research can take a long time to publish.:Despite its erroneous claims, the study had been downloaded more than half of a million times and received more than 700,000 views as of this writing.A History of Contentious Origin ClaimsSince SARS-CoV-2 was first discovered in January 2020 and subsequently declared a pandemic the following month, conspiracy theorists have peddled notions that the virus was made in a lab and intentionally released as a biological weapon despite rigorous scientific research proving otherwise. According to one expert: ""This particular conspiracy around deliberate release form a laboratory has been doing the rounds throughout the pandemic. It has been rebutted several times already. Ultimately, it could be damaging to public health if reported uncritically without looking at the wider evidence. If people are exposed to and then believe conspiracy theories, this will likely have a negative impact on efforts to keep COVID-19 cases low and thus there will be more death and illness than there needs to be,"" said Dr. Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, in a statement.:And Yan's account of the origins of the virus is no different. The controversial doctor first made headlines in July 2020 when she told Fox News in an exclusive interview that she believed the Chinese government failed to tell the world about the virus' origins at its onset, ignoring her research and potentially putting lives at risk. At the time, Hong Kong University (HKU) issued a news release confirming that Yan had previously been affiliated as a post-doctoral fellow but that she had since left the institution. The news release continued:While HKU respects freedom of expression, Dr Yan's past or present opinions and views do not represent those of the University.HKU notes that the content of the said news report does not accord with the key facts as we understand them. Specifically, Dr Yan never conducted any research on human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus at HKU during December 2019 and January 2020, her central assertion of the said interview.We further observe that what she might have emphasized in the reported interview has no scientific basis but resembles hearsay.HKU does not act on hearsay and we will not further comment on this matter.:Snopes contacted HKU for further comment but did not receive a response at the time of publication. Emails sent from our team to the address listed on Yan's report also went unanswered.In a September 2020 interview with the hosts of the British talk show ""Loose Women,"" Yan claimed that she had been chosen to do a ""secret investigation"" while studying a cluster of SARS-related viruses in December 2019 when she found out that the Chinese government was manufacturing a virus to use as a bioweapon. After confronting her supervisor, she claimed, she was allegedly forced to flee to the U.S. for her own safety. The story was reiterated in an interview with Tucker Carlson the following day when she directly blamed the Chinese Communist Party for manufacturing the virus.In less than a week after airing, the interview had been viewed more than 2.2 million times. :Several media publications reported that Yan's Twitter account was suspended as of Sept. 21, 2020. The first known mention of the suspension was on Tucker Carlson Tonight, however, Twitter declined to comment on the alleged suspension in an email sent to Snopes, and the platform did not flag the virologist's interview. A video of the interview is also still available on Facebook and Instagram, however, both platforms flagged the video for its misleading content.Funding Ties to the Rule of Law Society:The report was primarily authored by Yan and three other researchers who listed an affiliation with the Rule of Law Society on the cover page. The society is a political organization -- not a research institution -- that was founded by exiled Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui, who fled China in 2014 in advance of corruption charges, and Steve Bannon, an American businessman and political strategist who previously oversaw the far-right publication Breitbart News, and was recently arrested in connection to the ""We Build The Wall"" fraud scam.Dr. Andrew Preston, a biologist at the University of Bath, highlighted in a statement that the authors' affiliation with a politically based organization rather than with a research institution was a conflict of interest and added that the ""preprint report cannot be given any credibility in its current form,"" given its unsubstantiated claims that have not been peer-reviewed.""The report is not based on an objective interpretation of the SARS-CoV2 genome. The interpretations made are not supported by data, are unsubstantiated and the interpretations are largely stated but not explained,"" Preston said. The scientists continued that the report does not appear to start with an open hypothesis about the origin of SARS-CoV2. The language of the report is reminiscent of a conspiracy theory."":Yan's primary argument is that the genetic structure of SARS-CoV-2 provided evidence that the virus was manufactured by researchers with the Chinese Communist Party by targeting select parts of the viral genome, a feat that would be nearly impossible, said Craig Wilen, assistant professor of laboratory medicine and immunology at the Yale School of Medicine, in an interview with Snopes. But first, it's important to understand how a virus is sequenced and what researchers know about SARS-CoV-2.How to Sequence a VirusWhen a new virus is discovered, scientists around the world will work as quickly as possible to create a genetic map by sequencing every genome held within the virus. At the onset of the 2020 pandemic, researchers quickly transcribed the genetic makeup of the virus and uploaded what was known about the 30,000 base-pair genomes into a global database for future study. When mapped, the virus was found to contain roughly 30,000 nucleotides, which form the basis of each structural unit of DNA.:Once a map of the base pair is determined, synthesizing a virus in a lab is not unheard of. In fact, many commercial companies hold repositories of ""chunks"" of genomic material, but in order to manufacture a virus such as SARS-CoV-2, a scientist would need to take the 30,000 base-pair genome, make that into ribonucleic acid (RNA), and then turn that RNA into a virus. Wilen said that expert virology labs could, in theory, manipulate SARS-CoV, the virus responsible for the 2002 SARS pandemic, or MERS-CoV, the virus that caused the 2014 MERS pandemic, to hypothetically manufacture a new virus, but would first need to know what each of those individual nucleotides is responsible for, and how to manipulate them to become harmful and infectious to humans -- an enormous feat that is beyond the scope of many viral labs and research.""Being off by one could destroy the entire virus. As much as the world has studied this virus now, we have no idea what properties those 30,000 base pairs, which of those are important for infection, which of those make it spread asymptomatically, which of those cause disease,"" Wilen said. ""So, we are totally ignorant in terms of the biology in terms of being able to come up with the sequence de novo to then make it."":Wilen likened the manufacturing of a virus to taking one of Shakespeare's sonnets, determining how many words it contains, then chopping up a dictionary and subsequently trying to build a sonnet from those chopped-up words.""Yes, you would get something that is the right length of a sonnet, but almost certainly it's going to be incoherent and not useful,"" he said.Evolutionary Processes Exhibited in the Coronavirus FamilyIn her report, Yan argued that two strains of bat coronavirus were shown to be 89% similar to SARS-CoV-2, which seems at first glance to be quite a bit. Coronaviruses are a large family of closely related viruses that naturally circulate in a number of different species, including bats, camels, pangolins, and rodents. A huge amount of genetic diversity of coronaviruses occurs naturally in the environment, and when it comes to human pandemic coronaviruses, all three have exhibited cross-species transmission from a nonhuman host.:In actuality, 89% of genetic similarity is very low. Previous research found that the human genome is almost 99% identical to chimpanzees and bonobos, yet there are very obvious differences between the two species. In terms of Yan's genetic mapping, 89% would suggest that there are roughly 3,300 nucleotides not shared between the two viruses and, if SARS-CoV-2 was manufactured in a lab, researchers would have had to pinpoint the cause and effect of each of those nucleotides in order to make it both infectious and harmful to humans.Yan further argued that SARS-CoV-2 is like ""Frankenstein,"" if the beast were a cow with a ""deer's head, rabbit ears, and also has monkey's hands,"" which in her logic, suggested that the virus cannot be natural. Wilen said that although this comparison was hyperbolic, it's not necessarily incorrect -- viruses undergo several evolutionary changes throughout their short life cycle, but that doesn't mean that they were manufactured in a lab. Coronaviruses' ability to evolve from animal to human transmission is due, in part, to its unique life cycle. Viruses tend to have a 12-hour life cycle while humans, on the other hand, have an average life expectancy of 79 years. Because of this quick lifespan, viruses undergo rapid evolutionary changes in an incredibly short amount of time.:Coronaviruses can mutate in two ways, the first of which occurs during replication. Viruses are capable of replicating once they have infected a host, and it is through that replication process that an error can sometimes occur, and one of the tens-of-thousands of nucleotides may mutate. This mutation can change the function of a particular protein, and though such errors are often harmless or have no physical consequence to the virus, sometimes a mutation can result in the virus being unable to replicate or lose its infectiousness. The other way coronaviruses can mutate is through a process known as genetic recombination. This occurs when viruses of two different, but closely related, strains simultaneously infect the same host cell and interact while they are replicating to create a viral progeny (new virus) from two ""parent viruses"" that contains genes from both. Recombination is seen in other viruses and happens often. A study published in the April 2020 issue of the scientific journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution found that the SARS-CoV-2 genome can be more than 95% similar to another coronavirus (RaTG3) that was isolated from bats, while a study published in Nature in March found that pangolin coronavirus genomes were between 85.5% and 92.4% similar. Ironically, the similarities between multiple coronavirus samples taken from the wild and SARS-CoV-2 actually argue in favor of natural evolution by way of recombination.:""In the wild, these viruses are circulated all over the place. Animals are getting infected with multiple coronaviruses that are genetically similar, and that facilitates this recombination happening in the wild. It's easy to make it happen in the lab, but it absolutely happens in the wild. This is a good way to make big, functional changes in viruses,"" Wilen said."
59,59,59,290.LeakedEmailShowsClin,"Claim:A leaked Clinton Foundation e-mail demonstrates collusion between the organization and media personality John Oliver.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 7 October 2016, various conspiracy theory web sites posted articles alleging that a hacked e-mail from the personal account of a former Hillary Clinton employee at the U.S. State Department, Capricia Penavic Marshall, suggested ""some level of collusion"" between the Clintons, HBO, and British-born comedian and television host John Oliver::As presenter of the popular HBO show Last Week Tonight, Oliver has made a name for himself with a series of anti-Donald Trump monologues, including one that made global headlines when he revealed that the Trump family name was once changed from the ancestral name ""Drumpf"".The email was sent on February 19, 2015 by Greg Propper, an advisor to The Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. Its recipients included Sarah Henning, Director of Programs at the Clinton Foundation, and Capricia Marshal, who served as served as chief of protocol from 2009 to 2013 under Secretary Clinton at the State Department.The email, which was sent to Henning's 'clintonfoundation.org' address, is entitled, ""We've made contact with John Olivier"" and the body of the email reads, ""And his team is working on it. Hope to have an answer tomorrow.""While acknowledging that the spelling of Oliver's name is off by one character -- ""We've made contact with John Olivier,"" the e-mail reads -- InfoWars goes on to claim that ""the context makes it clear that the email is in reference to the comedian."" That's patently false, however, considering that the entire message consists of 20 words:::We are unable to explain why InfoWars wanted to convince us that the e-mail provides enough context to conclude that ""John Olivier"" is ""John Oliver"" -- unless it's because they don't want us poking around and finding out there are more e-mails in the exchange that not only establish the context, but also prove that the Clinton associates reached out to Oliver for a perfectly above-board reason: to invite him to make a guest appearance at a March 9, 2015 event being planned in conjunction with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.In fact, Oliver was but one of a long list of celebrities under consideration::Apropos of John Oliver, the idea was apparently to have him open the show with a short comedy sketch. From the looks of it, they were trying to get singer John Legend to entertain, as well::Neither Oliver nor Legend ended up performing in the show. We scanned the leaked e-mails for further evidence of conspiracy, but found none -- unless you count the idea of staging a surprise truce between ""feuding"" pop stars Katy Perry and Taylor Swift, an event that (like Oliver's appearance) also never came to pass."
60,60,60,120.WasSeanHannityOuteda,"On 16 April 2018, a court hearing relating to a federal criminal investigation of President Donald Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen took an unexpected twist when it emerged that Fox News host and frequent conspiracy theory cheerleader Sean Hannity was one of his clients.Predictably, perhaps, news of Hannity's relationship with Trump's embattled lawyer prompted conspiracy trolls to spread baseless stories that Hannity had been outed by the ""deep state."" However, Hannity's name had been revealed as the result of a judge's order after federal prosecutors argued that the identity of an anonymous Cohen client (Hannity) should be made known for the sake of transparency.The news came after Hannity had for days railed against a Federal Bureau of Investigation raid on Cohen's office, home and hotel room in execution of search warrants the previous week. Hannity did not disclose to his audience that Cohen was also his attorney. In a statement, Hannity said:Michael Cohen has never represented me in any matter. I never retained him, received an invoice, or paid legal fees. I have occasionally had brief discussions with him about legal questions about which I wanted his input and perspective.[...]In response to some wild speculation, let me make clear that I did not ask Michael Cohen to bring this proceeding on my behalf, I have no personal interest in this proceeding, and, in fact, asked that my de minimis discussions with Michael Cohen, which dealt almost exclusively about real estate, not be made a part of this proceeding.:Hannity frequently traffics the ""deep state"" conspiracy theory on his show and on social media, and Internet hucksters quickly picked up the trail, producing a stream of baseless stories that spread, as usual, via disreputable web sites and social media trolls.For example, TheGatewayPundit.com, an unreliable site currently being sued for defamation after accusing an innocent person of being the suspect accused of killing a counter-protester at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville in August 2017, published a story with the extraordinarily misleading headline, ""BREAKING: Sean Hannity Responds After Deep State Alleges He Was Michael Cohen's 3rd Client.""Alt-right Twitter troll Jack Posobiec drew on another tired conspiracy theory to insinuate that billionaire philanthropist George Soros pulled the strings, causing the judge to identify Hannity as one of Cohen's clients:The judge who ordered Sean Hannity's name outed performed George Soros' wedding pic.twitter.com/33evQeRCZ0-- Jack Posobiec (@JackPosobiec) April 16, 2018:Unsurprisingly, Alex Jones's conspiracy network InfoWars quickly followed suit with paranoid reporting that conflated two unrelated events: In 2013, Judge Kimba Wood officiated Soros's wedding. Five years later, she presided over the Cohen hearing in which Hannity was named as his client. This was presented as shadowy malfeasance by Jones and his ilk who apparently believe Soros is an all-powerful puppeteer who, despite every indication to the contrary, controls the world:The U.S. District judge who ordered Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen to identify Sean Hannity had officiated billionaire George Soros' wedding in 2013.Judge Kimba Wood officiated the ""non-denominational"" wedding between Soros and his third wife Tamiko Bolton in 2013 in Bedford, New York.Suddenly, Wood's decision to force Cohen to disclose his clients becomes clear.Jared Holt, a writer for Right Wing Watch -- a web site operated by the liberal advocacy nonprofit group People for the American Way, which tracks and monitors right-wing extremist rhetoric -- told us the ""deep state"" theme was ready-made for the news about Hannity::Every single night on Sean Hannity's program there's some kind of talk about the deep state in one form or another. It's used as a sort of bludgeon to discredit any federal investigation into the goings on of Trump's campaign and his associates. It was almost a natural fit that the deep state conspiracy theories that he s putting forward eventually got applied to his own case. I guess it's not incredibly surprising, but it truly came full circle.The ""deep state"" conspiracy theory posits that the hand of a ""shadow government"" controls all, and that it is mounting a campaign to oust President Trump and undo his supporters; it is often promoted by Trump himself. (There is no clear reason given that an authoritarian, murderous ""shadow government"" would allow a select few to continue talking about its existence on public airwaves that potentially reach millions of viewers or listeners, but no one ever seems to ask.)According to whistleblower Christopher Wylie, the phrase ""deep state"" was tested by scandal-plagued psychographics firm Cambridge Analytica on Facebook users to gauge their reaction without their knowledge or consent.:Many of the personalities latching on to this most recent claim also went to the mat for other outlandish ideas, including the inexplicably prominent PizzaGate yarn that held Trump's 2016 rival Hillary Clinton was involved in a pedophile ring run out of the basement a Washington, D.C. pizzeria (the restaurant has no basement).For his part, Hannity was one of the most vocal proponents of the baseless claim that Seth Rich, a murdered Democratic National Committee staffer, had stolen Clinton's emails in the days leading up to the election instead of Russian hackers. Rich's family is now suing Fox News over the botched reporting of that story and its aftermath."
61,61,61,68.SaturdayNightSkive,"Claim:   Saturday Night Live (SNL) aired a ""Conspiracy Theory Rock!"" segment once in 1998, after which it was banned by the network.   MOSTLY FALSE:WHAT'S TRUE:   A 1998 episode of SNL included a ""Schoolhouse Rock!"" parody segment called ""Conspiracy Theory Rock!"" that was dropped from subsequent reruns of the episode.     WHAT'S FALSE:   The ""Conspiracy Theory Rock!"" segment was banned or suppressed by the network because its anti-corporate message was deemed too dangerous, offensive to sponsors, or otherwise unflattering to various corporations.Example:     [Collected via Facebook, September 2015]This was actually shown on Saturday Night Live in 1998 -- just one time. It was then pulled from future syndication of SNL. Wonder why? Hmmm ...Posted by Brandon Weber on Friday, September 11, 2015Origins:    On 11 September 2015, Upworthy contributor Brandon Weber posted the video shown above, a segment from a 1998 episode of Saturday Night Live, a conspiracy theory-like segment (done in a video style imitative of the popular ""Schoolhouse Rock!"" series of animated educational shorts= films) that posited a phenomenon of large corporations gaining increasing control of the news (and other informational) media and using their hegemony to control what the public sees and hears -- usually to the benefit of the corporation and the detriment of consumers.  Weber's post stated that the segment had aired only once (during the SNL episode's original network broadcast) and then had been excised from syndicated repeats of the episode, suggesting that the corporate powers-that-be had wielded their influence to clamp down on furthers airing of such an unflattering (and possibly true) portrayal.:This September 2015 Facebook post clearly made quite an impression on fellow social media users, but it also  oversimplified the story behind the ""Conspiracy Theory Rock!"" segment and later airings of it.  The rumor that the segment had since been ""suppressed"" was expressed at least as far back as 18 June 1998, when a New York Daily News article titled ""'SNL' Kills Controversial Cartoon Spoof"" reported that:Alert viewers will notice something missing from this weekend's ""Saturday Night Live,"" a repeat of a March broadcast hosted by actress Julianne Moore: the ""TV Funhouse"" animated segment that aired in the original show. The slyly lighthearted piece titled ""Conspiracy Theory Rock"" and produced in the style of PBS' ""Schoolhouse Rock"" kids' show actually was a sophisticated satire of the increasing concentration of media ownership in a small number of huge multi-national corporations. It included references to Disney/ABC, CBS and NBC and its parent company, General Electric. ""SNL"" executive producer Lorne Michaels said he decided to pull the segment because ""I didn't think it worked comedically.""Michaels said he was not concerned at all about the references to NBC and General Electric, and that a passing dig at NBC West Coast executive Don Ohlmeyer for firing former ""SNL"" cast member Norm Macdonald is now dated. ""The test was putting it on live,"" Michaels said. ""If we hadn't aired it originally, we would have been accused of bowing to corporate pressure and censorship and all that. I wanted to support [writer/producer] Robert [Smigel] in what he wanted to do creatively, so I put it on the air."":The article additionally stated that Michaels had said ""editing elements out of shows before they're rerun isn't common but is certainly not unprecedented,"" and a 23 April 2006 New York Times profile of Robert Smigel (a longtime SNL contributor and creator of ""Saturday TV Funhouse,"" the recurring segment of which ""Conspiracy Theory Rock!"" was a part) contained a portion that reported Michaels had opted to cut the segment from the episode to make room for other material:Then there is the matter of a short called ""Conspiracy Theory Rock,"" a parody of the ABC educational cartoon ""Schoolhouse Rock,"" which begins as a bright, sing-along indictment of media consolidation, and ends by criticizing NBC's news division for ignoring the misdeeds of General Electric, the network's parent company. Since making its debut on the March 14, 1998, episode of ""SNL,"" ""Conspiracy Theory Rock"" has not been rebroadcast.""It just struck me as really funny to do it on our own network,"" he said. ""I was somewhat delighted that they were O.K. to do that, and then they reconsidered. It's hard to get angry about it.""Mr. Michaels said that ""Conspiracy Theory Rock"" had simply been cut from reruns to make room for a second performance from the episode's musical guests, the Backstreet Boys. When ""Saturday TV Funhouse"" is not stirring up controversy, it allows Mr. Smigel to express ideas that perhaps no other venue could accommodate. :While the 2006 New York Times article didn't state that ""Conspiracy Theory Rock!"" had been ""banned,"" it did indicate that at that time the segment had never been rebroadcast. In January 2012 , a Huffington Post article reported that Michaels had said the ""Conspiracy Theory Rock!"" clip ""wasn't funny"" and therefore was rarely included in subsequent airings of the show (although the article provided no citation for that statement) but noted that the clip had been available in a ""Saturday TV Funhouse"" DVD compilation since 2006:It aired once with the original ""SNL"" episode, and was pulled from syndication because it ""wasn't funny,"" according to ""SNL"" creator and producer Lorne Michaels, but it got a lot of attention when comedian Marc Maron tweeted a link to the video.The cartoon has since gone viral as a ""banned"" clip, but according to J.J. Sedelmaier, who created ""Funhouse"" along with Robert Smigel for ""The Dana Carvey Show,"" the clip was ""unavailable for viewing (separate from our studio's reel) for quite some time,"" but did, however, eventually end up being ""included in the ""Saturday TV Funhouse"" DVD compilation that was released in 2006,"" which is probably where the video being passed around online was ripped from.:So although it's true that ""Conspiracy Theory Rock"" was largely elided from subsequent SNL broadcasts of the episode in which it originally appeared, no available evidence supports the notion that the clip was formally banned by any particular interests rather than, as producer Lorne Michaels stated, it was trimmed due to run-time restrictions and his judgment that the material was dated and didn't come across as funny.It's also the case that if NBC and/or the network's corporate parent, General Electric, had considered the ""Conspiracy Theory Rock!"" segment too offensive or potentially troublesome for their tastes, they likely wouldn't have broadcast it in the first place.  While Saturday Night Live's format means the network has somewhat diminished control over what goes out on the air should there be a disparity between the show's scripted material and what gets performed live in the moment, the ""Saturday TV Funhouse"" segments were animated and were therefore necessarily prepared in advance and available for review prior to airtime.In any case, since the 29 April 2006 release of the Saturday Night Live -- The Best of Saturday TV Funhouse DVD included ""Conspiracy Theory Rock!"" among 24 installments of that recurring SNL segment in a package officially released by NBC Universal Television, it's fairly safe to say ""Conspiracy Theory Rock!"" is not now in a state of being ""banned"" or ""suppressed"" by network ownership.:"

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.It's widely believed that social media conspiracy theories are driven by malicious and anonymous ""bots"" set up by shadowy third parties. But my new research - which examined an extremely successful COVID-19 conspiracy theory - has shown that ordinary citizen accounts can be just as culpable when it comes to spreading dangerous lies and misinformation.The pandemic has fuelled at least ten conspiracy theories this year.  Some linked the spread of the disease to the 5G network, leading to phone masts being vandalised. Others argued that COVID-19 was a biological weapon. Research has shown that conspiracy theories could contribute to people ignoring social distancing rules. The #FilmYourHospital movement was one such theory. It encouraged people to record videos of themselves in seemingly empty, or less-than-crowded, hospitals to prove the pandemic is a hoax. Many videos showing empty corridors and wards were shared.:Our research sought to identify the drivers of the conspiracy and examine whether the accounts that propelled it in April 2020 were bots or real people. Scale of the conspiracyThe 5G conspiracy attracted 6,556 Twitter users over the course of a single week. The #FilmYourHospital conspiracy was much larger than 5G, with a total of 22,785 tweets sent over a seven day period by 11,333 users. It also had strong international backing. Graph shows how the conspiracy theory discussion was broken up into different groups.Wasim Ahmed, Author providedThe visualisation above shows each Twitter user as a small circle and the overall discussion is clustered into a number of different groups. These groups are formed based on how users were mentioning and re-tweeting each other.The visualisation highlights how the three largest groups were responsible for spreading the conspiracy the furthest. For instance, the discussion in groups one and two was centred around a single tweet that was highly re-tweeted. The tweet suggested the public were being misled and that hospitals were not busy or overrun - as had been reported by the mainstream media. The tweet then requested other users to film their hospitals using the hashtag so that it could become a trending topic. The graphic shows the reach and size of these groups.:Where are the bots?We used Botometer to detect bots that draw on a machine learning algorithm. The tool calculates a score where low scores indicate human behaviour and a high score indicates a bot. Botometer works by extracting various features from an account such as its profile, friends, social network, patterns in temporal activity, language and sentiment. Our study took a 10% systematic representative sample of users to run through Botometer. Our results indicated that the rate of automated accounts was likely to be low. We used the raw scores from Botometer to attach a probability label of whether the account was likely to be a bot. These ranged from very low, low, low-medium and high probability.At best, only 9.2% of the sample that we looked at resembled highly suspicious account behaviour or bots. That means over 90% of accounts we examined were probably genuine.  :Figure shows how many of the accounts were suspicious or bot-like.Wasim Ahmed, Author providedInterestingly, we also found that deleted accounts and automated accounts contained keywords such as ""Trump"" and ""Make America Great Again"" in their user-bios. Around the same time President Donald Trump had been in disagreement with scientific advisers on when to lift lockdown rules. Where did it come from?When we examined the most influential users connected to the hashtag we found that the conspiracy theory was driven by influential conservative politicians as well as far-right political activists. Scholars have noted how the far right has been exploiting the pandemic. For example, some of have set up channels on Telegram, a cloud-based instant messaging service, to discuss COVID-19 and have amplified disinformation. But once the conspiracy theory began to generate attention it was sustained by ordinary citizens. The campaign also appeared to be supported and driven by pro-Trump Twitter accounts and our research found that some accounts that behaved like ""bots"" and deleted accounts tended to be pro-Trump. It is important to note that not all accounts that behave like bots are bots, as there might be users who are highly active who could receive a high score. And, conversely, not all bots are harmful as some have been set up for legitimate purposes. :Twitter users frequently shared YouTube videos in support of the theory and YouTube was an influential source.Can they be stopped?Social media organisations can monitor for suspicious accounts and content and if they violate the terms of service, the content should be removed quickly. Twitter experimented with attaching warning labels on tweets. This was initially unsuccessful because Twitter accidentally mislabelled some tweets, which might have inadvertently pushed conspiracies further. But if they manage to put together a better labelling technique this could be an effective method. Conspiracies can also be countered by providing trustworthy information, delivered from public health authorities as well as popular culture ""influencers"". For instance, Oldham City Council in the UK, enlisted the help of actor James Buckley - famous for his role as Jay in the E4 sitcom The Inbetweeners - to spread public health messages.:And other research highlights that explaining flawed arguments and describing scientific consensus may help reduce the effect of misinformation.. Sadly, no matter what procedures and steps are put in place, there will always be people who will believe in conspiracies. The onus must be on the platforms to make sure these theories are not so easily spread.:Wasim Ahmed, Lecturer in Digital Business, Newcastle UniversityThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

The post included photographs of packed asbestos material adorned with the face of Trump and the text ""Approved by Donald Trump, 45th President of the United States."":Asbestos is a mineral that was once widely used in construction projects for its fire resistant properties, but research has since linked it to a variety of cancers, most notably lung cancer and mesothelioma. :The non-profit health and environmental protection Environmental Working Group, who first called attention to the Uralasbest post, provided an English translation of the text that was shared alongside the image: ""Donald is on our side! ... He supported the head of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, who stated that his agency would no longer deal with negative effects potentially derived from products containing asbestos. Donald Trump supported a specialist and called asbestos '100% safe after application.'""These images, as they were posted to the official social media accounts of Uralasbest, are genuine. Also genuine is President Trump's support of the asbestos industry. Trump once opined, in his 1997 book The Art of the Comeback, that efforts to reduce and regulate asbestos (a material he claimed was ""100% safe"" once applied) in building construction were part of a mob-led conspiracy: ""I believe that the movement against asbestos was led by the mob, because it was often mob-related companies that would do the asbestos removal. Great pressure was put on politicians, and as usual, the politicians relented.""In June, when Uralasbest posted their message of support, then-Administrator of the EPA Scott Pruitt had recently announced new interpretations of the Toxic Substances Control Act that could allow for ""new uses"" of asbestos to be approved in the United States. While this move would not allow for previously banned uses to be considered, it was a reversal of Obama-era rules that barred the EPA from considering any new uses for asbestos.:"
64,64,64,156.COVID19WhytheLabLeak,"This article about COVID-19 origins is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.A year and a half into the pandemic, we still do not know exactly where the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, came from. The prevailing view so far has been that the virus ""spilled over"" from bats into humans. But there are increasing calls to investigate the possibility that it emerged from a lab in Wuhan, China, where Covid first appeared at the end of 2019.So what do we know for sure, and what do we need still to find out?We know the sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is close to that of bat coronaviruses. Several decades ago its ""ancestor"" was circulating in bat populations in southern Asia.:But there are still many unanswered questions: we don't know how the virus arrived in Wuhan, how its sequence evolved to allow human infection, and under what conditions it infected the first people who crossed its path. And for each of these stages, we don't know whether there was a human contribution (direct or indirect).Zoonotic transmission pathways, in other words the passage of viruses from animals to humans, are now widely documented around the world. Scientists even consider that this is a principal mechanism for the spreading of new viruses.But the fact that the pandemic began in the vicinity of a main virus research centre that specialises in the study of coronaviruses with epidemic potential in humans - the Wuhan Institute of Virology - has given rise to another hypothesis, the lab leak theory. Lab accidents have already led to human infections, including the H1N1 flu pandemic of 1977, which killed more than 700,000 people.Which theory is correct? In the absence of definitive proof, and without promoting conspiracy theories, there needs to be a serious international conversation about the origin of SARS-CoV-2.:The zoonosis theoryIn the scientific community, the debate on the origin of SARS-CoV-2 started with the publication of two articles at the very beginning of the outbreak.The first, dated February 19, 2020, was published in the medical science journal The Lancet. This article, signed by 27 scientists, highlighted the efforts of Chinese experts to identify the source of the pandemic and share the results. The authors deplored ""rumours and misinformation"" about the origins of the virus, and stated that they ""strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that Covid-19 does not have a natural origin"". The authors based their opinion on the first published sequence data, but did not detail the scientific arguments supporting a natural origin. :In March 2020, another article published in Nature Medicine provided a series of scientific arguments in favour of a natural origin. The authors argued:The natural hypothesis is plausible, as it is the usual mechanism of emergence of coronavirusesThe sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is too distantly related from other known coronaviruses to envisage the manufacture of a new virus from available sequencesIts sequence does not show evidence of genetic manipulation in the laboratory.This last argument can be questioned, as methods do exist which allow scientists to modify viral sequences without leaving a trace. These include cutting the genome into fragments that can later be joined together or, more recently, using the ISA protocol, whereby overlapping fragments naturally come together in cells through homologous recombination: a phenomenon in which two DNA molecules exchange fragments. Besides, genetic manipulation is not the only scenario compatible with a laboratory accident or leak.:Meanwhile, intense research that has been carried out for more than a year to try to prove the zoonotic scenario has not been successful so far: all 80,000 animal samples, from some 30 species, have tested negative. The samples came from farm animals and wild animals from different provinces in China. But it is important to note that this large number of negative samples does not refute the zoonotic scenario.The lab theoryThe first articles arguing for the laboratory accident theory received little attention, perhaps because they came from groups like the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which tends to be critical of technology, or outsiders such as the DRASTIC team (an acronym for ""decentralized radical autonomous search team investigating Covid-19"").Composed of 24 self-styled ""Twitter detectives"" who are mostly anonymous with the exception of a few scientists participating under their real names, the DRASTIC group formed on Twitter in 2020 and has set itself the mission of exploring the origins of SARS-CoV-2. Information and arguments from the group have been examined in their own right, taken up and developed by some virologists, microbiologists and science communicators.:In July 2020, one of the authors of this article, Etienne Decroly, co-wrote a scientific paper discussing the possibility of a laboratory accident. The lab leak theory gained wider traction after a May 13 article in the journal Science, signed by 18 scientists, called again for the origins of SARS-CoV-2 to be examined.:The Wuhan Institute of Virology has been mooted as the potential source of SARS-CoV-2.Ureem2805, CC BY-SASo is it possible? Several elements regarding the emergence of the virus do raise questions. In particular, it has been established that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was handling viruses close to SARS-CoV-2 collected in southern China.In addition to direct genetic manipulation, a laboratory accident could also have occurred as a result of infection during collection in the wild or during an experiment with a virus that evolved in cells or mice in the laboratory, without necessarily directly manipulating its genome.How can we find out for sure?In an investigation at the start of this year, a joint commission between China and the World Health Organization (WHO) failed to identify the cause of the pandemic, concluding that a zoonotic origin is most likely and the hypothesis of a laboratory accident is very unlikely. But the director-general of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced there were still questions that ""will need to be addressed by further studies"".:Determining whether SARS-CoV-2 has escaped from a laboratory will require a more thorough investigation in which investigators have access to sequence databases as well as to the various resources used by Chinese researchers, including laboratory notebooks, submitted projects, scientific manuscripts, viral sequences, order lists and biological analyses. Unfortunately, sequence databases for SARS-CoV-2 have been inaccessible to scientists since September 2019. In the absence of direct evidence, alternative approaches may provide additional information. By analysing the available sequences of SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses in detail, it is possible that the scientific community will reach a consensus based on strong clues, as they did for other outbreaks, including the 1977 H1N1 virus.:Biological black boxesWhether the origin is zoonotic or not, it is necessary to question the consequences of our interactions with ecosystems, the industrialisation of intensive breeding, safety protocols on collecting and experimenting on potentially pandemic viruses, and the proliferation of high-security laboratories, particularly those near megacities.We need to equip facilities that study viruses with safety systems as demanding as those used for studying nuclear energy. This could include the introduction of ""biological black boxes"", similar to flight recorders which allow investigators to recreate the final moments of a plane accident. Access to certain high-risk labs could be made dependent on detailed digital descriptions of experiments; sequencing data could be systematically archived; laboratory air filters could be collected, and if there is a suspicion of pathogen dissemination, the genetic material on their surface could be sequenced.:Such new safety measures should be put in place internationally to limit the risk of future pandemics. As for SARS-CoV-2, it is important to trace its exact origins in order to understand precisely what flaws may have led to its spread.:Virginie Courtier, Directrice de recherche CNRS, genetique et evolution, Universite de Paris and Etienne Decroly, Directeur de recherche en virologie, Aix-Marseille Universite (AMU)This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

This rumor stemmed in part from a misleading article published on the web site Your News Wire under the inaccurate title ""Russia Put Black Lives Matter on Official Terror List,"" a title that was immediately contradicted in the article's first sentence, which reported that Russia was ""planning to"" (not that they already had) place BLM on a terror list::Russia are planning to place Black Lives Matter (BLM) on their 'terror list', officially recognising the group as a ""racist terrorist organisation"".The Federation Council is setting in motions plans to place BLM on the Federal Security Service's (FSB) ""Unified List of Organizations, Including Foreign and International Organizations That Have Been Recognized As Terrorist [Groups] By Russian Law"".However, no evidence supports the notion that Russia is planning to place Black Lives Matter on a terror list. Your News Wire sourced their information solely from a report published by the non-credible WhatDoesItMean.com conspiracy theory web site:The Investigative Committee (SLEDCOM) is reporting today that Valentina Matviyenko, Chairperson of the Federation Council, has initiated a legal inquiry as to placing on the Federal Security Service (FSB) ""Unified List of Organizations, Including Foreign and International Organizations That Have Been Recognized As Terrorist [Groups] By Russian Law"" an American ""racial-hatred"" group known as Black Lives Matter, its three founders, and two of its US billionaire funders.:As RationalWiki notes of WhatDoesItMean.com:Sorcha Faal is the alleged author of an ongoing series of ""reports"" published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don't think much of it. Each report resembles a news story in its style but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don't contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish.In this instance, WhatDoesItMean.com simply provided links to Sledcom and a list of groups recognized as terrorists by the Russian government, but neither of those sources mentioned anything about the Black Lives Matter movement. A common tactic among conspiracy theorist web sites is to overload the reader with information in an attempt to appear credible. The article published by WhatDoesItMean.com for instance, included dozens of links to outside sources, making it appear that the article was well-researched. However, none of these links led to web sites hosting any credible reports that the Black Lives Matter had been placed on a Russian terror list.:"

67,67,67,285.DidRogerStoneSellHil,"Claim:Roger Stone once marketed 'Hillary for Prison' merchandise. Rating:TrueAbout this rating President Donald Trump's longtime adviser Roger Stone spent much of the 2016 presidential campaign launching attacks against the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. His website StoneColdTruth.com and associated social media accounts are filled with memes and doctored images that portray Clinton as old, sick, or in prison. Stone also frequently posted messages on Twitter calling for Clinton's imprisonment and even started a petition advocating her prosecution that he shared with the hashtag #lockherup.:So when Stone was indicted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on seven charges in January 2019, including obstruction of an official proceeding, witness tampering, and making false statements, a number of people took to social media to note the irony of his arrest. Some of those messages included a photograph of Stone holding a ""Hillary for Prison"" T-shirt::We were unable to locate the original source of this image, the earliest version we could uncover being one included in a December 2015 article published on Vosizneias.com about Stone's joining a pro-Trump Super Pac:Roger Stone, who publicly parted ways with Trump's campaign in August, says he is supporting the Committee To Restore America's Greatness, which first filed paperwork with federal regulators in October.""I just really think this is something that needs to be done,"" said Stone, who has known Trump for decades and remained a vocal supporter, even after he left the campaign.The image appears to be authentic and was likely created to promote merchandise sold via the Infowars conspiracy theory website.  Stone sold a similar version of this shirt on his own website, Stone Cold Truth, accompanied by the caption ""Wear them loud, wear them proud and help get the word out that all of these globalist criminals, Republican and Democrat alike, should be held accountable for their crimes."":A federal magistrate judge on Friday ruled that longtime GOP operative and President Trump associate Roger Stone is not a flight risk and can be released on a $250,000 signature bond.Roger Stone vended ""Hillary for Prison"" merchandise, promoted the #lockherup hashtag, and circulated a petition calling for prosecution of the former U.S. secretary of state.

69,69,69,418.DoBatson2020USQuarte,"Claim:Bats are pictured on the reverse of a U.S. quarter issued in 2020, an indicator that COVID-19 is connected to a government plot.Rating:MixtureAbout this rating What's TrueThe reverse of a U.S. quarter issued in 2020 honoring the National Park of American Samoa features a pair of fruit bats.What's FalseSamoan fruit bats have no known connection to the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.:Snopes is still fighting an ""infodemic"" of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. Many theories have been advanced to explain the origins of the novel COVID-19 coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, ranging from the prosaic finding that it was merely a natural mutation to the conspiratorial claim that it was a bioweapon created in a Chinese laboratory. One much-discussed possibility was that the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus originated in bats and made the jump from bats to humans through an intermediate species.One of the more far-fetched conspiratorial takes on the coronavirus' origins held that the issuance of a new U.S. quarter in 2020 picturing bats on its reverse was a clue indicating that COVID-19 was ""government made"" as part of a plot to ""kill the masses and start a new world"":::The coin in question is part of the America the Beautiful Quarters(r) Program. Authorized by Congress in 2008, the series features 56 quarters released in batches of five per year from 2010 through 2020 (with one additional release at the beginning of 2021), each depicting a national park or other national site in a U.S. state or territory:The America the Beautiful Quarters(r) Program is authorized by Public Law 110-456 -- the America's Beautiful National Parks Quarter Dollar Coin Act of 2008. The Act directs the Mint to design, mint, and issue quarter-dollar coins emblematic of a national park or other national site in each state, the District of Columbia, and the five U.S. territories. As stipulated by the Act, the Mint is issuing five new quarters per year until 2020 in the order in which each honored site was first established, with the final coin released in 2021.:The design of the reverse of the America the Beautiful Quarter representing American Samoa was announced in 2019, and the coin itself was issued in 2020. That design represents the National Park of American Samoa and depicts a Samoan fruit bat mother hanging in a tree with her pup:National Park of American Samoa is located some 2,600 miles southwest of Hawaii and is one of the most remote in the U.S. National Park System. The site includes sections of three islands -- Tutuila, Ta'u, and Ofu. Almost all of the land area of these volcanic islands -- from the mountaintops to the coast -- is tropical rainforest. The park's area totals 13,500 acres, 4,000 of which are underwater.The obverse (heads) design features the familiar image of George Washington by John Flanagan, used on the quarter since 1932. It has been restored to bring out subtle details and the beauty of the original.The reverse (tails) design depicts a Samoan fruit bat mother hanging in a tree with her pup. The image evokes the remarkable care and energy that this species puts into their offspring. The design is intended to promote awareness to the species' threatened status due to habitat loss and commercial hunting. The National Park of American Samoa is the only park in the United States that is home to the Samoan fruit bat.:As far as this conspiracy theory goes, we would point out that the notion the novel coronavirus originated in bats is just one possible theory and remains unproven. And even if that were the case, it is exceedingly unlikely the virus started out in the Samoan fruit bat (Pteropus samoensis), which is found only in the Samoan archipelago and Fiji -- far from the virus' apparent origin point in China. We also note the improbability that a government engaged in the furtive mass eradication of citizens would plan years in advance to plant subtle clues warning the public of the plot.:"
