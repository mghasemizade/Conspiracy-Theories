0,0,344.WasDNCWorkerSethConr,"Claim:DNC staffer Seth Rich was gunned down to prevent him from meeting with the FBI over plans to testify against Hillary Clinton.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 10 July 2016, Democratic National Committee (DNC) staffer Seth Conrad Rich was shot and killed just after 4 AM in Washington, D.C. Rich's tragic death was undoubtedly destined to feed a number of conspiracy theories due to his line of work and the proximity of the 2016 presidential election. Among those theories were myriad conflicting claims that Rich was covertly working to expose election fraud, collaborating with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on an unspecified investigation, or a recycled assertion that he was imminently to testify against Hillary Clinton when he was gunned down. (No ongoing court case we could locate would involve any such testimony from Rich.):On 13 July 2016, the notoriously unreliable conspiracy-flogging outlet WhatDoesItMean.com hoovered up the fresh tragedy as part of what appeared to be a series of articles capitalizing on recent deaths to drive conspiracies about Hillary Clinton. Describing the 27-year-old Rich as a ""top"" DNC ""official,"" the site blared that he was bumped off by a Clinton ""hit team"":Assassination Of Top US Democratic Party Official Leads To FBI Capture Of Clinton ""Hit Team""A somber Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that a top American Democratic Party staffer preparing to testify against Hillary Clinton was assassinated this past Sunday during a secret meeting in Washington D.C. he believed he was having with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents, but who turned out, instead, to be a ""hit team""--and who, in turn, were captured yesterday after a running gun battle with US federal police forces just blocks from the White House. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]This SVR report, though, says that DNC official Seth Rich was ""lured/enticed"" to his murder by this Clinton ""hit team"" who portrayed themselves as FBI agents wanting to secretly interview him--and that the expelled Russian diplomats had given the US State Department ""electronic access"" to so that they could be found.Curiously, this report continues, US authorities, and while being able to track this Clinton ""hit team"" since 7 July, only confronted these assassins yesterday--and who before being captured, engaged in a gun battle with US federal police forces firing their fully automatic weapons before being trapped and surrendering just blocks from the US Capitol and White House.:In short, WhatDoesItMean.com held that Rich was under the impression he was to meet with FBI agents (at the bizarre hour of 4:00 AM) but in actuality had been set up for a fatal encounter with hit men working on behalf of Hillary Clinton. The site correctly quoted a D.C. Metro police press release, as we contacted the department and confirmed that release contained all known information about Rich's death:Detectives from the Metropolitan Police Department's Homicide Branch are investigating a fatal shooting that occurred in the 2100 block of Flagler Place, Northwest on Sunday, July 10, 2016.At approximately 4:19 am, members of the Fifth District were patrolling the area when they heard gunshots. Upon arrival on the scene, members located an adult male victim conscious and breathing, and suffering from gunshot wounds. The victim was transported to an area hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead.The decedent has been identified as 27-year-old Seth Conrad Rich, of Northwest, DC.:Police reported that Rich was conscious and breathing at the time of the shooting. Had he any information about his murder having been a set-up, he likely would have conveyed such to attending officer before he died of his wounds shortly thereafter. Contemporaneous news reports suggested that Rich's murder was indeed perplexing, as elements of the incident were dissonant with the appearance of a robbery gone awry:""If it was a robbery -- it failed because he still has his watch, he still has his money -- he still has his credit cards, still had his phone so it was a wasted effort except we lost a life,"" said Joel Rich, Seth's father.Immediately after that portion, the article quoted the elder Rich regarding the moments prior to his son's death. According to Joel Rich, Seth was on the phone with his girlfriend when the shooting started, and Rich indicated to his girlfriend that he was nearly home and not headed out for an FBI meeting implausibly scheduled in the middle of the night on a Saturday::Rich said Seth was talking to his girlfriend on the phone outside when the incident happened.""Asked him if he was home yet and he said just about, and then she heard some noise, he said he had to call her back -- I don't know when that conversation ended but at 4:18 two shots were fired,"" said Rich.According to Washington, D.C. television station WUSA, a string of robberies had occurred in the area where Rich was killed, and police believe that spate of crime was likely connected with his death. The station also reported that the 27-year-old staffer worked in voter expansion, helping people ""find their polling places""; Rich's age and the relatively minor scope of his duties made him an unlikely linchpin in a conspiracy involving election fraud or any purported testimony against Hillary Clinton. The young staffer had only been employed with the DNC, where he was a Voter Expansion Data Director, since 2014, making his position and tenure an unlikely match-up with possession of crucial information for which he was supposedly killed.:Metropolitan Police Department spokesperson Alice Kim said ""there is no indication that Seth Rich's death is connected to his employment at the DNC.""Slate also noted that the conspiracy theory version of Rich's death was lacking in both evidence and sense, yet WikiLeaks has since fanned the flames of speculation by offering a $20,000 reward for information about Rich's killer:Julian Assange and his WikiLeaks organization appear to be actively encouraging a conspiracy theory that a Democratic National Committee staffer was murdered for nefarious political purposes, perhaps by Hillary Clinton.Seth Rich was killed in Washington, D.C., in an early morning shooting that police have speculated was a failed robbery. Because Rich did voter outreach for the DNC and because we live in a ridiculous world, conspiracy theorists have glommed on to a fantastical story that Rich was an FBI informant meeting with purported agents who were actually a hit team sent by Hillary Clinton. There is of course absolutely zero evidence for this.The fact that the idea is so absurd, though, has not stopped Assange from suggesting that Rich was murdered for nefarious political purposes either because he was an informant for the FBI or because he may have been a source in last month's WikiLeaks release of thousands of DNC emails.:Rich's hometown newspaper, the Omaha World-Herald, also observed the lack of any substance to such rumors:Fevered political conspiracy theories about the death of Seth Rich have been swirling through online comment sections and websites ever since the Omaha native was gunned down early on July 10 close to his home in northwest Washington, D.C.All indications from police have been that Rich's death was most likely the result of a botched robbery -- a sadly too-common case of a promising young man cut down simply by being in the wrong place at the wrong time.But that hasn't stopped wild Internet speculation from going viral, based in part on the fact that Rich worked at the Democratic National Committee. Internet commenters have suggested that Rich was behind the disclosure of DNC emails to WikiLeaks that helped force the resignation of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida as chairwoman. The conspiracy theorists got new ammunition when WikiLeaks announced a $20,000 reward for information leading to a conviction in Rich's death.Never mind the evidence in favor of a robbery, the fact that the leaked emails were released well after his death or even that WikiLeaks itself stressed that the reward should not be taken as an implication that Rich was involved in the email leak.:A spokesman for the Rich family said that people ""attempting to politicize this horrible tragedy"" are ""causing more harm than good"":[S]ome are attempting to politicize this horrible tragedy, and in their attempts to do so, are actually causing more harm than good and impeding on the ability for law enforcement to properly do their job. For the sake of finding Seth's killer, and for the sake of giving the family the space they need at this terrible time, they are asking for the public to refrain from pushing unproven and harmful theories about Seth's murder.Rich was the second deceased individual ""connected"" to Clinton by WhatDoesItMean.com and the third inaccurately reported as endangered by the candidate. The same outlet falsely claimed hacker Guccifer (Marcel Lazar Lehel) was missing and presumed dead after he purportedly hacked into Clinton's e-mail, and just prior to that the site claimed former UN official John Ashe had been murdered on the eve of his providing scheduled testimony against Clinton. Guccifer was confirmed alive and well by officials at the facility in which he was housed, and a federal prosecutor's office affirmed Ashe's legal troubles were in no way connected to Clinton.:A common thread between the three rumors was a blogger known by the nom de plume ""Sorcha Faal."" RationalWiki describes Faal's WhatDoesItMean.com conspiracy site as ""sensational"" and ""outrageous"":Sorcha Faal is the alleged author of an ongoing series of ""reports"" published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don't think much of it.Each report resembles a news story in its style but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don't contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish.While it's true police maintain an open investigation into Seth Rich's death, the claim connecting him to Hillary Clinton was the third of its sort to emerge from the same conspiracy-monger in mid-2016. All those rumors were variations on the long-circulating (and false) ""body bags"" claims that the Clintons habitually do away with once-loyal associates turned political liabilities. Prior to publishing the trio of Clinton-related fabrications, the same site and blogger held that President Obama had ordered the military to nuke the city of Charleston (which didn't happen), that Rear Admiral Rick Williams was fired because he revealed Obama's purchase of a mansion in Dubai (Williams was actually terminated for misconduct), and that Vladimir Putin and Barack Obama were enmeshed in a potentially conflict-starting dispute over the practices of the Monsanto agribusiness corporation.:"
1,1,414.AreDoctorsandHospita,"Claim:Medicare is paying hospitals $13,000 for patients admitted with COVID-19 diagnoses and $39,000 if those patients are placed on ventilators.Rating:MixtureAbout this rating What's TrueIt is plausible that Medicare is paying hospital fees for some COVID-19 cases in the range of the figures given by Dr. Scott Jensen, a Minnesota state senator, during a Fox News interview.What's FalseHowever, Medicare says it does not make standard, one-size-fits-all payments to hospitals for patients admitted with COVID-19 diagnoses and placed on ventilators. The $13,000 and $39,000 figures appear to be based on generic industry estimates for admitting and treating patients with similar conditions.:Snopes is still fighting an ""infodemic"" of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. In mid-April 2020, social media users shared a meme implying that hospitals had a financial incentive to inflate the number of COVID-19 patients they were admitting in the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.The meme contained red text that said, ""So, hospitals get an extra $13,000 if they diagnose a death as COVID-19 and an additional $39,000 if they use a ventilator!"" and prompted readers to ask Snopes.com to verify whether the statement is true::The idea that hospitals are getting paid $13,000 for patients with COVID-19 diagnoses and $39,000 more if those patients are placed on ventilators appears to have originated with an interview given on the Fox News prime-time program ""Ingraham Angle"" by Dr. Scott Jensen, a physician who also serves as a Republican state senator in Minnesota.During the April 9, 2020 interview, Jensen suggested to host Laura Ingraham that he believed the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. was being artificially inflated. ""The idea that we're going to allow people to massage and sort of game the numbers is a real issue because we're going to undermine the (public) trust,"" he said.Ingraham then played footage from a press conference with comments from Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in which Fauci called claims that the number of coronavirus cases are being ""padded"" a conspiracy theory. In an exchange that followed, Jensen suggested that Medicare, the national health care plan for the elderly, was paying hospitals set amounts for each patient diagnosed and treated for COVID-19:INGRAHAM: Dr. Fauci was asked about the COVID death count today. Here's what he said, in part.[Cut to briefing]REPORTER: What do you say to those folks who are making the claim without really any evidence that these deaths are being padded, that the number of COVID-19 deaths are being padded?FAUCI: You will always have conspiracy theories when you have very challenging public health crises. They are nothing but distractions.[Cut back to Ingraham]INGRAHAM: Conspiracy theories, doctor? So you're engaging in conspiracy theories. What do you say to Dr. Fauci tonight?JENSEN: Well I would remind him that any time health care intersects with dollars it gets awkward. Right now Medicare has determined that if you have a COVID-19 admission to the hospital, you'll get paid $13,000. If that COVID-19 patient goes on a ventilator, you get $39,000, three times as much. Nobody can tell me after 35 years in the world of medicine that sometimes those kinds of things impact on what we do.:We attempted to reach Jensen by phone and email, but did not get a response in time for publication.We also reached out to the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to ask whether the statement that Medicare was paying hospitals $13,000 and $39,000, respectively, for patients admitted with COVID-19 diagnoses and patients with the disease who are placed on ventilators.A spokesperson for CMS told us that whether hospitals are paid by Medicare for care of a COVID-19 patient would depend on whether that patient was covered by Medicare insurance. CMS also told us there is no set or predetermined amount paid to hospitals for diagnosing and treating COVID-19 patients, and the amounts would depend on a variety of factors driven by the needs of each patient. Pay-outs would also depend on the variance of the costs of medical care in different regions.The closest match for the numbers cited by Jensen we could locate was in an April 7, 2020, article published by the health care nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. As a starting point to estimate how much hospitals might get paid by the federal government for treating uninsured COVID-19 patients, the article used average payments for hospital admissions for similar conditions in 2017: :For less severe hospitalizations, we use the average Medicare payment for respiratory infections and inflammations with major comorbidities or complications in 2017, which was $13,297. For more severe hospitalizations, we use the average Medicare payment for a respiratory system diagnosis with ventilator support for greater than 96 hours, which was $40,218.But while these industry estimates are similar to the numbers Jensen cited, they do not represent actual Medicare payments to hospitals for COVID-19 diagnoses or treatment, or even a national average of such payments. We therefore rate this claim ""Mixture."" While it seems plausible that Medicare disbursements to hospitals treating COVID-19 patients could be in the range given by Jensen in the Fox News interview (if those patients are covered by Medicare), we found no evidence to support Jensen's assertion that ""Medicare has determined"" that hospitals will be paid $13,000 for patients with COVID-19 diagnoses or $39,000 for COVID-19 patients place on ventilators."
2,2,337.DidCentnerAcademyinF,"Claim:A private school in Miami, Florida, sent a conspiracy theory-fueled email to parents saying its policy was to not employ anyone who was vaccinated for COVID-19.Rating:TrueAbout this rating Snopes is still fighting an ""infodemic"" of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. :On April 26, 2021, a private school in Miami, Florida emailed a letter to parents that singled out vaccinated staff, including teachers, according to news reports. Centner Academy, which opened in 2019 and reportedly ""charges almost $30,000 a year per student,"" said in the email that one of its policies is to not employ anyone who has been vaccinated for COVID-19.This was a true story. In fact, the Centner Academy website recently published an anti-vaccine news article on its website with the headline: ""Medical Freedom from Mandated Vaccines."" The page contained false and misleading information about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.Jim DeFede, an investigative reporter with Miami's CBS4, tweeted a copy of the letter that was sent to parents. The tweet was later removed, purportedly in violation of Twitter's rules.The letter was sent by school co-founder Leila Centner and followed a separate email sent to faculty and staff. The beginning of the email pushed a false and debunked conspiracy theory that claimed vaccinated individuals are dangerous to people who are unvaccinated. The Florida school also said that it has a policy that it would not employ teachers or other staff if they had received a vaccine::It was an eventful week that also included an important meeting among our faculty and staff where we shared the difficult decision that moving forward, until further notice, we ask any employee who has not yet taken the experimental COVID-19 injection, to wait until the end of the school year. We also recommended that all faculty and staff hold off on taking the injection until there is further research available on whether this experimental drug is impacting unvaccinated individuals. It is our policy, to the extent possible, not to employ anyone who has taken the experimental COVID-19 injection until further information is known.The email was filled with false and debunked conspiracy theories. For example, it claimed that no ""solid research"" exists on the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines.To be clear, COVID-19 vaccines went through rigorous testing and clinical trials. They have been deemed safe and effective by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The World Health Organization also said that the vaccines are both safe and effective.In a CBS4 investigation, reporters said they were told that ""one teacher has already resigned but it's not clear if it was in direct result of this policy."":The New York Times also reported that both of the school's founders, including Leila Centner and her husband, David, ""donated heavily to the Republican Party and the Trump reelection campaign, while giving much smaller sums to local Democrats.""In February, the Centners welcomed a special guest to speak to students: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the prominent antivaccine activist. (Mr. Kennedy was suspended from Instagram a few days later for promoting Covid-19 vaccine misinformation.)This month, the school hosted a Zoom talk with Dr. Lawrence Palevsky, a New York pediatrician frequently cited by anti-vaccination activists.We reached out to Centner Academy for a statement on the matter. A spokesperson emailed back and told us: ""The health and safety of our students has, and remains, our #1 priority at Centner Academy, the first happiness school in the US which draws on the latest research in the fields of mindfulness, emotional intelligence and the science of happiness."":The rest of the lengthy statement was filled with false and debunked conspiracy theories similar to those that were in the letter sent to parents.In sum, it was true that an anti-vaccine school in Florida told parents that it had a policy to bar teachers and other staff from being employed if they had received a vaccine."
3,3,109.NoJoeBidensWalkingBo,"Claim:U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's walking boot conceals a GPS ankle bracelet that monitors people under arrest.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In late November 2020, U.S. President-elect Joe Biden suffered a hairline fracture in his right foot, which occurred after he tripped playing with his German shepherd, Major. The injury required him to wear an orthopedic boot to protect the bone while it heals.:Perhaps inevitably, the appearance of the boot on Biden's foot spawned conspiracy theories. Various social media accounts stated they believed the boot hid a GPS ankle monitor, because Biden, they said, was under arrest.But this is just an iteration of other baseless claims sourced from the Qanon conspiracy theory, which posits that high-profile legislators and various celebrities are part of a child trafficking cabal. Other famous people and politicians alleged to have worn ankle monitors have been former President Barack Obama, actor Tom Hanks, and talk show hosts Ellen DeGeneres and Oprah Winfrey.Here's an example of a social media post claiming Biden's boot, and similar medical devices worn by other political figures, is an ankle monitor. We cropped this Twitter user's name out for privacy::Biden's doctor has confirmed the foot fracture in a statement, saying that he will need to wear a walking boot for several weeks during recovery.No evidence exists that Biden's orthopedic boot is anything other than that, and claims otherwise are part of a baseless conspiracy theory."
4,4,168.ZeroEvidenceDrBenjam,"Claim:A ""Dr. Benjamin Eidelman"" gave Buffalo Bills defensive back Damar Hamlin a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot days before he collapsed during a game.Rating:UnfoundedAbout this rating A baseless conspiracy theory is making the rounds about a person supposedly named ""Dr. Benjamin Eidelman,"" Buffalo Bills defensive back Damar Hamlin, and COVID-19 vaccine booster shots.Related: Did CDC Confirm That Thousands 'Died Suddenly' As a Result of COVID Vaccines?:On Jan. 2, 2023, Hamlin collapsed on the field during Monday Night Football, which led to the postponement of the Bills' matchup with the Cincinnati Bengals. The game was being played in Cincinnati.According to The Associated Press, Hamlin's heart stopped and he was still in critical condition as of the next day. He was being cared for at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center.Here's where the conspiracy theory comes in: A tweet purportedly sent by a ""Dr. Benjamin Eidelman"" claimed that just days before, Hamlin had received a COVID-19 booster shot. A great deal of misinformation has gone around purporting to connect instances of athletes collapsing and even dying during sporting events to COVID vaccines.A screenshot of a purported tweet from someone named ""Dr. Benjamin Eidelman"" was shared online soon after Hamlin's collapse. The account associated with that tweet has since disappeared. It did not show signs of having been suspended, as accounts that Twitter suspends for terms of service violations usually display an ""account suspended"" message. Rather, the page on which the account previously resided showed the words, ""This account doesn't exist."" This appeared to mean the account was removed by the user.:The tweet in the screenshot read as follows: ""I recently administered Damar Hamlin's Covid booster on 12/26, and as a medical professional, I can assure the public he passed all screenings with flying colors. I am in contact with the UCMC staff and will provide any assistance to them."" We found that the screenshot was shared by @catturd2 on Twitter, the right-wing blog The Gateway Pundit, and at least two times on the r/conspiracy subreddit on Reddit. All these sources expressed skepticism about the veracity of the tweet. (Twitter):We, too, found multiple reasons to doubt its veracity.First, the tweet provided zero sources.Second, the official medical information for Hamlin's condition that was released by the Bills said nothing about COVID-19 or any vaccines at all.:Third, and perhaps most glaring, the @drbeneidelman Twitter account was brand new. According to an archived capture on the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, the account was created in December 2022. The first known activity showed up on Dec. 17. This meant that the account was only two weeks old by the time the tweet screenshot made the rounds.Fourth, we found only one person online with the name Dr. Benjamin Eidelman. He was listed as a neurologist in Jacksonville, Florida, and is a much older-looking gentleman than the person pictured in the Twitter profile picture for @drbeneidelman. The Florida doctor appeared to simply have the same name as the likely-bogus Twitter account.There are more reasons to doubt that the tweet was real, such as the existence of medical privacy laws limiting what information health care providers can share about their patients, and the fact that there is no evidence nor any logical reason to believe that Hamlin was ever a patient of a Dr. Benjamin Eidelman.At its most base level, we don't recommend blind trust in tweets supported by zero sources or evidence of any kind.:We will update this story if any further information becomes available."
5,5,144.PatienceCarterIsaVic,"Claim:Orlando shooting victim Patience Carter is actually a ""crisis actor.""Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 14 June 2016, a video accusing a young woman who was injured during the mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando of being a ""crisis actor"" was posted to YouTube:: As with other false flag rumors, the above video provides absolutely no proof that Patience Carter was paid to act as if she had been injured during the Orlando shooting. Instead, the narrator takes an unrelated fact --  that Carter is an intern at a local news outlet -- and then shouts at length about the Pulse nightclub shooting being fake:""There she is. On Fox F***ng news. On Fox F**** news. There she is. Once again, the F****ng bullsh*t they are shoving down people's throats. We need to arrest all these people. This has gone way to far. They have pulled this out too many times. There has to be change. There's no way they can use this event. This is faked. This is staged. They are using actors. There is no doubt about it. This is 100% bullsh*t. At no point does the narrator explain why being an intern at WTFX (a Fox News affiliate, which is not the same as working for the network itself) automatically makes Carter a paid crisis actor. While the video provided no evidence to back up its wildly dangerous, insensitive, and extremely insulting claims, supporters of the conspiracy theory started posting images of Carter in an attempt to prove that she was involved in a false flag event. :Facebook user Darius Williams, for instance, posted a photograph allegedly showing that Carter had posted to her Instagram on 3:13 am on 12 June 2016, after she had been shot::While the image on the left-hand side of this graphic was indeed taken from Carter's Instagram page, the time stamp was manipulated. In other words, the user ""proving"" that Carter was a ""crisis actor"" faked the ""evidence"" that he used. The actual posting on Instagram lists the date as 11 June 2016. Twitter provided an even more accurate time stamp:The photograph used to ""prove"" that Patience Carter was a crisis actor was actually taken hours before the shooting started.  While this conspiracy theory is based off of unrelated facts and blatantly manipulated images, it is true that Carter is an intern at WTFX:FOX 29 has a personal connection to the Orlando shooting.We are sending our thoughts and prayers to our own 20-year-old Patience Carter,who was in the Pulse nightclub when Omar Mateen started shooting.:Carter, a New York University student, was on vacation in Orlando when she was shot in the leg during one of the deadliest mass shootings on American soil in recent history. Her friend, Akyra Murray, was killed in the attack. On 14 June 2016, Carter shared a poem, saying that she felt guilty for being alive:""The guilt of feeling grateful to be alive is heavy. Wanting to smile about surviving but not sure if the people around you are ready, as the world mourns the victims killed and viciously slain, I feel guilty about screaming about my legs and pain... Because I could feel nothing.  "
6,6,145.VerifiedUnofficialFo,"UPDATE: Following our reporting, YouTube removed the majority of the unofficial ""Fox News"" YouTube channels.On Sept. 15, a TikTok user posted a video about something strange that he noticed while looking at his phone. An altered Fox News video thumbnail with disinformation about U.S. President Joe Biden appeared in his YouTube ""Home"" feed. Videos on the channel showed thumbnails that falsely claimed Biden was either dying or going to jail, and that former U.S. President Donald Trump was coming back. The message was similar to a debunked QAnon conspiracy theory that recently led to federal authorities worrying of potential violence from Trump supporters when such disinformation inevitably failed to come true.Other thumbnails on the YouTube videos showed lower-third headlines including ""Trump Come Back,"" ""The End! Joe Biden,"" ""Bye Biden & Harris,"" and ""Good Bye Joe Biden, RIP Biden."" The video thumbnails were altered by the YouTube account holders in order to push disinformation.:'Fox News Alert'The YouTube channel mentioned in the TikTok video was named ""Fox News Alert."" It had a verification badge and close to 800,000 subscribers. A verification page is supposed to be somewhat of a trust signal so that users know the content is dependable. However, this was not an official Fox News YouTube account. A Fox News spokesperson confirmed this to us as well. The channel also did not appear to be managed from inside the U.S. :The thumbnails on these YouTube videos were the same design as seen in our previous investigation about a foreign disinformation network we uncovered on Facebook. In the story, we documented how several Facebook pages, groups, and accounts had spread altered videos from Fox News, One American News Network (OAN), and Newsmax. The same false claim about Biden going away and Trump coming back was pushed in the Facebook video thumbnails. In total, the clips on Facebook were viewed at least tens of millions of times. We published the story more than a month ago. Even so, the disinformation network is still active and thriving, despite the fact that Facebook has tens of thousands of employees and content review workers on the clock worldwide.The verified ""Fox News Alert"" YouTube channel seen in the TikTok video showed the YouTube username ""OrigamiTiengViet."" ""TiengViet"" referred to the Vietnamese language. It also offered memberships on YouTube, which included the ability to use emojis of Pepe the Frog, a character that The Guardian reported as ""referring to the cartoon adopted by white supremacists as a mascot."" The channel's owner added the emojis of Pepe the Frog, as this is a YouTube option that can be customized.:On Oct. 1, the YouTube channel was still available and appeared to have 883,000 subscribers, a higher number than it did when the TikTok video was recorded in September. However, its YouTube verification badge has since disappeared. It has also changed its channel name and likely updated the visibility of the political videos to unlisted or private.Second ChannelA second channel also named ""Fox News Alert"" was also not an official product of Fox News Channel. It was verified and had 485,000 subscribers. Google Translate identified the language of some of its older videos as Bengali. The channel used to go under the name Pocket Cinema24. We found no publicly visible political videos on this channel. As with the first channel, the visibility of such videos were likely changed to unlisted or private. This verified ""Fox News Alert"" YouTube account had 485,000 subscribers and might appear to a viewer to be an official channel for the cable news company.: Despite the fact that the political videos were no longer publicly available, we found a way to quantify the number of views they likely racked up. On the ""About"" page for the first channel with the username ""OrigamiTiengViet,"" YouTube showed close to 95 million video views for its total count. We counted the number of views on every publicly available video. Our total came to 72 million views, leaving 23 million views unaccounted for. This meant that it was possible that the political disinformation videos on this one unofficial ""Fox News Alert"" channel were viewed 23 million times.The second channel had nearly 100 million total video views. Some 98 million of those views appeared to be for non-political content, leaving around 2 million views unaccounted for. Both channels appeared to have been verified based on previous non-political content. It's possible that the accounts were purchased after building a large subscriber count. However, there was no proof of this.Millions of Subscribers:A search for more channels named ""Fox News Alert"" ended with a surprising number of results. A third YouTube channel with a Vietnamese name just started posting the same Fox News videos and altered thumbnails a week ago. In that short span of time, by our count, its disinformation political videos had already been viewed more than 360,000 times.We also found several other channels that were doing the same thing. One verified, yet unofficial, ""Fox News Alert"" channel had nearly 1.5 million subscribers. It has since changed its name to ""Funday,"" likely to cover its tracks. However, it still links to videos in its ""Community"" tab on another verified, yet unofficial, YouTube channel simply named ""Fox News."" Despite the verification badge and Fox News logos, this is not an official Fox News YouTube channel.:It's possible that this data on the disinformation network might only be the tip of the iceberg. The channels we uncovered totaled at least millions of subscribers and what appeared to be tens of millions of video views.We reached out to YouTube with several questions. In our email, we asked why the ""OrigamiTiengViet"" channel is still available if it recently lost its verification badge. We also inquired about when the accounts were verified and requested a statement on the company's disinformation policies. The company responded by our deadline and indicated that they were investigating the matter and may send over answers shortly. We will update this story when we hear back.Sources""Foreign, Pro-Trump Facebook Pages Post Altered Fox News Videos, Earning Tens of Millions of Views.""

7,7,474.DidaSecondGunmanShoo,"Claim:A second gunman fired at a crowd from the fourth floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino during the mass shooting in Las Vegas.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In the days immediately following the worst mass shooting in modern American history, in which 58 people were killed and 527 injured by automatic gunfire while listening to music at an outdoor festival on the Las Vegas Strip on 1 October 2017, disreputable web sites like YourNewsWire and NaturalNews.com immediately leapt at the ensuing chaos to push false conspiracy theories.:Police say that the shooting was perpetrated by Stephen Paddock, a 64-year-old resident of Mesquite, Nevada, who opened fire with a modified weapon from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. According to their ongoing investigation, Paddock acted alone. These findings can be easily verified by listening to police radio traffic from the incident, in which officers say they hear gunfire coming from the 32nd floor of the hotel, identify Paddock's room, then burst in, only to find him deceased inside with a large number of firearms.However, that has not stopped web sites with a less than nodding acquaintance with journalistic integrity from latching on to the mass casualty incident while taking advantage of the chaos and confusion to push conspiracy theories and collect resulting ad revenue. For example, on 2 October 2017, YourNewsWire, a web site that regularly inserts itself into tragedies to push the anti-semitic New World Order conspiracy theory, reported:The mainstream media narrative about the Las Vegas shooting has been debunked by two explosive videos provided to Your News Wire that confirm there were multiple shooters involved in a co-ordinated attack.Both videos show gunfire originating from the fourth floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel, much lower than the 32nd floor, where the mainstream media is claiming Stephen Paddock, a ""lone wolf"", fired on the crowd using an automatic weapon.[...]The answers are simple. The corporate media, controlled by a small, elite oligarchy, is operating on behalf of the New World Order, attempting to mislead the public into believing their enemies are their friends, and their friends are their enemies.:The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD), which is the lead law enforcement agency handling the investigation of the shooting, found 23 weapons in the hotel room with Paddock after breaching the door. They have determined he modified a semiautomatic rifle to make it shoot continuous rounds like a fully automatic weapon, and then he fired into a concert crowd from his perch in a 32nd floor suite at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. During a 2 October 2017 press briefing, LVMPD Assistant Sheriff Todd Fasulo took time to refute rumors that there was more than one gunman:I want to emphasize we believe Paddock is solely responsible for this heinous act. We are aware of the rumors outside of the media and also on social media that there was more than one assailant. We have no information or evidence to support that theory, or that rumor. We believe there was only one shooter and that was Stephen Paddock. We are doing a thorough investigation and only want to provide what is accurate to you. We will only give information that we have vetted and know to be true.The ""evidence"" provided by YourNewsWire and on other conspiracy sites like ZeroHedge.com is a widely-shared, roughly 35-second blurry YouTube video in which the narrators claims to have captured muzzle flashes coming from a room on the fourth floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel. The video can be viewed here::Despite what the narrator says, the video in fact does not show muzzle flashes from a nonexistent shooter on the fourth floor of the hotel. The most obvious evidence supporting this is that none of the windows on the hotel's fourth floor were broken (photographs show that Paddock had knocked out two windows in his suite, from where he had a birds-eye view of the crowd below). Another video tracked down by social media users shows the same light flashing an hour before the shooting started -- it can be seen twinkling on the right side of the screen in the below video as country band Big and Rich are singing ""God Bless America"" earlier in the night:The second video posted by YourNewsWire as ""proof"" of a second shooter on the fourth floor appears to have been taken by a cab driver who was near the hotel during the incident -- but while gunfire can be heard in her video, no muzzle flashes are in fact visible.According to police, Paddock fired on the crowd of 22,000 people from room 32135, a large suite in the north of the building. (The Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino is shaped like a three-sided star, and Paddock's room was situated as far north in the building as possible, while the Route 91 Harvest Festival he attacked was just northeast of the building and across the north-south thoroughfare Las Vegas Boulevard.):In emergency radio traffic, which can be accessed through the scanner-capturing web site Broadcastify, it is clear that responding officers initially didn't know where the shots were coming from, and were getting reports from witnesses that there may have been more than one shooter. Eventually, however, they were able to pin down the location. One officer can be heard saying:I'm inside the Mandalay Bay on the 31st floor. I can hear the automatic fire coming from one floor ahead -- one floor above us.Another officer seems to debunk the idea that there were muzzle flashes coming from the fourth floor, when he can be heard saying that he's seeing a strobe light flashing on the east wing of the building:I haven't seen any flashes from Mandalay, but if it is coming from Mandalay there is a strobe light coming from one of those windows on the east side.There is no evidence to support the claim that there were multiple shooters or that those shooters' muzzle flashes could be seen from the fourth floor of the resort. As we noted, police believe through their investigation that Paddock acted alone during the shooting. The YouTube video presented as evidence for this claim appears to show a strobe light in one of the rooms, as evidenced by footage that seems to show the same light flashing well before the shooting, and the observation by a police officer at the scene who said it was a strobe light.:The fact that police received reports from traumatized witnesses of multiple shooters in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy is not surprising, nor does it offer conclusive proof that there was more than one assailant, said Bill Flores, a retired assistant sheriff with the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. He told us:Right at the beginning [of the shooting] people thought it was fireworks. Then when they realized something horrific was happening and they were in fear, their frame of mind changes and they think, 'Maybe we did hear a second shooter.' Law enforcement officers should follow up on every type of report that comes in.Furthermore, radio traffic from incident makes it clear police officers were climbing the stairs of the building floor by floor, and it defies logic to believe they would not have heard automatic gunfire coming from the fourth floor, when they clearly heard it coming from Paddock's room.On 5 October 2017 LVMPD officer Larry Hadfield confirmed to us that per the investigation, Paddock has been identified as the lone shooter::We investigated. There was one single shooter. That's officialPolice radio traffic from the incident can be heard here:"
8,8,23.ConspiracyTheoriesWh,"This article about COVID conspiracy theories is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.We've all seen them. Those posts shared by friends of friends on Facebook, that jaw-dropping tweet you can scarcely believe was not immediately deleted. Alongside social distancing and Zoom meetings, it seems that one inescapable symptom of the pandemic is the proliferation of conspiracy theories on social media.Conspiracy theories are distinct from other forms of misinformation and falsehood. They are particular ways in which we make sense of the complex and sometimes disturbing world around us. They have also long been seen as a particularly political phenomenon. The American historian Richard Hofstadter famously referred to such ideas as underpinning a ""paranoid style"" of political thinking, replete with ""heated exaggeration, suspiciousness, and conspiratorial fantasy"".:A more recent understanding of their importance can be found in the work of the political theorist Alfred Moore, who suggests they are means of ""explaining events or phenomena in a way that is unwarranted, implausible, or even dangerous, invoking ever and deeper conspiracies and discounting all contradictory evidence"".In my work, I argue that over recent years we have seen the emergence of distinct forms of conspiracy theory, driven by structural changes in the way we communicate about politics. In order to understand the phenomenon, we need to think of conspiracy theories as part of a significant shift in the ways political participation happens in contemporary democracies.Filling a voidThere are a number of reasons why we are seeing conspiracy theories take hold in this way, and these have implications for our response to the pandemic which cannot be ignored.:It is well established that conspiracy theories are more prevalent in times of crisis. Research shows us that the popularity of these ideas is not constant, and peaks during cataclysmic events and social upheaval. Conspiracy theories were prominent during previous pandemics, including the Black Death, the ""Russian flu"" of the late 19th century and the 1918 flu pandemic.However, in contrast to past crises, recent conspiracy theories have been driven by the rapid change in how we communicate with each other. Of particular importance is the emergence of social media sites, which enable the rapid spread of information based on (superficially, at least) plausible information produced by what appear to be reliable sources. This context matters, in part because it allows a great degree of individual agency in the dissemination of conspiracy theories. Fundamentally, conspiracy theories of this kind are powerful because they are participatory. They engage people directly in the development and amplification of political ideas, however outlandish they might seem. In an environment when trust and confidence in political institutions are declining and engagement in democracy is highly unequal, this form of participation provides an easily-accessible and engaging alternative to mainstream forms of political participation. :There is an adage amongst online conspiracy theorists - do your own research. This encourages those involved to seek out validation of their ideas from sources which refute the ""official"" narrative. Engaging in contemporary conspiracy theories therefore has a game-like quality. People are encouraged to ""discover"" information promoted through their online networks rather than passively accept data and facts produced by established sources. Research tells us that any evidence presented to the contrary, no matter how compelling, is unlikely to be accepted, and indeed, might even be taken as evidence in favour of the conspiracy theory. More importantly, following these beliefs necessarily means adopting a distrustful orientation towards public institutions and scientific evidence.Facing factsThere is clear potential for conspiracy theories of this kind to undermine efforts to stop the spread of COVID and damage trust in vaccines. False arguments against vaccines are presented as an ""alternative narrative"" of equal status to scientific evidence. Attempts to expose the frailties of such a position are held to be evidence of vested interests on the part of state agencies and pharmaceutical companies. :Throughout, the participatory, gamified nature of the generation and spread of these ideas allows people to find a degree of stability in a confusing and unsettling time. Surely, part of the appeal that there is a ""plandemic"" is that there is, actually, a plan governing our lives rather than uncertainty at every turn. The dangers of such conspiracy theories for public health and our ability to navigate a path away from the current pandemic are real. In such an environment, it can be hard to know fact from fiction, with expertise and established sources of information refuted and rejected through social media. That we have not seen a coherent and credible response to this issue is therefore deeply worrying.:Numerous steps might be taken to address the problem. Rethinking the regulation of social media and removing the most prolific ""super-spreader"" social media accounts (including those of celebrities and public figures) has obvious potential. A senior figure in government might also be appointed to lead on addressing misinformation. However, any intervention  needs to be rooted in an understanding of the shifting context of political participation. Of course, there are difficult questions over how we ensure that we address these forms of conspiracy theory in a way that doesn't restrict the legitimate questioning of authority that is essential in any democracy. But it is imperative that as a society we recognise, and respond to, the sudden growth in conspiracy theories of this kind.:Rod Dacombe, Director of the Centre for British Politics and Government, King's College LondonThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

9,9,364.DidJohnMcAfeeHideFil,"Claim:John McAfee tweeted that he hid 31TB of files at the building near Miami, Florida, that collapsed in June 2021. Rating:FalseAbout this rating On June 23, 2021, software pioneer John McAfee was found dead in his prison cell, hours after a Spanish court approved his extradition to the United States to face various charges of tax evasion. After news broke, a number of conspiracy theories started to circulate online. Some claimed, for instance, that McAfee's ""$WHACKD"" tattoo indicated that the software pioneer did not take his own life. (You can read more about the tattoo here.) Some social media users also attempted to use McAfee's death to turn a tragic incident -- the collapse of a condo near Miami Beach, Florida, that has left at least four people dead and more than a hundred more missing -- into a conspiracy theory.:On Twitter, an image supposedly showing a message McAfee posted on June 8, 2021, was circulated with claims that Champlain Towers had been intentionally demolished to destroy files McAfee had hidden there. This claim was also attached to another message that claimed McAfee's alleged son, Pat McAfee, had an office at this building. :There is no evidence to support these claims.The above-displayed tweet does not appear on McAfee's timeline and appears to have been doctored. And while McAfee previously claimed that he had fathered 47 children, there are very few details to back up this assertion. Regardless, there doesn't appear to be any record of John McAfee having a son named ""Pat McAfee."" The person of this name who may be most familiar to American audiences, sports analyst Pat McAfee, is not McAfee's son and has already confirmed on Twitter that he does not have a condo in Florida.We were unable to find any record of the above-displayed alleged tweet, which reads ""If anything ever happens to me, please know that 31TB of files I have are located on hard drives in my condo near 88th Street and Collins Avenue Just north of Miami Beach,"" on McAfee's Twitter timeline. We were also unable to find any retweets or quote tweets of this message directing back to a deleted link.It's also highly unlikely that this message was posted and subsequently deleted from McAfee's account. Not only is there no trace of the original URL, but after McAfee's death, social media users archived hundreds of tweets that had been posted by McAfee, presumably because they thought the account could be deleted. We looked over those tweets on Archive.is and found no record of a message from McAfee saying that he hid files in the building that collapsed in Florida. :It should also be noted that there's no reason at present to suggest that the building in Surfside, Florida was intentionally ""demolished."" While an exact cause has not yet been determined, officials noted that there was no evidence of foul play.The Miami Herald reported on one possible cause for the building's collapse:Greg Batista, a professional engineer from Davie who specializes in concrete repair projects, said that after watching the Surfside condo tower collapsing to rubble in online videos, one potential structural flaw jumped out at him.""Concrete spalling."" Here's what it means.Batista said that when salt water seeps into porous concrete, it causes the reinforced steel rods known as rebar in the support beams to rust and expand. In turn, the expansion breaks up the concrete and that weakens the beams.As of this writing, the only connection between McAfee's death and the building collapse in Florida is that they both took place in June 2021. McAfee did not tweet that he was storing files in the building, and the claim that his alleged son ""Pat McAffee"" owned a condo in the building appears to have been conjured out of thin air.:"

11,11,586.ShaunKingRacialContr,"On Aug. 19, 2015, the website Breitbart published an article titled ""Did Black Lives Matter Organizer Shaun King Mislead Oprah Winfrey by Pretending to Be Biracial?"" That article (which began by introducing inevitable comparisons to controversial NAACP chapter leader Rachel Dolezal) began:An investigative blogger has accused Shaun King, a key figure in the Black Lives Matter movement, of misleading media icon Oprah Winfrey by pretending to be biracial in order to qualify for an ""Oprah scholarship"" to historically black Morehouse College. The blogger says King is white and has been lying about his ethnicity for years.As Breitbart stated, the claims were sourced from a virtually unknown website (Re-NewsIt!) and material by a blogger purportedly named ""Vicki Pate."" (Pate's work, aside from King's racial background, has included releasing autopsy photos of Georgia teen Kendrick Johnson, whose body was found in a rolled up wrestling mat in the gymnasium of Lowndes High School, and advocating for George Zimmerman, who fatally shot Trayvon Martin.)In her original post, Pate predicted King would ignore her assertions::I am anxious to see how King will try to spin this, if he addresses it at all. I tried to get in touch with his father for a comment before posting this blog. He was out and a neighbor said he usually takes off with his riding mower and she doesn't see him for a few days.Unlike Dolezal, King immediately acknowledged and addressed the controversy in an Aug. 19, 2015 series of tweets, but those tweets primarily dealt with ancillary matters (such as whether he was really the victim of a racially-motivated mob beating, whether he was seriously injured in an automobile accident, and the motivations of his accusers) and did not directly refute the claims about his racial identity (all or most of these tweets have been deleted):Actually, I'm going to keep doing what I've been doing and attack police brutality with every fiber in me. Hell, I'm doubling down now.It's going to me a second, but let me show you, on my terms, in my way, that what is happening today is a white supremacist conspiracy.:1. On August 28th, I'm launching @JusticeTogether to fight for the end of police brutality in America. That's NINE DAYS away. Follow me...2. Two days ago, @GlennBeck & @TheBlaze released this hit piece on me. [link] All lies. Every bit of it.3. In March of 1995, I was brutally assaulted by a racist mob of rednecks at my school. Guess what, they denied it.4. Seeing that @GlennBeck was willing to produce lies about me, a student who witnessed the who thing wrote this [link]5. It's also important that you see this ---> [link] Because other people who REALLY saw it commented on it there.6. Smelling blood in the water, @dailycaller and @TuckerCarlson wrote this piece about me. All lies. [link]7. So, when this was written ---> [link] showing the truth of what happened, I thought it was all over. It was to me.:8. Notice, even though a credible, reliable unbiased eyewitness AND TEACHER refuted @glennbeck they don't retract [link]9. Now, here is where it gets full-fledged white supremacist conspiracy theory crazy. It's wild.9. Breitbart (I'd actually never heard of them before) after seeing what @glennbeck & @dailycaller & @TuckerCarlson wrote, wanted in on it.10. But, having no journalistic standards at all, Breitbart decided to use a known white supremacist as their main source of info on ME.11. You need to know this name. VICKI PATE You won't find her on Twitter. PERMANENTLY BANNED for racist harassment [image missing]12. Here is Vicki Pate's website where, for a living, she harasses the families of black folk killed by police. [link]13. So, this woman literally stalks my children. Speaks of them by first name on her blog, studies their medical history, etc.:15. First, Breitbart has 3 main sources. Vicki Pate (a known white supremacist) and @TheBlaze & @TheDailyCaller (who we already refuted).16. Breitbart claims I was never in a car accident. That's me. That's the car. The story: [link]King's rebuttal continued on Twitter. The evidence proffered by those asserting his claims to mixed-race heritage included: A family photograph reportedly posted to Facebook by Shaun King's brother showing a child said to be Shaun looking like a white toddler with curly red hair::An image presented as a copy of a police report involving a 15-year-old Shaun King that listed his race as ""white"":Reports from Re-NewsIt! and Breitbart maintained that Shaun King's birth certificate ""names a white man as his father,"" although the posted Certified Record of Birth simply lists the names of King's parents and not their races. Those sources used the Certified Record of Birth to find King's father's name (Jeffery Wayne King), then sought other records referencing that name to identify King's father's race::The Daily Beast similarly reported that public records identified the race of Shaun father's race as white::Prominent Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King said for years that he is biracial, because he was born to a white mother and a black father, but Kentucky public records reviewed by The Daily Beast show that King's father is white. Jeffery Wayne King, born Nov. 11, 1955, is listed as Shaun King's father on his birth certificate. Criminal records identify Jeffrey King's ethnicity as white.An image stated to be a mug shot from the arrest of Jeffery Wayne King showed a man who appeared to be white (but not definitively)::However, Back on 30 July 2015 (before both Pate and Breitbart accused him of fabricating his racial identity), King posted a high school photograph of himself from 1995 in which many viewers concurred he looked like a bi-racial youth:  Throwback. 1995. Sophomore in high school. Karl Kani shirt. Gold chain. Part. [image missing] -- Shaun King (@ShaunKing) July 30, 2015On 20 August 2015, Shaun King released a statement in which he suggested that the man listed on his birth certificate as his father was not in fact his biological father; rather, his father was a light-skinned black man with whom his mother had an affair:I refuse to speak in detail about the nature of my mother's past, or her sexual partners, and I am gravely embarrassed to even be saying this now, but I have been told for most of my life that the white man on my birth certificate is not my biological father and that my actual biological father is a light-skinned black man. My mother and I have discussed her affair. She was a young woman in a bad relationship and I have no judgment. This has been my lived reality for nearly 30 of my 35 years on earth. All of my siblings and I have different parents. I'm actually not even sure how many siblings I have. It is horrifying to me that my most personal information, for the most nefarious reasons, has been forced out into the open and that my private past and pain have been used as jokes and fodder to discredit me and the greater movement for justice in America. I resent that lies have been reported as truth and that the obviously racist intentions of these attacks have been consistently downplayed at my expense and that of my family.:We spoke to King directly about background information which emerged in the intervening weeks and months after the August 2015 Breitbart-initiated controversy. King stated that at the time our article was initially published, he was overwhelmed by an avalanche of media inquiries and maintained that while many in the public sphere knew him only as a Black Lives Matter activist, his interpersonal connections were older and more through (making the claims plausible to folks who only recently came to know King through news of his activism):""I have been a fairly well known figure in close circles for the past 20 years, most of the country just came to know me in the past 18 months.""Primarily at issue, King maintained, was partial reporting of statements made to the media in 2015 by the police officer who checked the ""white"" box on the above-reproduced 1995 police report. King indicated that that officer's statements were deceptively edited in most media reports, and forwarded us a link to an unedited version of the officer's statement. King recapped the allegation::I was very badly assaulted all the way back in March of 1995 in my high school. The detective placed on the case was a actually a very good man named Keith Broughton. [Opponents of the Black Lives Matter movement] used his police report, which marked me as white, as a primary piece of evidence that I am white. I didn't check the box, he did ... I was 15, and this was in 1995. All the way back then it was widely known in my small town that I wasn't white. His statement came from this interview [page no longer exists].As King asserted, Broughton's statement to IJReview undermined claims the officer believed King was white; moreover, that statement was not widely reproduced in the broader coverage of allegations King wasn't black. In that August 2015 statement, Broughton told IJReview King's race was widely understood to be mixed but no box existed for ""biracial"":I believe that he's biracial. I could just tell when I saw him. I marked him white because he's very light complected. He was there with his white mother. My crime report there's only two things you can check: black or white. It doesn't say biracial ... anyone from around here who knew him knew he was mixed.:As Broughton stated, box #33 on the above-reproduced form indeed listed only ""white"" or ""black"" as options in 1995; in 2015 (or 2016) options such as ""Hispanic,"" ""Asian or Pacific Islander,"" and ""other"" were common on standardized forms (and likely assumed by many readers to be common two decades prior as well). King stated that he later spoke to Broughton about the controversy, and that Broughton affirmed ""[h]e told [King] specifically that [Broughton] told this same thing to [other] outlets, but they just didn't mention it.""We investigated King's claim that Broughton's complete statement was absent from contemporaneous reporting, and were unable to locate any other iterations of the quote. Most reports contained the above-reproduced police report, but none we located included the ancillary, current statements from Broughton indicating that both at the time of the 1995 and in 2015, he believed King was biracial. Finally, King pointed us to one of several statements made from classmates of his at the time of the controversy. One was shared in a screenshot to his Facebook page, and was written by a female childhood friend who maintained the claims were absurd based upon her youthful acquaintance with King:::As King asserted, a number of these details were buried in the initial media brouhaha stemming from the Breitbart post. However, aside from photographs, the sole ""evidence"" upon which the claims King fabricated a racial identity were based hinged on a police report from 1995 describing him as white. Exculpatory statements made by Broughton at the time of the controversy may not have been deliberately elided from contemporaneous coverage, but nevertheless were absent from nearly all articles containing the police report.When Broughton's August 2015 statement was taken into consideration, the sole remaining evidence of King's purported fabrication hinged on photographs in which he appeared to possibly be white; however, biracial individuals historically ""passed"" as one race or another depending on circumstances (or even incidentally). While King appeared to be white in some early photos, he also appeared to be biracial or black in separate photos from his youth shared prior to the controversy.[Updated 12 January 2016]:"
12,12,115.NoDemocratsandBidenD,"Claim:U.S. President Joe Biden, and other prominent Democrats, engage in harvesting the blood of children as part of a liberal, globalist conspiracy of satanic child sacrifice.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In July 2021, we received several inquiries from Snopes readers regarding remarks that U.S. President Joe Biden made about baseless QAnon-related conspiracy theories which posit that Democrats and political progressives, as a group, ""suck the blood of children."":During a CNN townhall event in Cincinnati, Ohio on July 21, host Don Lemon asked Biden about the partisan rancor surrounding efforts by congressional Democrats to set up an inquiry into the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, and struck a pessimistic note about the broader prospects of bipartisan collaboration, asking Biden: ""If Republicans and Democrats can't come together -- right? -- to investigate the biggest attack on our Capitol in 200 years, what makes you think that they can come together on anything?""In response, Biden spoke about misinformation around the events at the Capitol on Jan. 6, and the role of misinformation and conspiracy theories in deepening mutual misunderstanding and conflict between Democrats and Republicans in the United States. A video of the exchange can be watched below, but the following is an edited transcript of Biden's response:The fact is, you can't look at that television and say, ""Nothing happened on the 6th.""  You can't listen to people who say this was a ""peaceful march."" ...I've been through the other end of this when the Democrats, 35 years ago, were way off to the other side. ...I have faith in the American people -- I really do -- to ultimately get to the right place. And, by the way, many times Republicans are in the right place.  I don't mean that the Repub- -- that it's always the Democratic point of view.  But some of the stuff -- I mean, QAnon: The idea that the Democrats or that Biden is hiding people and sucking the blood of children and -- no, I'm serious.  That's -- Now, you may not like me, and that's your right... But the kinds of things that are being said of late, I think you're beginning to see some of the -- and both -- and by Democrats as well -- sort of the venom get -- sort of -- sort of leak out a lot of it.  We got to get beyond this. :Biden was referring to a set of false claims, linked to the QAnon cluster of conspiracy theories, that ""globalist elites"" including Biden, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and other prominent figures in progressive politics, the news media, and the Democratic party, engage in mass satanic ritual child abuse, including drinking the blood of children. Such claims are utterly false.:During the 2020 presidential election campaign, followers of those theories predominantly supported outgoing President Donald Trump, whom they largely viewed as a tacit supporter or even leader of their (QAnon's) movement, and vehemently opposed Biden, whom they viewed as either complicit, or an active participant in, the nonexistent liberal conspiracy of child sacrifice. In context, then, the sense of Biden's remarks at the CNN townhall in July 2021 was clear, and he was making the perfectly uncontroversial point that while he strongly supports bipartisan collaboration on important matters of policy and procedure, such collaboration is made much more difficult in light of what he regards as misinformation and disagreement about basic facts -- for example, in relation to the events of Jan. 6 -- and the fact that a non-trivial cohort of those who typically vote for Republican House and Senate candidates, believe Biden and other Democrats are engaged in the worst kind of ritual child abuse imaginable. Biden made another reference to the ""drinking children's blood"" theory, while speaking to reporters upon his return to the White House after the CNN townhall on July 21. Shelby Talcott, from the right-wing Daily Caller website, asked Biden about the Democratic position on police reform and the ""defund the police"" movement.:It's important to note that Biden has long since repeatedly clarified that he opposes efforts to ""defund the police,"" and prominent congressional Democrats including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have also pushed back against that movement, popular among some left-wing activists within the Democratic coalition. A video of the brief exchange between Talcott and Biden can be viewed here. Below is a transcript:Talcott: Mr. President, can you clarify what you said about no -- that there's no -- no one in the Democratic Party is anti-police?Biden:  I didn't say that.Talcott: I know that you said you don't want to defund the police --Biden: I said that that -- that is not the Democratic Party's position. Talcott: Okay.Biden: I'm the Democratic Party; I am President.  So is the Speaker of the House and so is the -- the Majority Leader.  We are not the defunding the police.Talcott: Okay.  And are there people who -- in the Democratic Party, who want to defund the police?Biden: Are there people in the Republican Party who think we're sucking the blood out of kids?Talcott: I'm not sure...Biden: [Laughs and walks away].:In context, the sense of Biden's remarks was again clear in this second instance. After Biden made it clear that he and other leaders within the Democratic Party are opposed to defunding the police, Talcott again asked whether some people within the party favored that policy.Biden retorted by asking whether some people within the Republican Party supported the belief that Biden and other Democrats were engaged in child blood harvesting, making the point that controversial views among some party members was not the sole province of the Democrats, and also that those prevalent on the fringes of the GOP were much more destructive and outrageous. One can dispute the accuracy of that argument, but the point being made by Biden was clear and, in itself, coherent.Despite this context, and despite the fact that ""child sacrifice,"" ritual child abuse, and ""blood harvesting"" theories were a highly publicized and widely reported fringe feature of the 2020 presidential election (Trump himself even promoted the false claim that Biden was a pedophile), several right-wing commentators expressed apparent bafflement at Biden's references to ""sucking the blood of children,"" and some described the president as being ""obsessed"" with the subject, thus passively promoting the underlying conspiracy theory of Biden's personal involvement in child sacrifice. :'Perhaps His Answer Is Part of Some Weird Fantasy'For example, on July 23 the right-wing, pro-Trump commentator Benny Johnson, a known source of politically-motivated disinformation, posted a video to Facebook with the headline ""Biden rants about sucking children's blood at the White House,"" a formulation of words which could quite foreseeably promote the outrageous conspiracy itself, because it conspicuously did not make clear that Biden was referring critically to the belief in the conspiracy theory, among some Republicans, rather than ""ranting about sucking children's blood"" itself. The video was also accompanied by a mocked-up photograph of Biden with vampire fangs::Johnson said the president's exchange with Talcott was evidence that he is ""clinically unwell,"" but speculated he may have been referring to ""some fringe QAnon conspiracy theory that no one's ever heard of,"" even though it was widely reported during the 2020 presidential election campaign, and evidently well known enough for Johnson himself to quickly make the obvious connection, which was made even more obvious by the fact that, earlier that same evening, Biden had already explicitly referred to it as a ""QAnon"" theory.Similarly, former Trump campaign attorney Jenna Ellis tweeted out a video clip from the exchange with Talcott, along with the text:  ""Anyone else concerned how obsessed Joe Biden is with sucking blood out of kids?"":Again, this characterization grossly misrepresented the fact that Biden was, for the second time in one evening, citing the existence of a right-wing conspiracy theory about child sacrifice to make a broader point about the difficulties of bipartisan consensus, rather than articulating a personal fixation on the fictional practice of blood harvesting itself. By reframing Biden's remarks in this way, and describing him as ""obsessed,"" Ellis' tweet likely served to further promulgate the underlying conspiracy theory, namely that Biden himself is personally involved in drinking children's blood. Likewise, the conservative website Red State called Biden's remarks ""creepy"" and speculated: ""Perhaps his answer is part of some weird fantasy he's been suppressing...""If, at first glance, Biden's remarks appeared odd, that's because the conspiracy theory to which he was referring is, itself, exceedingly weird. In bringing it up on July 21, Biden was highlighting a real, widely known and highly publicized conspiracy theory, popular among a vocal cohort of right-wing Americans and supporters of Trump, as an example of the kind of rhetorical excesses that have taken root among sections of the right in recent years, as well as an inflammatory set of allegations that, for obvious reasons, has the potential to constitute a two-way obstacle to bipartisan cooperation. :Any response or commentary that expresses bafflement or concern about the sense of Biden's remarks must therefore be indicative of either blatant intellectual dishonesty, or an unfortunate lack of basic knowledge about political rhetoric in the United States in the past few years.Finally, Snopes itself was caught up in the wave of reactions to Biden's remarks. On July 23, Kyle Mann, editor-in-chief of the self-described satirical website the Babylon Bee, tweeted out what appeared to be a screenshot from a Snopes fact check of the claim ""Do Democrats suck the blood of children?"" along with the rating ""Mostly False.""Mann added: ""Well that's a relief,"" with the point being that any rating other than ""False"" would seem to imply there was, rather worryingly, an element of truth to the claim that Democrats ""suck the blood of children""::Of course, the screenshot was entirely bogus, and there is not an iota of truth to that claim. Snopes had not published any such fact check at the time Mann posted his tweet, and this fact check carries an unequivocal rating of ""False."""
13,13,598.HowaRetiredScientist,"1. THE CURECancer, in all its forms, has been cured. This remains a perceived truth in the corners of the Internet where supplements and conspiracy theories are peddled. A particular cure named GcMAF (short for ""Gc protein-derived macrophage activating factor,"" which is a chemically altered form of a natural protein that allegedly stimulates the activity of a specific kind of white blood cell) ""has the potential to be a universal cure for cancer"", the alternative health and 9/11 Truth website Natural News proclaimed in July 2015.""[GcMAF] is also believed,"" the web site also reported, ""to be capable of treating and reversing autism, HIV, liver/kidney disease and diabetes."" Rumor has it that GcMAF has the potential to be a cure for even more diseases, such as herpes, as well.GcMAF's promise as a cure for cancer (and more) has caught up not only those who frequent fringe medical sites online, but also those seeking to profit from it. In 2009, an Israeli pharmaceutical company purchased the intellectual property behind the GcMAF therapy, and since around 2010 at least three companies have been promoting, have sold, or are currently selling, some version of the cure. The founder of one of the most prominent of those companies, David Noakes of Immuno Biotech Ltd., will soon be appearing in court to face charges that include conspiring to manufacture a medicinal product without a license.:Although GcMAF is not approved for use as a medical treatment in the United States, some American doctors still promote or discuss its use through their practices' web sites. Hundreds of pages of online message board conversations document online conversations between gravely sick people wondering if, perhaps, this storied cure will be the one that finally saves them. Inevitably, these conversations end up pointing to shady web sites purporting to sell the GcMAF cure.An international crackdown on the promotion and sale of this ""wonder cure"" in late 2015 pushed its promoters deeper and deeper into the fringes of the Internet, allowing GcMAF to become the original basis for a wildly incoherent (and completely false) conspiracy theory about ""holistic doctors"" being murdered by some ill-defined cabal of nefarious government agents furtively working on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry.""A breakthrough cancer treatment appears to be the reason why a handful of holistic doctors were recently found 'suicided,'"" trumpeted Health Nut News founder Erin Elizabeth in August 2016. ""Haven't heard about GcMAF as a viable cure against cancer?"" Natural News asked, with an answer already in mind. ""That's because none of their studies became widely known until the doctors themselves started dying."":In a sense, GcMAF is the perfect cure to appeal to the Internet's pseudoscientific alternative health underbelly, even if that audience was perhaps not GcMAF's original target. On these web sites, the primacy of ""natural"" cures over man-made ones reigns blindly supreme, and one of the most popular tropes used by these sites to play into that narrative is that a ""supplement"" (which is how GcMAF is typically marketed) is a tool that allows your body to do the dirty work of curing what ails you without the need for any of those nasty man-made pharmaceuticals. That, in theory, is what GcMAF is supposed to do.GcMAF, according to those promoting that cure, is a chemically altered form of a molecule naturally found in human blood that, when injected into the bloodstream, stimulates the activity of macrophages, a crucial form of white blood cell that can (in essence) ingest a variety of foreign substances found in the bloodstream or in other tissues they migrate to.There is one other chemical crucial to the purported mechanism behind GcMAF: an enzyme dubbed NaGalase. The idea behind it, as presented primarily by the work of a single scientist, is that cancerous cells (and other diseases) are capable of shutting down macrophage activity by releasing this enzyme. That enzyme makes those macrophages dormant, the argument goes, thereby making it harder for your body to fight a cancer and other ailments. Inject your body with some GcMAF, and these macrophages escape their ""zombie"" state and get right to work -- or so its promoters claim.:In scientific studies, GcMAF's efficacy has been tested by using NaGalase as an indicator for cancer load or other ailments, with a decrease in NaGalase being a sign of efficacy. In a fairly open and shut case of circular logic, however, both GcMAF, and the NaGalase test that is meant to monitor GcMAF therapy, were patented by the same man: Dr. Nobuto Yamamoto.2. THE PIONEERIt would be easy, looking at the claims made of his research, to dismiss the self-described pioneer of GcMAF as a snake oil salesman, but a deep dive into his career does not offer such an easy out. Dr. Yamamoto, now 92 years old and (as he told us over the phone) still actively engaged in research, has had what can easily be described as a long and very productive career as a scientist. With a publishing record going back at least to 1957 to the present, he has seen his work published in some of the world's most prestigious scientific journals, including a 1964 paper in Science and multiple papers in Proceedings in the National Academy of Sciences.Dr. Yamamoto, who holds a PhD in biochemistry from Gifu University in Japan, has been a US-based researcher since 1959, when he was invited to be a visiting associate researcher at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. He was later hired as a biophysics and biochemistry researcher at the National Institute of Health in Maryland before becoming associated, in multiple capacities, with Temple University in Philadelphia until 1980. He then took a post at the Hahnemann University School of Medicine, now a part of Drexel University (also in Philadelphia).:In 1987, as a professor at Hahnemann, Dr. Yamamoto published a paper in the journal Cancer Research that would become the basis for the concept he later termed GcMAF. He officially left academia in 1993, but then took a post at a private hospital named the Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia, and it was there that he began focusing myopically on GcMAF, publishing a number of early papers relevant to GcMAF.:One paper co-written by Yamamoto and published in 1996 listed a woman named Sucha Asbell (a former medical student in Philadelphia and now a radiation oncologist at Cooper Health) as a co-author. When we contacted Dr. Asbell about the paper, she told us by telephone that she did briefly work with Yamamoto, supplying him with blood samples from cancer patients under her care at the request of a superior, but had been unaware that authorship credit for the paper in question had been attributed to her until an NGO that investigates fraudulent cancer cures raised concerns about the research in 2014. Asbell, who described Yamamoto as having been a ""bit of a wacko"", said she didn't know when or why Yamamoto parted ways with the Einstein Medical Center, but she told us she had heard rumors that he ""left in a huff.""It is clear, at the very least, that Yamamoto ran into serious problems with the administrators at Einstein around that time. Although a media representative for Einstein initially denied to us that any records supported the claim that Yamamoto had ever worked for them, a human resources representative there later confirmed to us that Yamamoto's employment, which began in June 1993, was terminated in June 1999. A variety of partial or unverified accounts of why this may have happened, but no definitive answers, have been offered.:Allegations of misconduct were leveled against Yamamoto, charges which were damaging enough for Yamamoto to respond by filing a lawsuit against both Einstein and their then-Director of Research and Technology Development for ""libel, slander, and misrepresentation."" Yamamoto himself told us that Einstein's then-director of cancer research was ""a very bad person"" who was trying to eliminate superior researchers from the facility for his own gain, and that he himself had never sued Einstein or anyone else over his termination because it would have been too much work. However, we were able to obtain a court docket indicating that Yamamoto was indeed the plaintiff in a libel suit filed against Einstein's Director of Research, which was eventually settled out of court. (The complete records of that case were destroyed in 2004.)In correspondence between Yamamoto and the editor of the journal Translational Oncology regarding the concerns raised by an investigation into his work (which we were able to obtain), Yamamoto seemed to suggest that claims of misconduct leveled against him were genuine but were, in his view, unrelated to research practices and ultimately the result of a financial misunderstanding::We found no definitive proof that Yamamoto was fired from his position at Einstein for any kind of misconduct, although the lawsuits he filed against his former employer suggest that he was portrayed in a negative way to which he objected, and that around that time his employment was terminated. Einstein would not confirm the details of Yamamoto's termination or acknowledge the lawsuit, and although we sent multiple requests for comment to an individual listed as a defendant in that case, we received no response.:Nonetheless, it was around the time that Yamamoto left Einstein that he began to describe himself as director of the Socrates Institute, which is located in his home. His six-year publication hiatus ended in 2006 with his paper about the utility of NaGalase as an indicator of progress for AIDS treatment, and beginning in 2008 he published the four papers most frequently cited in favor of GcMAF's efficacy against both AIDS and cancer.The most notable of these papers, published in the International Journal of Cancer, claimed metastasizing breast cancer cells had been successfully destroyed with GcMAF. Another 2008 paper, this one published in Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy, claimed that GcMAF was effective as a treatment for colorectal cancer. A 2009 paper published in the Journal of Medical Virology, made the astounding claim that HIV-infected patients were ""rapidly cured"" by GcMAF therapy. The inclusion of these three papers in scientific literature would be short lived, however.By 2015, these papers had all been retracted by the journals that published them, thanks to the work of the Anticancer Fund, a Belgian-based NGO that ""investigates the information on cancer therapies for evidence, so that evidence-based treatment choices can be made"", according to their website. ""After several patients asked our organization [...] about GcMAF as a cancer treatment, we decided to look for the evidence supporting its use in cancer,"" they told the academic watchdog Retraction Watch in a July 2014 article.:The Anticancer Fund's main scientific problem with the research behind those papers, laid out in a statement posted on their web site, was that the researchers did not actually measure tumor growth or decline directly but instead relied on NaGalase, which the researchers had claimed as an accurate measurement of tumor load in a human body even though it is not widely accepted as a valid analytical tool for this purpose. Nonetheless, it wasn't those scientific concerns that lead to the retractions of Yamamoto's papers: the main issue was that little (if any) independent documentation existed about the patients involved in the studies or their approval for participation in medical trials. The official justification for each of these retractions, according to statements provided by the respective journals, was that they were due to ""irregularities in the documentation for institutional review board approval"". In essence, this meant the journals felt the papers' authors could not adequately prove that their trials had been approved by any academic board, or had been conducted in the manner claimed in those authors' subsequent papers.3. THE INSTITUTEWe spoke to Ana Ugarte, a doctor and medical researcher involved in the Anticancer Fund's investigation of GcMAF, about the issues that resulted in the retraction of the three papers prepared by the Socrates Institute. Contrary to the muted and official tone taken by the Anticancer Fund, the process behind the investigation led Ugarte, and later us, down what can only be described as an increasingly absurd rabbit hole.Although the Anticancer Fund never explicitly made such a claim in any of their official publications, Ugarte personally suspected that the Socrates Institute, which shares the address of Yamamoto's private home and was established as tax-exempt organization in November 1998, was, by and large, a made-up entity. Perhaps the most consequential aspect of Socrates Institute revolved around a man named Hirofumi Suyama, who retired from the Nagasaki Medical school in 1987. Although Suyama was credited as an author in a number of Socrates publications and was listed on tax documents as vice director of the Socrates Institute in 2007, Suyama had not published anything since 1991.:The Anticancer Fund's Ugarte tried fruitlessly to get in touch with this man, but according to Yamamoto, Suyama died in July of 2011 (although tax documents listed him a vice director of Socrates in 2011). Yamamoto did not directly confirm Suyama's death to us (and we have been unable to independently verify whether Suyama is dead or alive), but he used Suyama's passing as an explanation for a lack of complete documentation regarding the approval of the clinical trials he published data from to the editor of Translational Oncology.Suyama's inclusion as an alleged participant in the Socrates Institute, as well as his death, are suspiciously convenient to Yamamoto, as he appears to be using the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval from a place where Suyama once worked to claim that the clinical trials from which Yamamoto generated his data were legally conducted. (A committee such as the IRB is formally designated by a university to approve and monitor the ethics of research on humans.)The IRB which Yamamoto claims signed off on his research was allegedly convened in 1995 at a research institute in Japan. As far as we can tell, however, the only documentation of this review committee is the cover page of a press release Yamamoto provided to editors of Translational Oncology (below) when asked to document his IRB approval. Additional details of this review process appear to have died with Suyama -- at least, according to Yamamoto.::Echoing the concerns of the Anticancer Fund, Dwight McKee, an oncologist with an interest in integrative and alternative treatments for cancer who began to work with Yamamoto on clinical trials of GcMAF around 2009, told us he was unnerved by some of the ethical decisions Yamamoto was making.McKee told us that, for the medical trial he was collaborating on with Yamamoto (whose data he said were not published), Yamamoto was attempting to register American stage four cancer patients for a medical trial using IRB approval from a foreign institution. McKee told us that he had his own lawyer look into the legality of entering patients ""on an informed consent, clinical trial, through a foreign university"" and found that it was a grey area but ""probably not completely defensible."" McKee said he thought at the time that he and Yamamoto were conducting a legal and legitimate clinical trial, but, he said, ""it was much fuzzier than that"". The two parted ways after these revelations.Aside from these ethical concerns about research methodology, it appears that many members listed as both authors and directors at the Socrates Institute actually had little, if anything, to do with that organization. Suspicions of potentially deceased people working for the Socrates Institute are not limited to Dr. Suyama: Socrates' 2011 tax filing also lists Theodore Sery, a collaborator with Yamamoto in the 1990s, as a ""trustee"", although Sery died in January of that year.:Indeed, the group of principal employees of the Socrates Institute seems to be composed of retired professors who have (what sometimes appear to have been tangential) relationships to Yamamoto's academic past, or who are former postdocs or students of Yamamoto's from decades prior. According to tax filings, none of the members listed as directors or trustees of Socrates has ever received any compensation, and the majority of the institute's expenses appear to be publication fees.Perhaps the most enigmatic piece of information obtained through examining tax records is the inclusion of a man named Nobuyuki Yamamoto as a deputy director of the Socrates Institute between 2005 and 2007. Based on records we obtained in addition to the address listed on tax filings, Nobuyuki is Yamamoto's son. However, prior to our informing the senior Yamamoto of our possession of this information, he told us that Nobuyuki Yamamoto was not his son; then, when confronted with this evidence, Yamamoto then corrected himself.This reversal could be, perhaps, written off as a slip of the tongue, but it needs be mentioned that there is in fact another Nobuyuki Yamamoto who does cancer research and has a publishing history that is superficially similar to the work performed at Socrates. This other Nobuyuki Yamamoto is evidently unrelated to Nobuto Yamamoto (we reached out to the former and received no response), but his sharing a name with Nobuto Yamamoto's son serves, either intentionally or accidentally, to insert the work of the Socrates Institute into the same scientific literature searches as genuinely legitimate, but wholly unrelated, research.:The Nobuyuki affiliated with Socrates, who we presume is Nobuto's son based on our conversations with the latter, is listed as an author on a number of the 2008 and 2009 papers as well. The Nobuyuki Yamamoto at Socrates is not a medical researcher or a practicing scientist, however: Nobuyuki has a masters degree in marine microbiology, and now in his sixties, he works as an IT director at West Chester University.One could make that argument that none of these perhaps superficially minor discrepancies matters if Yamamoto's science holds up, a point that Yamamoto firmly, and to our ears sincerely, stands by. Such an argument, however, ignores the role that academic or professional research institutions have in ensuring that research that is conducted ethically and without bias. Because of his position outside of accredited physical institutions, Yamamoto seems to have developed a disregard for the foundations of the scientific process, most notably, the accurate representation of scientific participation and consensus.:That viewpoint is explicitly evident in the authorship of one of the papers that, despite the Anticancer Fund's best efforts, remains unretracted. That paper (""Immunotherapy for Prostate Cancer with Gc Protein-Derived Macrophage-Activating Factor, GcMAF""), published by Translational Oncology in 2008, lists Nobotu Yamamoto, his son Nobuyuki Yamamoto, and Hirofumi Suyama (a man who retired from active research in 1987) as authors. This seemingly false representation of consensus has ramifications far outside the scientific realm.4. THE FALLOUTEvidently convinced of both the potential of GcMAF and the legitimacy of the Socrates Institute, Yamamoto successfully sold his patents for GcMAF and related intellectual property to an Israeli biopharmaceutical company, Efranat Macrophage, in November 2009. An archived version of that company's web site from 2013 prominently shows Yamamoto as a ""co-founder"" and inventor of GcMAF. Now, however, all mention of Yamamoto has been removed from the site. Efranat is still working to find a use for GcMAF, but they have now rebranded it as a compound called ""EF-022"", changing the name of the chemical midway through a clinical trial. (Efranat did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this article.):Nobutu Yamamoto, center, with Efranat co-founders Boaz Shoham (left) and Avi Levin (right) from an archived version of that company's website as it appeared in 2013.Beginning in 2010, following the publication of the Socrates papers, a separate online entity unrelated to Efranat Macrophage appeared that gradually evolved into David Noakes' Immuno Biotech, a firm that produced and heavily promoted GcMAF (which cannot be legally marketed). ""One time our patent lawyer tried to sue Noakes in England but he escaped,"" Yamamoto said in a letter to the editor of Translational Oncology.Jeffrey Bradstreet was a controversial American doctor involved with Noakes' Immuno Biotech. Bradstreet, who had previously published a number of papers suggesting that GcMAF could ""cure"" children with autism, and his suicide following a raid on that company (and his own clinic) spawned the aforementioned conspiracy theories about the government's and Big Pharma's merciless goal to hide a cure for cancer. The raid on Immuno Biotech's production facility that preceded Bradstreet's death revealed that materials used in their production of their GcMAF (i.e., blood plasma) were explicitly labeled that they not be administered to humans or used in the production of drugs.Yet another group in Japan created and patented what they call ""second generation GcMAF,"" announcing the therapy in a misleading  in the journal Nature Outlooks that was formatted to look like a peer-reviewed study (and has been cited as such). This company still actively promotes and sells GcMAF products, according to their web site.:Aside from the safety issues created by the undervetted promotion of GcMAF by online profiteers, the viral promotion of conspiracy theories suggesting that sinister government or corporate entities are purposely keeping GcMAF from the public means that those who search online for cures for cancer, AIDS, or other ailments in the wake of terrifying diagnoses are likely to find information about GcMAF and led into believing in what is almost assuredly a false ray of hope. That ray of hope would be misleadingly supported by the appearance of legitimate-looking research presented by an institute run from a retired scientist's home: Although three of the papers from the Socrates Institute were retracted, PDF versions of them are still in wide circulation without noting their retractions, and other GcMAF papers are still part of the scientific literature.Translational Oncology, after receiving the same responses from Yamamoto that we were able to obtain, declined to retract Yamamoto's paper asserting that GcMAF may be a therapy for prostate cancer. The Socrates's Institute's 2006 paper on the utility of NaGalese as an indicator for AIDS, published in the journal AIDS Research & Human Retroviruses, remains in the record as well.:Legitimate questions remain to be asked of other papers that have been published without the knowledge of the people who are listed as their co-authors, as was the case with Sucha Asbell in 1996. That paper, and a number of others from Yamamoto's Einstein Medical Center years, are also still part of the scientific literature.One could argue Yamamoto's most evident transgressions were the desire to protect the intellectual property resulting from his work, and to be considered as a legitimate scientist when he was without an institution to support his efforts. Such an argument ignores the fallout created by proliferation and support of this kind of research, which gives false hope to patients, enables Internet hucksters, and leads to potential delays in more effective treatment.This proliferation of questionable research also masks the legitimate concern that Yamamoto's unyielding faith in his own work may cloud his responsibility to present it objectively. Dr. McKee, the man who left Yamamoto's lab for legal and ethical reasons, told us that GcMAF seemed to have some anticancer properties but ""it was not of the degree that Dr. Yamamoto believed it to be"". He also told us that he thought it could possibly be a useful medicine, but that it would need to be combined with other therapies. Dr. Yamamoto, he said, wanted it to be the cure for cancer.:Yamamoto, for his part, tells us that the Socrates Institute has a groundbreaking paper coming out soon, alleging that GcMAF can be a cure for ""all disease."" Let us hope that this time, the Internet and the scientific publishing system will be ready to put these forthcoming results into the context they require."

Rating:FalseAbout this rating ContextIn 2018, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla mentioned a pill that had been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration a few months prior that contained a digital sensor that could track whether or not the medicine had been taken. This product was approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Contrary to online rumors, this comment was completely unrelated to vaccines or the COVID-19 pandemic. :Snopes is still fighting an ""infodemic"" of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

In December 2021, a video supposedly showing Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla talking about microchips in the COVID-19 vaccine started to circulate on social media. A number of social media users posted this video with a copied and pasted piece of text that read: ""Pfizer CEO Bourla talking about the microchip that will be in medications. Sounds normal right?? Just a conspiracy theory?? #Pfizer #Vaccines."":This video was taken in 2018, years before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and has nothing to do with COVID-19 vaccines. This video was taken during the World Economic Forum in 2018. A guest asked the panel about how medical professionals could better engage with patients, noting that even if they made the best medicine that there was ""no guarantee that the patient was going to take the drug."" Bourla responded by saying that the FDA had recently approved a pill that contained a digital sensor which could track if the medicine had been ingested. Bourla said: ""Maybe I will use an example. I think it is fascinating what is happening in this field right now. The FDA approved the first electronic pill, if I can call it that, it's basically a biological chip that is in the tablet and once you take the table it sends a signal that you took the tablet. Imagine the implications of that compliance. The insurance companies can know that the medicines that patients should take they do take them. It is fascinating what happens in this field.""Bourla appears to be referring to Abilify MyCite, an aripiprazole tablet with a sensor that detects when a pill has been ingested that was approved by the FDA a few months before this video was taken.:Regarding the tablet, the FDA wrote in a release:The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved the first drug in the U.S. with a digital ingestion tracking system. Abilify MyCite (aripiprazole tablets with sensor) has an ingestible sensor embedded in the pill that records that the medication was taken. The product is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute treatment of manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and for use as an add-on treatment for depression in adults.The system works by sending a message from the pill's sensor to a wearable patch. The patch transmits the information to a mobile application so that patients can track the ingestion of the medication on their smart phone. Patients can also permit their caregivers and physician to access the information through a web-based portal.""Being able to track ingestion of medications prescribed for mental illness may be useful for some patients,"" said Mitchell Mathis, M.D., director of the Division of Psychiatry Products in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ""The FDA supports the development and use of new technology in prescription drugs and is committed to working with companies to understand how technology might benefit patients and prescribers."":Bourla was not talking about vaccines, he was not talking about COVID-19, and he was not talking about microchips. The CEO of Pfizer was talking about a new product that could help mental illness patients and caregivers track when medication had been ingested. The full exchange can be viewed below, starting at the 45:20 mark::This clip was widely shared on social media as if it contained some sort of ""gotcha"" moment proving that the conspiratorial notion that the vaccines contain microchips is real. If Bourla was talking about microchips in medicine in 2018, the flawed argument holds, then of course they're being added to the COVID-19 vaccines. There are a number of flaws in this argument. For starters, Bourla was not talking about ""microchips."" While ""microchip"" has become a bit of an all-encompassing term, it is generally used in conspiracy theory contexts to refer to a ""tracking device"" that has been secretly inserted into an unwilling individual. But that's not the case here. This sensor does not track a person's whereabouts or do anything other than send an alert to a phone that a medicine has been ingested.These conspiracy theories often hinge on notions of secrecy and underhanded plots, yet the evidence provided tends to point back to publicly available FDA news releases. In the video above, for example, Bourla is talking about a product that was approved by the FDA. The FDA has also issued releases regarding the COVID-19 vaccine, and none of those make any mention of microchips. You can read more about the ingredients in the COVID-19 vaccines in a previous article. :Furthermore, the fact that microchips and biosensors exist is not proof that they exist in  COVID-19 vaccine. In the video above, Bourla is simply discussing a recent development in the biosensor field. This is not evidence that biosensors are also in the COVID-19 vaccine and in the video above Bourla makes no such claim.  "
15,15,36.SandyHookParentsSueC,"The parents of two children murdered in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary school massacre have filed two separate defamation lawsuits against conspiracy-peddling troll Alex Jones and his InfoWars network.Neil Heslin, the father of 6-year-old Jesse Lewis, along with Leonard Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa, the parents of 6-year-old Noah Pozner, are both seeking damages in excess of $1,000,000 in a lawsuit filed on 16 April 2018 in Travis County District Court in Austin, Texas, where InfoWars is based.InfoWars has made it a mission to paint victims and survivors of the Sandy Hook massacre -- in which 20 young children and six adults were killed by a gunman -- as actors in a ""false flag"" attack. As a result, grieving loved ones have been relentlessly stalked, harassed and threatened by ""hoaxers"" who buy into these narratives, which are easily disprovable and wholly without merit.According to court documents, Jones and cohost Owen Shroyer have been smearing parents with rants and false commentary that weaves their tragedy into a delusional New World Order conspiracy theory, in which they claim that mass shootings are staged incidents created by a secret, all-powerful cabal in an effort to seize Americans' guns and establish an autocratic global government.:Bill Ogden, an attorney for the parents, told us:This case has absolutely nothing to do with the First Amendment. This case has to do with a media source that touts itself as seeking the truth but makes false claims about people. That's why we have defamation laws. When you point out specific people and call them liars, and say they didn't hold their dead children in their arms, there are consequences for that.An attorney for InfoWars did not respond to our request for comment.Both lawsuits claim that Jones and InfoWars targeted the parents for harassment by telling their viewers that they were liars engaged in a scheme to cover up a ""false flag,"" or a mass casualty event staged by the government as a pretext for ramped-up repression. InfoWars co-host Shroyer, for example, made an easily-debunked claim that Heslin had been dishonest during a June 2017 interview with NBC host Megyn Kelly when he said he had held his son's bullet-ridden body in his arms, because the victims of the shooting were identified using photographs.:But, obviously, the bodies were later released to families so that they could hold funerals for their loved ones, which the news media covered extensively. According to court documents:Shroyer's report was manifestly false. In addition, a minimal amount of research would have caused any competent journalist not to publish the defamatory accusation. According to contemporary news accounts, the bodies of the victims were released from the medical examiner into the custody of the families.Funerals where the children's bodies were in the custody of their parents were widely reported on by the press.Jones also claimed an interview De La Rosa did with CNN journalist Anderson Cooper was faked and done on a set, in an effort to label her a ""crisis actor"":Mr. Jones' assertion that Plaintiff Veronique De La Rosa participated in a faked blue-screen interview from a remote location is manifestly false. Mr. Jones' assertion that the interview did not take place in front of the Edmond Town Hall is also manifestly false. The visual effect described by Mr. Jones is the result of motion compensation video compression, which would have been readily ascertainable at the time Mr. Jones made his claims.Nonetheless, after five years, Mr. Jones continues to push this sick lie about Mrs. De La Rosa and her interview.:Of Heslin, Pozner and De La Rosa, Ogden told us:Sadly this has gone all the way up through death threats. So not only can these people not grieve in peace, they're now looking over their shoulders 24/7.Jones is also being sued by Marcel Fontaine, a 24-year-old Massachusetts man falsely accused by InfoWars of being the gunman in the 14 February 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where seventeen people were murdered. The InfoWars post claimed the shooter ""dressed like a communist"" and that the ""MSM"" -- conspiracy-speak for ""mainstream media"" were covering it up. The post has since been retracted but still contains a link to another bogus story alleging there was a second shooter in Parkland.Some who buy into the same conspiracy theory InfoWars traffics have been arrested for taking their conspiratorial thinking into the real world.:In 2015, hoaxer Matthew Mills of New York was arrested at an annual marathon held in honor of Sandy Hook teacher Vikki Soto for stalking and harassing Soto's sister.In 2017, Lucy Richards, a 57-year-old Florida woman, was sentenced to five months in prison for sending death threats to Pozner in which she said:Did you hide your imaginary son in the attic? Are you still fucking him? You fucking Jew bastard. Jew bastard. Look behind you. Death is coming to you real soon.In March 2018, Robert Ussery and Jodi Mann, hoaxers who go by the social media handles Side Thorn and Conspiracy Granny respectively, were arrested for trespassing after verbally assaulting the pastor of First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, whose 14-year-old daughter was among 26 people killed in the 5 November 2017 mass shooting there.In February 2018, three other conspiratorial web sites, GotNews, TheGatewayPundit.com and FreedomDaily.com were also hit with a defamation lawsuit after falsely accusing an innocent person of driving the car that ran down counter-protesters, killing a woman, at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in August 2017.:A Facebook page run Sandy Hook hoaxers has also been removed by Facebook; it is now being controlled by anti-hoaxers who asked to remain anonymous for security reasons."

And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. :In May 2020, as the drug Remdesivir was being explored as a potential treatment for the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, a widespread social media post posited a sprawling conspiracy involving U.S. biopharmaceutical company Gilead, China, the international medical organization Unitaid, George Soros, Bill Gates, the World Health Organization, Hillary Clinton, and National Institute of Allergy, and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci. The theory holds that together they were trying to suppress the supposedly highly effective drug Hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 in favor of Remdesivir::The disconnected statements offered in support of the conspiracy theory added up to nothing, but some of them individually had varying amounts of truth to them, which we briefly survey below.Some very preliminary research has suggested that Remdesivir, a drug originally developed to target Ebola, may show some promise as a treatment (not a ""cure"") for COVID-19.The patent for Remdesivir is held by Gilead Sciences, a California-based biopharmaceutical company.In January 2020, the Wuhan Institute of Virology of the China Academy of Sciences applied to patent the use of Remdesivir in China. Even if that application were granted, it would have very limited scope and would not mean that China would ""own"" the patent to Remdesivir:""Even if the Wuhan Institute's application gets authorized, the role is very limited because Gilead still owns the fundamental patent of the drug,"" said Zhao Youbin, a Shanghai-based intellectual property counsel at Purplevine IP Service Co. ""Any exploitation of the patent must seek approval from Gilead."":Unitaid is an international organization that invests in innovations to prevent, diagnose, and treat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria more quickly, affordably and effectively. Unitaid also works to improve access to diagnostics and treatment for HIV co-infections such as hepatitis C and human papillomavirus (HPV), and they have ""moved quickly to reshape its programs to contribute to the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic."" Unitaid is not ""Gilead's drug patent sharing subsidiary branch"" (or any other form subsidiary of Gilead), the organization told us, nor does Unitaid have an office near Wuhan, China. (Unitaid has a single office location in Geneva, Switzerland.):Unitaid's ""About Us"" website page notes that the organization ""is a hosted partnership of the World Health Organization"" (from whom they receive no financial support), and Unitaid's ""Investing in Unitaid"" page states that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is a main donor. Unitaid has no past or current links, financial or otherwise, with George Soros or Fauci, the organization told us via email.During the 2016 presidential campaign cycle, individuals associated with Gilead donated to Hillary Clinton's campaign (and to many other candidates from both parties). Nonetheless, during that campaign, Clinton asserted she would ""go after drug companies that charge exorbitant prices"" and singled out Gilead, ""whose hepatitis C drugs cost between $900 and $1,000 per pill in the United States."" In response to our query, Unitaid informed us that it did not provide financial or other support to the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential election campaign.Between 2014 and 2019, the EcoHealth Alliance was awarded a series of grants totaling approximately $3.7 million by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, of which Fauci is the director, to study the ""risk of future coronavirus (CoV) emergence from wildlife using in-depth field investigations across the human-wildlife interface in China."" Only a portion of this money has been used to fund research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, however.:The anti-malarial drug Hydroxychloroquine, much-touted by U.S. President Donald Trump as a potential COVID-19 treatment, does not have a proven ""92% success rate"" in treating patients with that disease. Rather, according to a ""finding from a retrospective analysis conducted by the U.S. Veterans Health Administration,"" hydroxychloroquine for treatment of patients with COVID-19, ""combined with or without azithromycin, not only may not help mitigate the virus' effect, it also may increase overall mortality."""
17,17,438.WasBarackObamaNamedi,"Claim:President Obama is being sued for ""inciting violence"" against police.Rating:OutdatedAbout this rating In June 2017, a lawsuit filed by a man named Larry Klayman against President Barack Obama, George Soros, Black Lives Matter, Hillary Clinton, the Nation of Islam, and several others for inciting violence against police officers was dismissed.In 2018, dubious ""news"" web sites such as Guerrilla.News continued to post about this lawsuit as if it was still recent, relevant, and ongoing::FEDERAL LAWSUIT Names Obama, Holder, Sharpton, Farrakhan, BLM Leaders for ""INCITING VIOLENCE"" Against PoliceIt seems as though Former President Barack Obama may have some regrets after supporting Black Lives Matter. He was so adamant about pushing the cop-hating and white-hating mentality that was the catalyst in further dividing Americans, but now it seems to all have backfired. A conservative activist is in the process of holding Obama and his black extremist peers responsible for the hate that they have built through their idiotic persistence.Former prosecutor Larry Klayman is sick and tired of the cop-killing and extreme animosity towards police. He recently filed a lawsuit against a group of defendants that he believes are responsible for instigating the hateful crime spree.This lawsuit was filed by Larry Klayman in July 2016 in the United States District Court of the Northern District of Texas on behalf of himself and Dallas Police Sargent Demetrick Pennie, shortly after five police officers were killed by a sniper. The lawsuit accused Obama and 16 other defendants of inciting ""their supporters and others to engage in threats of and attacks to cause serious bodily injury or death upon police officers and other law enforcement persons of all races and ethnicity including but not limited to Jews, Christians and Caucasians.""  It was dismissed in June 2017::With respect to Defendants President Obama and General Holder, the court grants their Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 21), as Plaintiffs lack Article III standing, and accordingly dismisses without prejudice Count Three for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). Counts One and Two are dismissed without prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(A)(i), as Plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed these claims against President Obama and General Holder, and no answer or motion for summary judgment has been filed by either Defendant.Klayman has a long history of filing frivolous lawsuits. In fact, during the back-and-fourth litigation of the aforementioned lawsuit, the court warned Klayman about filing more ""nonsensical documents"" and threatened him with a fine:ORDER: The record reflects Mr. Klayman's predilection for filing frivolous, nonsensical, and vituperative documents, in the form of notices, motions, briefs, etc., in response to unfavorable rulings. The court has grown weary of Mr. Klayman's tactics. If Mr. Klayman files any further frivolous or nonsensical documents in this matter, the court will personally sanction him monetarily. The court directs the Clerk to strike ""Plaintiffs' Response to the Court's Order Denying Motion for Leave to File Notice of New Case Authority Re: Memorandum Opinion and Order in Nwanguma v. Trump""(Doc. 132 ). (Ordered by Judge Sam A Lindsay on 4/13/2017) (axm) (Entered: 04/14/2017):It appears that Klayman escaped discipline during the course of these legal proceedings, but the conservative attorney has not always been so lucky. In a 2017 profile of the conservative attorney, TheHill.com noted that Klayman has been formally disciplined by multiple courts:In a 2016 opinion, a federal court of appeals noted 12 cases ""in which Klayman's ability to practice law in an ethical and orderly manner was called into question.""Klayman, an avid supporter of the ""birther"" conspiracy theory, also once filed a petition to get Obama deported. Klayman has also referred to Obama as a ""Muslim king"" and once held a ""citizen's grand jury"" (which had no legal authority) in an attempt to charge Obama with fraud for becoming president. The activist lawyer's documents have no force of law and compel no government action, serving instead as self-published expressions of his political viewpoint."
18,18,677.DoesBidenWantFraudul,"Claim:President-elect Joe Biden's campaign directed elections officials to consider ballots valid even if they are fake, manipulated, or cast by ineligible or deceased voters.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.In the aftermath of the 2020 U.S. presidential election, U.S. President Donald Trump and his team launched a massive misinformation campaign to try to convince Americans that his political opponents were running a grand conspiracy to undermine Trump's reelection. (Read more fact checks like this one here.):As part of that communication strategy, the Trump campaign alleged without evidence that Joe Biden -- who was projected the winner on Nov. 7 -- only secured the popular vote in key battleground states because polling workers there had counted all ballots, regardless of their legality. In several emails obtained by Snopes, the campaign alleged: ""The Biden campaign wants ballots counted even if they are fraudulent, manufactured, or cast by ineligible or deceased voters."":The claim was false. No evidence showed president-elect Biden, nor any other Democrat, was engaged in large-scale electoral fraud, nor that his campaign wanted ineligible ballots to count in the 2020 presidential election. Rather, Biden's campaign framed such claims by Trump as attempts to stop the democratic process.:Nonetheless, this baseless allegation by Trump appeared verbatim and in alternate forms across social media in the days after polls closed. Here, for example, we debunked one viral video that Trump and his supporters claimed showed Biden ""admitting"" to voter fraud, when, in reality, that wasn't the case.All states require voters to be U.S. citizens, over age 18, and meet certain residency requirements to legally vote. Additionally, eligible mail-in ballots must meet postmarking deadlines, which vary by state, and include signatures of voters.But local governments  -- not politicians in Washington, D.C., including Biden -- establish rules governing the process for counting votes. In fact, most state laws grant counties the authority to administer elections via a board of electors, an election official or officials, or both. As a result, thousands of local jurisdictions come together to run federal elections, including presidential races, and they all operate under their own rules governing vote counting. Many state laws allow mail-in ballots received after Election Day to be counted.For the alleged conspiracy to be true, Biden's team would have had to infiltrate a variety of election boards or jurisdictions, and direct their poll workers to count fake ballots or those completed by ineligible voters, despite state laws imposing severe punishments for that criminal activity. :However, according to top elections officials from both political parties in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Nevada, there were no widespread voting irregularities, nor any major instances of fraud or illegal activity in the 2020 presidential election, The Associated Press reported. Here's what's key: No elections expert doubts voter fraud exists in U.S. elections, including cases where people who aren't eligible to vote try to cast ballots. Typically, as reported by The Associated Press, the crime happens when people wanting to honor the wishes of loved ones who recently died illegally fill out ballots for the deceased. But all instances of voter fraud taken together are extremely minuscule in comparison to the number of ballots cast, and do not change the outcome of an election.In sum, since no evidence existed to show local elections were nefariously counting fraudulent ballots under directives from Biden, his campaign, or the Democratic Party in the 2020 presidential election, we rate this claim ""false."":"
19,19,700.OregonRefugeStandoff,"David Fry was the last of the remaining four occupiers of Oregon's Malheur Refuge to surrender peacefully to FBI agents Thursday morning, ending a standoff that has now stretched well into its second month.  Fry stayed on a livestream for several hours after the rest of his fellow occupiers had surrendered, threatening alternately to shoot himself and others before finally turning himself in.""It has never been the FBI's desire to engage these armed occupiers in any way other than through dialogue, and to that end, the FBI has negotiated with patience and restraint in an effort to resolve the situation peacefully,"" said Greg Bretzing, Oregon FBI Special Agent in Charge, in a statement:However, we reached a point where it became necessary to take action in a way that best ensured the safety of those on the refuge, the law enforcement officers who are on scene, and the people of Harney County who live and work in this area.The four who remained (Sean Anderson and his wife Sandy Anderson, David Fry, and Jeff Banta) said they had been camping out rather than stay in the federal building at the refuge. An bizarre, hours-long livestream from their campsite ended as a wide-ranging, conversation (peppered with conspiracy theories about everything from Common Core to Black Hawk helicopters) between the four and Nevada State Assemblywoman Michele Fiore, who seemed to be acting as a mediator.:The four were indicted in absentia, along with twelve who had already been arrested. They all face federal felony charges of conspiracy to impede officers, which broadly covers all the events and activities since they took over the refuge.Armed militia members, led by Ammon Bundy, entered the wildlife refuge on 2 January 2016, saying they were protesting federal government overreach. On 26 January, the standoff escalated into violence that ended with police shooting LaVoy Finicum, who was acting as the unofficial spokesman for the armed occupation.Cliven Bundy, the Nevada rancher (and father of Ammon Bundy) who gained notoriety in 2014 in his own armed standoff against the Bureau of Land Management over the federal government trying to push his cattle out of federally protected land, traveled to Oregon to support the occupiers. He was arrested at the Portland airport late Wednesday."
20,20,69.5GConspiracyTheories,"This article is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.As the coronavirus pandemic has gathered momentum, so too have explanations for how the outbreak started and what is causing its spread. Among these explanations is a theory that the recent rollout of 5G technology is to blame. Many countries are witnessing increased numbers of groups warning others about the dangers of 5G. In the UK, Australia and the US, activists believe that 5G is the real cause of the pandemic, and that disrupting the 5G network is necessary to halt the spread of the virus. At the extreme end of these groups are those who warn that COVID-19 is a hoax, a cover-story for more evil plans, of which 5G is a crucial part.Why do people believe conspiracy theories, and what accounts for the ongoing surge in their popularity? At the root of these beliefs is a contemporary spirit of distrust towards governments and health organisations. Moreover, people are particularly drawn to these alternative explanations during times of crisis.:Truth seekersMany conspiracy theorists identify themselves as ""truth seekers"". They are often part of a wider movement of people that consider themselves to be free thinkers who are courageous enough to seek the truth, and to speak up. They act like heroic detectives, revealing what they see as powerful groups operating in secrecy to achieve malevolent outcomes.Most conspiracy theories view these powerful groups as working in the shadows, inaccessible and behind the scenes. But the 5G-coronavirus theory departs from this template in one crucial way: the source of evil is visible and accessible to anyone who believes in these ideas.Unlike shadowy cabals and occult forces, the 5G-coronavirus conspiracy can be challenged directly. The 5G network is composed of material infrastructures that are easy to identify and access. For those who believe they know the truth, acts of vandalism against phone masts and antennas represent the possibility to exert some control over troubling events.:Conspiracies at a time of crisisPeople want to simplify and make sense of complex and unprecedented situations. As a means to understand this pandemic, there exist both official and conspiracy theories. The official truth is simple: COVID-19 was transferred to humans from animals, similar to previous coronavirus outbreaks. It is primarily spread through droplets generated when an infected person sneezes or coughs.The popularity of theories that link 5G to the outbreak, however, expose the levels of distrust towards scientific claims, truth and expert explanations of events. Although anti-5G theories have been around for some time, these explanations are currently winning new supporters. This is in part due to a lack of confidence in governments, many of which have struggled to manage this crisis, and now face questions as to whether they acted too early or too late.More concerning is how right-wing populism thrives in and intensifies this climate of distrust. All over the world, populist figures advance a polarising worldview that pits corrupt political, corporate and scientific elites against an enlightened community of ""common people"". Donald Trump, Matteo Salvini, Jair Bolsonaro and Nigel Farage garner support by framing their struggle as one of the good leader against bad institutions.:This worldview simultaneously undermines ""the establishment"", and legitimises conspiracy theorists' distrust. The implications of this are troubling. Distinctions between scientific truths and conspiracy theories have become blurred at the highest levels of government. Unproven solutions to control diseases are favoured over evidence-based interventions. Moreover, there is a growing resistance to vaccination in countries where political populism is on the rise. Policy interventions designed to solve problems are instead seen as part of the problem.An infodemicThese considerations become even more important at a time when lockdown measures have led to people spending increased time on social media. In part, the internet enables those previously on the fringes of popular opinion to find and communicate with like-minded others. And while confidence in traditional institutions wanes, any number of alternative explanations resonate among friends in online groups. :As people try to understand the pandemic and make sense of their changed lives, celebrity YouTube ""truth seekers"" are receiving unprecedented levels of attention. Although Facebook newsfeeds are littered with state-sanctioned public health advice, private groups are awash with bogus claims and misinformation that contradicts the official knowledge and political processes. The World Health Organization has declared this situation to be an ""infodemic"". Pressure is now mounting on social media companies to restrict the flow of misinformation. Yet, within the truth seeker community, attempts by Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp to intervene are interpreted as further evidence that powerful institutions and elites are conspiring to conceal the ""real truth"".Events such as the attacks on 5G masts offer a barometer to measure levels of trust in leadership and expertise. The challenge for governments and the media will be to demonstrate renewed levels of openness and solidarity to restore public trust, rather than fuelling this appetite for alternative truths.:Tim Hill, Lecturer in Marketing, University of Bath; Robin Canniford, Co-director Cluster For Organization, Society and Markets, University of Melbourne, and Stephen Murphy, Lecturer in Marketing, University of EssexThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

21,21,135.NoPfizerDoesNotOwnNe,"Claim:As of January and February 2022, Pfizer owned Neil Young's song catalog or held sway over him and dictated his views on COVID-19 vaccination.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In early 2022, folk-rock legend Neil Young found himself the target of a laughable conspiracy theory after he spoke out against COVID-19-related misinformation. On Jan. 24, Young wrote that he wanted his music removed from the streaming platform Spotify, unless the company ended its agreement to host Joe Rogan's podcast, which has on several occasions provided a forum for potentially harmful misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. In response, Spotify removed Young's back catalog from its library, rather than cutting ties with Rogan. :In the midst of that controversy, vaccine skeptics and COVID-19 conspiracy theorists shared a ludicrous conspiracy theory claiming that the pharmaceutical company Pfizer -- which produces a widely-used COVID-19 vaccine -- either owned the rights to Young's music catalog or, through a chain of connections, held sway over the rock star and influenced, or even ordered, his pro-vaccination stance. For example, some social media users posted a meme with the text, ""When you realize Neil Young's music catalogue is owned by Pfizer""::Others did not explicitly claim that Pfizer itself owned some or all of Young's catalog, but did suggest that the company held sway over him, by way of a series of connections, and that therefore Young's opposition to Rogan and his criticism of vaccine misinformation should be dismissed as the result of corruption and self-compromise, rather than a principled stance. On social media, a conspiracy theorist who uses the moniker An0maly outlined the theory in helpful detail, starting with the observation that in January 2021, Young reportedly sold half of his catalog to a U.K.-based investment fund called Hipgnosis, for around $150 million. An0maly continued:So, 50% to UK investment fund Hipgnosis. In October of 2021, Blackstone and Hipgnosis Song Management launched [a] ""$1 billion partnership to invest in songs, recorded music, music IP and royalties."" Interesting. Blackstone is ""an American alternative investment management company"" who, interestingly enough, in 2020 announced the appointment of ""Jeffrey B. Kindler, former chairman and CEO of Pfizer, as [a] senior adviser.""Now I don't know the answer to this, but did Neil Young independently make the decision to try and blackball Joe Rogan for questioning big pharma and the government narrative? Or was it a team decision with a multi-billion-dollar investment firm who also owns a big chunk of his music?:The first point to note here is that, even among those promulgating the Young-Pfizer theory, it is not seriously suggested that Pfizer itself -- which is, after all, a pharmaceutical company -- owns the rights to any of Young's music. That claim can be dismissed. Before assessing the logic behind the theory, and its coherence, it's worth briefly evaluating the accuracy of each of its components. First, it appears to be true that, in January 2021, Young sold half of his songs to Hipgnosis. In a news release, Hipgnosis wrote: ""...The Company has acquired 50% of Neil Young's worldwide copyright and income interests in his entire song catalogue comprising 1,180 songs.""Secondly, it is also true that in October 2021, Blackstone bought an ownership stake in Hipgnosis, as demonstrated in news releases published by both companies. Finally, it is also true that in August 2020, Blackstone hired Jeff Kindler as a senior advisor, and that Kindler used to be the chairman and CEO of Pfizer. :However, rather than having uncovered a web of corruption, those pushing the Young-Pfizer story were engaging in the classic conspiracy theorist's fallacy of finding whatever possible connection they can between two separate entities (in this case, Young and Pfizer) without first testing the logical or chronological basis of that putative link. In other words, ""connecting the dots"" by whatever means available, rather than uncovering an actual, organic conspiracy. Let's look at the sequence of events. Kindler left Pfizer in 2010 -- a full decade before he joined Blackstone, and before the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted Pfizer to develop a vaccine along with its German partner BioNTech.Blackstone is a publicly traded company, meaning it has a fiduciary duty to its shareholders, and Kindler, in turn, has a professional obligation to provide sound business and strategic advice to Blackstone. Aside from presenting no concrete evidence whatsoever, those pushing the Young-Pfizer conspiracy theory appear to be asking readers to believe, despite these circumstances, one of two explanations::That Kindler set aside his obligations to Blackstone and managed to persuade the company to engage in a billion-dollar investment venture with Hipgnosis, specifically so that they could acquire some influence over the licensing of Young's music and then leverage that against Rogan's vaccine skepticism on Spotify, for the benefit of Pfizer, a completely separate company, which Kindler had left a decade earlier; orThat access to half of Young's catalog was a ""happy accident"" of the Blackstone-Hipgnosis deal but that, with the connivance of Young himself, Kindler sought to leverage that access against Rogan and Spotify, all for the benefit of Pfizer, a completely separate company, which Kindler had left a decade earlier. As outlandish as these scenarios are, they are premised on even shakier assumptions: for example, that Kindler was even consulted on the Blackstone-Hipgnosis deal; or that if he was, he was in favor of it; and that Young has any remaining financial or commercial obligations to Hipgnosis and/or Blackstone after the sale of half his music -- after all, if that deal is already done, what is the supposed basis of Hipgnosis or Blackstone's putative leverage over Young?:It's not necessary to list, in excruciating detail, each of the known factual and logical flaws associated with the Young-Pfizer conspiracy theory. The claim that the pharmaceutical company ""owned Young's music catalog"" was patently false, and the theory of a fantastical web of corruption, with Kindler at its centre, was presented without any concrete evidence and, perhaps more importantly, made no sense whatsoever.

Rating:FalseAbout this rating In December 2021, a video was circulated on social media that supposedly showed a young child surreptitiously handing U.S. President Joe Biden what appears to be a vial of blood. The @projectpelosi Twitter account falsely claimed that Biden received this ""vial of fresh blood"" so that he could drink it on his way back to the White House.::This Twitter account has since been suspended. Copies of the ""fresh blood"" video have since been reposted by other accounts and occasionally turn up on YouTube: This is a doctored video spreading conspiratorial nonsense. :A segment of the QAnon conspiracy theory holds that there is a cabal of politicians who engage in so-called satanic behavior, such as drinking the blood of children. There is no evidence to support this conspiracy theory. In fact, the vast majority of such claims are based on demonstrably inaccurate and false information. We took a deeper look at the false claim that Democrats drink the blood of children previously.The above-displayed video, for example, is doctored. The child in this video is not actually holding a vial of blood. Someone digitally inserted a vial of blood into this video in order to spread the nonsensical rumor that Biden drinks blood.The original video was taken in July 2021 as Biden stepped off Air Force One at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport where he was greeted by Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and his family. While no blood vials were exchanged in the original unaltered footage, Biden does appear to hand something to Beshear's son.

23,23,18.ConspiracyTheoryAbou,"The 31 March 2019 murder of hip hop artist and community advocate Nipsey Hussle in Los Angeles has prompted some netizens to drudge up a baseless conspiracy theory about holistic doctor deaths and insinuate the rapper was assassinated as part of a wide-ranging cover-up plot sanctioned by the pharmaceutical, medical, and regulatory agencies.Grammy award-nominated rapper Hussle (born Ermias Joseph Asghedom) was shot and killed while standing outside Marathon Clothing, a business he co-owned in South L.A. Police arrested 29-year-old Eric Holder on suspicion of committing what they believed to be a murder motivated by a personal dispute. (Holder has pleaded not guilty.)Before his untimely death, the 33-year-old artist announced he was working on a documentary film about alternative health guru and traditional healer Alfredo Bowman, also known as Dr. Sebi, who died in 2016 from pneumonia while in custody of Honduran authorities after being arrested on money-laundering charges. Sebi was 82 at the time of his death.:Hussle's killing appears to be totally unrelated to his work on the documentary film about Dr. Sebi. At a 2 April 2019 press conference, Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said that Hussle and the suspect knew each other, and that ""we believe this to be a dispute between Mr. Hussle and Mr. Holder. I'm not going to go into the conversations but it appears to be a personal matter between the two of them in regards to a dispute, and I'll leave it at that.""Moore said the suspect approached Hussle, who was standing outside the clothing store with two other people, and exchanged words. He returned multiple times before opening fire, injuring the other persons while fatally wounding Hussle.Deaths of holistic doctors and anything tangentially related to them have become fodder for a wide-ranging conspiracy theory that contends a plot is afoot to silence them before their unconventional cures kneecap the pharmaceutical industry. Hussle's work on the documentary about Sebi thus served as a segue for the conspiracy-minded to link the two events without evidence:This isn't a coincidence! Nipsey Hussle was working on a documentary that will narrate Dr. Sebi's Trial in 1985. Dr. Sebi claimed that he could cure AIDS & was allegedly executed by way of U.S. Medical Corporations because his AIDS remedy would take away from their own profits. pic.twitter.com/rqrvaeSbAi-- Jared Sawyer Jr. (@JaredSawyerJr) April 1, 2019:As we reported in 2017, this conspiracy theory was largely the brainchild of Erin Elizabeth, who runs the holistic blog Health Nut News. Elizabeth began cataloguing holistic doctor deaths in 2015 and keeping a running tab on them. In the wake of Hussle's murder, Elizabeth updated her post about the holistic doctor deaths with the following statement:Note from Erin: I know many of you are here because Nipsey Hussle, may he rest in peace, was gunned down in broad daylight in Los Angeles at the age of 33. He was making a documentary, which he talked about a lot, about Dr. Sebi who is on our list. He also talked about our holistic doctor death series publicly. Months ago, I signed a contract with Entertainment One in Los Angeles to do a documentary series as well, on the doctors and it would feature Dr. Sebi. I vow that no matter what, this documentary will be made.But as we also reported in 2017, a list of deaths does not itself a conspiracy make. The vast majority of the deaths Elizabeth has chronicled are demonstrably unrelated to each other and have already been explained as accidents, homicides not tied to any medical conspiracy, and natural causes. Sebi, for example, was an elderly person already suffering from a serious medical condition (pneumonia) when he was incarcerated in Honduras, where conditions for prisoners are notoriously harsh.:Some conspiracy buffs even looped the 2002 death of another prominent artist, TLC vocalist Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes, into the conspiracy, claiming the connection was relevant because Lopes died in Honduras on her way to see Sebi. Lopes's death, however, was also unrelated to Sebi's or Hussle's.It's true, coincidentally, that Lopes was vacationing in Honduras and was a client of Sebi's, but foul play was not suspected in her death. Lopes was killed in an auto accident in which she was thrown from the vehicle she was driving after attempting to pass a car in her lane, swerving to avoid an oncoming truck, and subsequently crashing into two trees and rolling the vehicle several times, thereby suffering a massive head injury. Little mystery surrounds her death, as the accident was captured by a photographer who was riding in the car with her.Hussle was a renowned community activist who was known for his efforts to help improve the quality of life and invigorate the Crenshaw neighborhood in which he grew up, as Los Angeles Magazine stated:Apart from a career in music that included a slew of well-received mixtapes and collaborations with artists including Drake and Snoop Dogg, Hussle was considered a pillar of the Crenshaw community. He'd recently announced he was launching a STEM education center and co-working space called Vector 90 along with real estate Dave Gross, with whom he was also working on a residential complex on the site of the plaza where Marathon currently stands. Last year, he signed on as a community partner in District 8 City Councilman Marqueece Harris-Dawson's Destination Crenshaw project, a mile-long outdoor museum that will run along the Metro Crenshaw Line.:Hussle was praised by city leaders for his efforts, with L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti observing at a 2 April 2019 press conference that Hussle was a ""tireless advocate for the young people of this city and of this world, to lift them up with the possibility of not being imprisoned by where you come from or past mistakes, but the possibility of what comes in the future."""
24,24,121.NoObamaDidntTweetThi,"Claim:Former U.S. President Barack Obama wrote a tweet asking if anyone checked whether his successor, Donald Trump, was born in Russia.Rating:FalseAbout this rating A fake tweet mocked up to look like it was written by former U.S. President Barack Obama went viral, likely because if it were real, it would have represented quite a clap back.The image, posted on March 31, 2022, is a screenshot of what looks like Obama's verified Twitter account and a tweet that states, ""I think most Americans would agree that I'm a level-headed individual, not a man who's prone to indulging in conspiracy theories. I've certainly had a fair number directed at me. But has anyone checked to make sure Donald Trump doesn't have a Russian birth certificate?""::The fake tweet is a play on the ""birther"" conspiracy theory, of which Obama's successor, former U.S. President Donald Trump, was a major proponent before he took office. Birtherism is a racist conspiracy theory that falsely posits Obama, the first Black president, wasn't born in the U.S.The tweet also plays on news stories that took off after Trump took office, reporting the latter's campaign had received help from the Russian government. When Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Trump referred to Russian President Vladimir Putin's military strategy as ""genius.""The Obama tweet doesn't appear on his Twitter timeline, nor does it appear on PolitiWoops, a database of deleted tweets by political figures operated by the non-profit news organization ProPublica."

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.The ""anti-lockdown"" and #Reopen protests in the U.S. have powerful and secretive backers, but there are real Americans on the streets expressing their opinions. As an ethnographer - someone who studies cultural participation - I'm interested in who those Americans are, and why they're upset. I spent the last week in what you might call an online road trip, studying 30 posts of protest footage from events in 15 cities. I found some shared themes, which don't fit well with popular narratives about these protests.:   1. Poverty is taboo, but work is 'essential'Despite the economic toll the lockdowns are taking on America's poor, no protesters put their own poverty on display, such as posting signs asking for help.Instead, they held signs with more general language, like ""Poverty Kills,"" or expressed concerns like the restaurateur in Phoenix, Arizona, who told a passing videographer he was worried about his 121 ""suffering, devastated"" employees.Their messages made clear that they didn't want to ask for a handout or charity - but they were asking to be allowed to work. Protesters across many states asserted their work - or even all work - was ""essential.""In one video from an ""Operation Gridlock"" protest in Lansing, Michigan, where activists planned to block traffic, a protester filmed out the window of his car when he drove past a sign saying ""Give me work not money."" The protester himself called out in approval, ""Give me work not money, I hear that!"":A young man at an Olympia, Washington, event described work as a source not only of money but identity: ""I wanna go back to work! That pride that you feel every day when you go home from work? That's like nothing that can ... be taken.""Protest signs in Denver, Colorado, included the plaintive ""I want my career back"" and the entrepreneurial ""Dogs Need Groomers."" :Outside the Missouri Capitol on April 21, some protesters wore masks - though others didn't.AP Photo/Jeff Roberson2. The threat of the virus is seriousDespite alarming news reports that protesters were ignoring social distancing, many of the protesters observed safety guidelines. Photos showed at least some people wearing masks. A TikTok video recruiting participants for Michigan's Operation Gridlock encouraged protesters to be safe; drone footage shows that most participants at the state capitol stayed in their cars, away from other people.Protesters' signs didn't really downplay the threat of the virus, but rather compared it with potential harm from the lockdown. For instance, a sign in Denver was headed ""Trading Lives"" and featured a scale with virus deaths on one side, with unemployment, suicide and homelessness on the other.:   3. Anti-science displays are on the fringeThere were protesters at several rallies who wore anti-vaccination T-shirts and held signs suggesting they don't trust public health experts and scientists. But only one protest was dominated by that theme. At that one, on April 18 in Austin, Texas, hundreds of attendees chanted ""Fire Fauci!"" referring to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who has been a frequent public face of the federal government's efforts to fight the virus. That was also the rally where right-wing radio host Alex Jones, who runs a conspiracy-theory website, drove around in a truck egging on attendees' chants through a megaphone.At the other events, it appeared protesters had been expecting higher numbers of infections than actually happened. Rather than seeing that as evidence of the success of social distancing, they seemed to interpret this as saying the science was no longer valid. ""The models were wrong"" was on more than one sign, suggesting protesters had paid attention to the scientific models at first but had come to believe the disease's seriousness had been exaggerated.:   4. People want to fight the virus in familiar waysEven when protesters acknowledged the threat of the virus, few of them were calling for medical experts to provide the solution. I saw none of the demonstrators calling for more widespread testing, for instance. :When they did express concern, protest signs coupled it with a desire to fight the contagion. In Boise, Idaho, one sign read ""Freedom over Fear."" In Denver, one said ""Don't let your mask be your muzzle.""However, the protesters wanted to fight the virus in ways that were more familiar to them and, perhaps, more empowering: In Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, a giant green truck had ""Jesus is my vaccine"" scrawled on its side. Some protesters demanded governments allow people to make their own decisions, and even displayed the pro-choice slogan ""My Body My Choice."" Others showed up with guns. One man in Frankfort, Kentucky, blew a shofar, a Jewish religious instrument made from a ram's horn blown at the start of a battle.:Armed protesters were among the crowd in Michigan on April 30.Jeff Kowalsky/AFP via Getty Images   5. 'Tyranny' depends on who governs, not howIn many of the events across different states, protesters objected to what they called ""tyranny,"" and held up the Revolution-era ""Don't Tread On Me"" Gadsden flag to symbolize their resistance to government rules. They were not objecting to President Donald Trump's April 13 declaration that, as president, his ""authority is total"" over the nation.Instead they were objecting to governors' lockdown rules, which they highlighted as overreaching their power. Many protesters likened the government's behavior to Nazis, with protesters adding ""Heil"" before Democratic governors' names.No male governor was targeted as viciously and overtly as female Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. A widely circulated poster depicted her dressed as Adolf Hitler, giving a Nazi salute beside a swastika. Other demonstrators talked about Whitmer as though she were mothering them instead of governing them, like one who insisted, ""We're not her children!"":   6. Race is a factorOne clearly visible theme in the #Reopen protests is how white the attendees are - but not just in terms of their own race. Their compassion also seemed limited to fellow white people. None that I saw were calling attention to the fact that the coronavirus doesn't hit all populations equally: Blacks and other racial minorities had less access to high-quality health care before the outbreak, and as a result are less healthy and less able to fight off the virus when it strikes.:There was overt racism toward the Chinese, too, echoing words of the president and other political leaders, as on the Jefferson City, Missouri, sign that read ""Tyranny is spreading faster than the China virus.""    :7. Divided and distanced, is it a movement?Most protesters did not refer to these protests as a movement. I found just one video offering a vision that they could form one. In that livestream from Operation Gridlock, at one point the videographer shouted, ""'merica!"" Then, his unseen companion replied in a meditative tone about the potential he saw on that road: ""Together we're strong, divided we're weak. That's the establishment's biggest fear, for the people to get together and not be divided. ... That's what they fear the most. Because we have the power."" It was not clear if those people with the power included the much greater number of people across America who were sheltered in place.Diana Daly, Assistant Professor of Information, University of ArizonaThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

26,26,674.DidaBillPassThatLets,"Claim:A U.S. law allows children as young as 11 to get vaccinated without their parents' consent.Rating:Mostly FalseAbout this rating What's TrueThe D.C. Council passed a law specific to Washington, D.C., in late December 2020 that allows children as young as 11 to receive vaccines if they are deemed capable by a doctor of giving informed consent.What's FalseNo nationwide U.S. law allows children as young as 11 to get vaccinated without the consent of their parents, although some states allow minors to get some vaccines if their parents are opposed.:In late December 2020, readers asked Snopes for verification of online rumors stating that a law went into effect recently allowing children to get vaccinated without the consent of their parents.Some of the posts shared screenshots from a website, Conservative Brief, which misleadingly included a picture of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. Fauci has been at the forefront of the U.S. response to the COVID-19 pandemic.:The meme led some readers to believe that a new nationwide law allows children 11 and older to get vaccinated without their parents' knowledge or consent. One reader inquired, ""Did The US just pass legislation that children can get the Covid vaccine without parental consent?""The answer is no.One such law did pass at the local level, in Washington, D.C., but had nothing to do with Fauci. According to the website for the D.C. Council, the law went into effect on Dec. 23, 2020.It allows children as young as 11 in Washington, D.C., to get vaccines against a range of illnesses like polio, measles, mumps and rubella, as well as the COVID-19 coronavirus and human papillomavirus, if a doctor determines they are capable of giving informed consent. The vaccination record would be sent to the child's school, not to their parents, if the parents are using a religious exemption that allows their child to attend school without vaccines against communicable diseases.The bill was originally introduced to the D.C. Council in early 2019 in response to an outbreak of measles. The intent was to circumvent parents who subscribe to anti-vaccine conspiracy theories and refuse to vaccinate their children, enabling such outbreaks.:Some of these children, like Ethan Lindenberger, have gotten themselves vaccinated against their parents' wishes and become public health advocates, and some states let teens get vaccines without parental consent.In the face of the anti-vaccine conspiracy movement, some advocate for expanding the practice of letting children of a certain age decide for themselves whether to get vaccinated without their parents' knowledge. However, no nationwide law exists that allows children as young as 11 to receive a vaccine without parental consent."
27,27,243.ChildhoodVaccination,"Claim:   Studies have shown that children who are vaccinated are 85% more likely to inject heroin than those who are not. FALSEExample: [Collected via Facebook, March 2015] Origins:   In July 2013, the Something Awful humor web site'sPhotoshop Phriday section (a showcase for ""the tremendous image manipulation talents of the Something Awful Forum Goons"") entreated participants to create fictitious advertising posters in furtherance of that week's theme of ""Anti-Vaccine Ads and Anti-Anti-Vaccine Ads!"":  We all have one of ""those"" friends who is always posting conspiracy theory and anti-vaccination pictures or articles on Facebook. I usually read them for a laugh and follow their citations which usually lead to another part of the same site.If they can take anti-vaccination posters to this level of absurdity, imagine what we can do!: One of the fake s created for that amusement was intended to skewer the anti-vaccination movement by asserting that ""children who are vaccinated are 85% more likely to inject heroin than those who are not"" because""vaccinations leave a lasting psychological belief that injecting is beneficial,"" but the image quickly began spreading across the internet removed from its original context.  The mistaken propagation of this faux ad as something containing valid information was heightened when the group Feminists Against Vaccinations posted it to their Facebook page on 8 March 2015.  Despite the fact that the image still contained a watermark from SomethingAwful.com and the 1-800 number listed at the bottom of the ad was a few digits short of authenticity, many viewers believed that the posted illustrated a scarily real statistic linking heroin use to childhood vaccinations. But according to Sunshine Coast Local Medical Association president Dr Di Minuskin, this viral meme is ""outrageously incorrect"":""I am horrified that this type of message should gain any validity,"" Dr Minuskin said. ""If anyone receives this image via social media I would recommend they swiftly assign it to the trash box where it belongs. Not only is the information outrageously incorrect, it is irresponsible to be creating unwarranted fear about such an important issue."": Last updated:   23 March 2015"
28,28,578.HowHolocaustDenialWo,"The Holocaust happened.It is a fact that some six million European Jews were systematically murdered by Nazi Germany and its collaborators between 1941 and 1945 in a state-sponsored program of genocide.The National Socialists came to power in part by convincing Germans that many of the country's problems were caused by its Jewish minority, whom they labeled an ""inferior race"" and depicted as depraved and animal-like in anti-Semitic propaganda. Their implementation of a plan to exterminate the Jews -- the ""Final Solution,"" they called it -- has been well documented, starting with the 3,000 tons of confiscated Third Reich paperwork presented in evidence at the Nuremberg trials immediately after the war.Yet, despite universal agreement among historians about all of the above (""No serious historian questions that the Holocaust took place,"" the American Historical Association affirmed in a 1991 statement), there exists a tiny but vocal group of naysayers -- conspiracy theorists, actually, given that they claim that ""Jewish-controlled"" academic and media institutions ""invented"" the Holocaust -- whose mission it is to sow doubt that the genocide of European Jews ever happened. They are known (to everyone but themselves) as Holocaust deniers.:Here are some basic tenets of Holocaust denialism (via the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum):""Holocaust denial"" describes attempts to negate the established facts of the Nazi genocide of European Jewry. Common denial assertions are: that the murder of six million Jews during World War II never occurred; that the Nazis had no official policy or intention to exterminate the Jews; and that the poison gas chambers in Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp never existed.A newer trend is the distortion of the facts of the Holocaust. Common distortions include, for example, assertions that: the figure of six million Jewish deaths is an exaggeration; deaths in the concentration camps were the results of disease or starvation but not policy; and that the diary of Anne Frank is a forgery.The deniers aren't known for their subtlety. ""I don't see any reason to be tasteful about Auschwitz,"" said author, anti-Semite, and Holocaust denier David Irving in 1991. He continued:It's baloney, it's a legend. Once we admit the fact that it was a brutal slave labor camp and large numbers of people did die, as large numbers of innocent people died elsewhere in the War, why believe the rest of the baloney?I say quite tastelessly, in fact, that more women died on the back seat of Edward Kennedy's car at Chappaquiddick than ever died in a gas chamber in Auschwitz.:At a 2006 conference of Holocaust deniers in Iran hosted by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the country's former interior minister said, without irony, ""All the studies and research carried out so far have proven that there is no reason to believe that the Holocaust ever occurred and that it is only a tale.""Others at the conference admitted the killings took place, but claimed the numbers were inflated: Frederick Toben, an Australian who in 1999 served jail time in Germany for his Holocaust views, told the conference in no uncertain terms that the number of Jews killed in Nazi death camps -- an estimated 6 million -- is a myth.''The number of victims at the Auschwitz concentration camp could be about 2,007,'' Toben said. ''The railroad to the camp did not have enough capacity to transfer large numbers of Jews.""Don't mistake these for sincere historical quibbles. They are direct misstatements of the evidentiary record -- a record whose existence, again, we owe in large part to the Nazis themselves.:""Extermination, we're doing it""Both propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and SS chief Heinrich Himmler, for example, admitted there was an official plan to exterminate the Jewish population. ""The Jews have deserved the catastrophe that has now overtaken them,"" Goebbels wrote in his diary in 1942. ""Not much will remain of the Jews. On the whole it can be said that about 60 percent of them will have to be liquidated whereas only 40 percent can be used for forced labor.""Chillingly, Himmler said this in a 1943 speech in Posen, Poland:I refer now to the evacuation of the Jews, the extermination of the Jewish people. This is one of those things that is easily said: ""the Jewish people are being exterminated,"" says every Party member, ""quite true, it's part of our plans, the elimination of the Jews, extermination, we're doing it.""No one left behind a ledger sheet tallying the precise number of Jews ""exterminated"" but that doesn't mean the figure can't be accurately estimated based on existing evidence such as census reports and other government records that survived Nazi efforts to destroy them at the end of the war::No personnel were available or inclined to count Jewish deaths until the very end of World War II and the Nazi regime. Hence, total estimates are calculated only after the end of the war and are based on demographic loss data and the documents of the perpetrators. Though fragmentary, these sources provide essential figures from which to make calculations. Rooted in anti-SemitismSome Holocaust deniers are self-styled ""historical revisionists"" -- meaning they present themselves as earnest re-interpreters of real historical data whose goal is simply to reveal the whole truth -- but it's a misnomer. Scratch the surface of your typical Holocaust denier and you will find an anti-Semite. The notion, widespread among deniers, that Jews ""invented"" or ""exaggerated"" the Holocaust to further their own interests hearkens back to a centuries-old conspiracy theory positing a secret ""cabal"" of wealthy Jewish bankers seeking absolute world domination.""The Holocaust is the device used as the pillar of Zionist imperialism, Zionist aggression, Zionist terror and Zionist murder,"" former Ku Klux Klan Imperial Wizard David Duke has said (while dismissing the claim that the Nazis used gas chambers to kill Jews as a ""myth"").:In 2013, England's most infamous Holocaust denier, David Irving (quoted above saying more people died in Ted Kennedy's car than at Auschwitz), was asked if it weren't true that Jews ""run the world"":Irving, who strongly denies being anti-semitic, replies: ""Well sometimes people stand up and fight back.""He says Jews in America control all media, banks and that ""they dare not appoint any leading person in the White House to ministerial positions involving money without him being a Jew. Look where that got them in Germany in 1933. And they will not learn the lesson, they all think it won't happen again.""Then they ask why they are so hated.""...Irving says he hears people say Jews are hated because they crucified Jesus Christ. ""I say if you walk into a pub in Wapping and ask people why they don't like the Jews they don't mention Jesus. They mention other reasons. They're worried about their mortgages and the banks ... that's the reason why the Jews get hated."":It's telling that Irving denies hating Jews while repeatedly observing that ""Jews are hated,"" then blames them for it.The rise of ""soft denialism""There is a relatively new form of Holocaust denialism -- dubbed ""soft denialism"" because its adherents don't deny the Holocaust outright but attempt to trivialize it instead -- whose rise seems to have followed the same curve as that of right-wing nationalist movements worldwide in recent years.The most prevalent form of soft denialism revolves around the claim that the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany is given preferential treatment over the persecution of other minority groups by the same regime. But this is a moral deflection. It's a fact that the Reich persecuted and killed millions of others in the name of ""Aryan superiority"" -- Roma (""gypsies""), Serbs, Poles, individuals with disabilities, individuals perceived as ""homosexual,"" socialists, communists, and Jehovah's Witnesses, to name only some of the targeted minorities -- but this is no justification for eliding Hitler's decades-long vendetta against the Jewish people in particular, a vendetta which very nearly ended in their complete eradication. :In January 2017, President Trump was roundly criticized for issuing a statement ""in the name of the perished"" on Holocaust Remembrance Day, held on the anniversary of the 1945 liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, that never once mentioned the Jewish victims of that tragedy:January 27, 2017Statement by the President on International Holocaust Remembrance Day""It is with a heavy heart and somber mind that we remember and honor the victims, survivors, heroes of the Holocaust. It is impossible to fully fathom the depravity and horror inflicted on innocent people by Nazi terror.""Yet, we know that in the darkest hours of humanity, light shines the brightest. As we remember those who died, we are deeply grateful to those who risked their lives to save the innocent.""In the name of the perished, I pledge to do everything in my power throughout my Presidency, and my life, to ensure that the forces of evil never again defeat the powers of good. Together, we will make love and tolerance prevalent throughout the world."":Harsh reactions to Trump's statement came from many quarters.""This is not a political issue, this is a matter of not just sensitivity, it's a matter of historical fact,"" said Jonathan Greenblatt of the Anti-Defamation League. ""Six million Jews were slaughtered along with millions of other people. But the Holocaust was about this singular focus on the annihilation of the Jewish people. That's why we remember it. That's why there is a day, a sad day like this past Friday, to reflect upon it.""""The Nazis killed an astonishing number of people in monstrous ways and targeted certain groups -- Gypsies, the mentally challenged, and open homosexuals, among others,"" wrote conservative commentator John Podhoretz. ""But the Final Solution was aimed solely at the Jews. The Holocaust was about the Jews. ... To universalize it to 'all those who suffered' is to scrub the Holocaust of its meaning.""""The lack of a direct statement about the suffering of the Jewish people during the Holocaust was an unfortunate omission,"" said Fred Brown, a spokesperson for the Republican Jewish Coalition. ""History unambiguously shows the purpose of the Nazi's final solution was the extermination of the Jews of Europe. We hope, going forward, he conveys those feelings when speaking about the Holocaust."":The White House dismissed the criticisms, claiming they simply didn't want to leave any of the victims out. ""Despite what the media reports, we are an incredibly inclusive group and we took into account all of those who suffered,"" said spokesperson Hope Hicks.If the Trump administration won't listen to their critics, they ought to at least take note of who applauded them for their Holocaust statement -- the openly anti-Semitic ""alt-right"" leader Richard Spencer, for one, who hailed what he termed President Trump's ""de-Judification of the Holocaust"" in a blog post titled ""Because Hitler."" ""[T]he kvetching came quickly"" (yes, he used the Yiddish word) after Trump's statement was released, noted Spencer, and he was having none of it: Trump's statement on Holocaust Memorial Day is, on the surface, utterly defensible within the current moral paradigm: Hitler is depicted as quintessential evil, with modern society revolving around this dark center. But when viewed from the perspective of Jewish activists, Trump's statement becomes outrageous, as it dethrones Jews from a special position in the universe.:It seems unlikely that ""dethroning Jews"" was precisely what the Trump administration had in mind when they said their intent was ""inclusiveness."" That President Trump's Holocaust statement elicited such a response from an avowed white supremacist ought to give him pause before it comes time to issue the next one. Update: Trump's 2018 Holocaust Remembrance Day statement quite explicitly memorialized the millions of Jews who were persecuted and murdered by the Nazis. ""We have a responsibility to convey the lessons of the Holocaust to future generations,"" he added, ""and together as Americans, we have a moral obligation to combat antisemitism, confront hate, and prevent genocide. We must ensure that the history of the Holocaust remains forever relevant and that no people suffer these tragedies ever again."""
29,29,232.WaronChristmas,"Substituting ""Merry Christmas"" with ""Happy Holidays"" in a public context: Is it inclusive or exclusive? Whether it was a xenophobic or anti-Semitic conspiracy theory or a kitchen-table debate, the topic has been going around for so many decades that it is unclear who, if anyone, is actually waging the ""war"" for or against Christmas anymore.But if anyone was going to win this war, it's probably retailers.The National Retail Federation reports that consumer spending on gifts, food, decorations, and other holiday items has been trending upward for several years. And the National Christmas Tree Association reported a 20% increase in real tree purchases in 2018 compared to 2017. Fake tree purchases went up too. Meanwhile, some reports signaled a drop in Americans' charitable giving in 2018.So business built around Christmas doesn't appear wounded. But what of its spirit?:Pew Research Center reported that 9 in 10 Americans say they celebrate Christmas, though less than half celebrate it as a religious holiday (Millennials were least likely). And according to another Pew survey, the percentage of Americans who identify as Christian has trended downward, while ""those who describe their religious identity as atheist, agnostic or 'nothing in particular'"" has risen.And all the while, Mariah Carey's ""All I Want For Christmas Is You"" is the top holiday song year after year on Spotify.Is Christmas something said, something given, or something felt?If more people enjoy Christmas, but not the Nativity, is traditional Christmas threatened?

30,30,111.WasKetanjiBrownJacks,"Claim:Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who underwent Senate-confirmation hearings as a nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court in March 2022, presided over the ""Pizzagate"" case, in which a shooter targeted a pizzeria in Washington, D.C., in 2016.Rating:TrueAbout this rating Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court, presided over the controversial ""Pizzagate"" case in 2017. Since her Senate confirmation hearings in late March 2022, many online have been unearthing her past decisions to scrutinize her career.:""Pizzagate"" was a bizarre conspiracy theory that arose in 2016. It claimed Hillary Clinton and her former campaign chairman, John Podesta, ran a child sex ring in the basement of the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria in Washington, D. C. The theory grew on social media, promoted by Trump supporters and white supremacists, and resulted in a man walking into Comet Ping Pong with a rifle and firing numerous shots in December 2016.No one was injured or killed, but Edgar Maddison Welch, the shooter, pleaded guilty in March 2017 to federal charges of assault with a dangerous weapon and transporting a firearm over state lines.U.S. District Judge Jackson was presiding over the case at the time, and said that Welch's actions had ""literally left psychological wreckage."" She declared that ""the extent of the recklessness in this case is breathtaking."" He was sentenced to four years in prison.During Jackson's confirmation hearings, Republicans drew attention to her past sentencing of sex offenders who distributed images of child sex abuse, repeatedly implying that she had been too lenient.

Here's a video to debunk that: pic.twitter.com/hJsMNSdAsF-- Joey (@_Joey_Wong) February 21, 2018Hogg had visited California in 2017 and witnessed an altercation, about which he made a video blog -- a simple fact that was blown out by conspiracy theorists to mean he already lived in Los Angeles and was part of the entertainment industry. (Hogg did live in California, but relocated with his family to Florida before starting high school; he returns to visit every year, as many people do.) :Nikolas Cruz, 19, a former Marjory Stone Douglas student who used an AR-15 semi-automatic firearm he had reportedly purchased from a gun store to carry out the mass shooting, has since been charged with murder; Parkland students have galvanized a national movement calling for stricter gun legislation. Hogg has been one of the most vocal leaders in what has become known as the ""March For Our Lives.""The students' activism has made them the target of ""hoaxers"" -- deranged Internet users and grifters who spread false information that mass shooting incidents are manufactured by the government to seize guns and hand power to a secret global cabal working to install an authoritarian world government.Such hoaxers have periodically been arrested and jailed for physically stalking and harassing survivors, but despite their outlandish beliefs and apparent moral debasement, they are not exactly the ""fringe."" Far-right web sites and Internet personalities like GatewayPundit.com writer Lucian Wintrich, undeterred by ongoing lawsuits related to previous conspiracy theory-related blunders, have claimed the Parkland students were reading from scripts, while the National Rifle Association said in an official statement in response to a nationwide march on 24 March 2018 that the events were staged by ""Hollywood elites."":"
32,32,616.NotheOwnerofWTCBuild,"Claim:The owner of World Trade Center's building 7 ""admitted"" it wasn't brought down by the 9/11 terrorist attack but rather by a controlled demolition. Rating:FalseAbout this rating OriginMore than two decades after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, conspiracy theories about them remain prevalent.:Believers in 9/11 conspiracy theories generally assert the attack that took thousands of lives was not an act of terrorism but rather the work of a cabal of secret global elites, or an inside job perpetrated by the U.S. government.One key element of the conspiracy theories is the seemingly unexpected collapse of building 7, which unlike the Twin Towers, wasn't struck by jetliners::The tragedy that unfolded that day had a dramatic impact on the country. Beyond the near-term shock and emotional trauma inflicted by the attack, it was an inflection point leading to controversial domestic anti-terrorism policies, an era of anti-Muslim hate crimes and bigotry, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- the latter being the longest in U.S. history.Another effect was fueled by ""Loose Change,"" a 2005 viral video that also became fodder for a new era of internet conspiracy theorists. The video promotes the false claim that the towers collapsed as the result of a controlled demolition, as opposed to structural failures resulting from the fires started by jet fuel.That's where the misrepresentation of Larry Silverstein's comments come in.Silverstein was interviewed for the PBS documentary ""America Rebuilds."" But he never said, let alone ""admitted,"" that he had ordered building 7 demolished. He said::I remember getting a call from the fire department commander, telling me that they were not sure they were gonna be able to contain the fire, and I said, ""We've had such terrible loss of life, maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it."" And they made that decision to pull and we watched the building collapse.As the BBC reported, citing misinterpretation of his words, a spokesperson for Silverstein issued a follow-up statement clarifying that by using the phrase ""pull it,"" he was not referencing the building itself but the crew of firefighters inside the building:In the afternoon of September 11, Mr Silverstein spoke to the Fire Department Commander on site at Seven World Trade Centre.The Commander told Mr Silverstein that there were several fire fighters in the building working to contain the fires.Mr Silverstein expressed his view that the most important thing was to protect the safety of those fire fighters, including, if necessary, to have them withdraw from the building.Later in the day, the Fire Commander ordered his fire fighters out of the building and at 5:20pm the building collapsed. No lives were lost at 7 World Trade Centre on September 11, 2001.:In sum, Silverstein never said he had ordered the building demolished. Instead, conspiracy theorists twisted his vague wording in the documentary interview to suit their own agenda. Silverstein later stated that his comments had been mischaracterized and clarified that what he meant by ""pull it"" was the crew of firefighters inside the building, not the building itself.The National Institute of Standards and Technology's investigation concluded that building 7's collapse wasn't caused by a controlled demolition. Debris from the collapsed North Tower started a fire in the building. The fire sprinkler system in the lower floors had failed, allowing the fire to burn out of control, which eventually caused steel support elements to thermally expand. This led to a chain of structural failures that caused the building's collapse."

The story, posted by a blogger who uses the nom de plume Sorcha Faal, claimed the transfer was exposed by a report circulating in the Kremlin::An intriguing Ministry of Finance (MoF) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that elite Western bankers were ""stunned/bewildered"" a few hours ago after the Bank For International Settlements (BIS) registered a $1.8 billion transfer from the Clinton Foundation (CF) to the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) through the ""facilitation/abetment"" of JP Morgan Chase & Company (JPM) -- and for reasons yet to be firmly established. According to this report, the Bank for International Settlements is the world's oldest international financial organization and acts as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial transactions; the Qatar Central Bank is the bank of that Gulf State nations government and their ""bank of banks""; JP Morgan Chase & Company is the United States largest ""megabank""; and the Clinton Foundation is an international criminal money laundering organization whose clients include the Russian mafia.The article linked to a number of news sites and blogs but conveniently failed to link to the alleged Kremlin report that would support its main claim. The lack of proof that such a financial transfer was made hasn't stopped other unscrupulous web sites, such MegynKelly.org (which despite using her name doesn't have anything to do with the Fox News journalist Megyn Kelly) and Liberty Alliance from posting the story as though it were a legitimate news item. :RationalWiki describes Sorcha Faal's blog as an ""eyesore"" that is taken seriously only by its conspiracy theorist audience, and even then only marginally:Sorcha Faal is the alleged author of an ongoing series of ""reports"" published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don't think much of it.Each report resembles a news story in its style but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don't contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish.As we have noted in the past, Sorcha Faal is a notorious poster of false information, but the Internet being what it is, such information gets picked up and spread by unwary readers. Previous yarns created by Faal contain headlines such as ""Russia Names Hillary Clinton as 'Murder Suspect' in Death of Top UFO Researchers."" :"
34,34,254.IsChristineBlaseyFor,"Claim:Christine Blasey Ford is closely linked to the CIA, and her sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh are part of a CIA plot.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Dr. Christine Blasey Ford faced a torrent of personal attacks and conspiracy theories in September and October 2018, after she publicly accused federal judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, of sexually assaulting her when they were both high school students in Maryland in the early 1980s.:In late September 2018, a conspiracy theory emerged holding that Blasey Ford was closely linked to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and that her allegations were false and part of a CIA plot to block Kavanaugh's confirmation and disrupt President Trump's agenda.One meme which spread the conspiracy-mongering read as follows:If you believe this woman's story, consider this ...Her grandfather, Nicholas Deak, was a well known CIA agent for decades.Her father Ralph Blasey II ran three CIA-front companies Red Coats Inc., Datawatch, and Admiral Security Systems.And her brother Ralph Blasey II [sic] once worked for the law firm Baker Hostetler which was behind the creation of Fusion GPS and subsequently the dossier used to start the Russian collusion investigation.Get the picture?::Another meme emerged from a tweet and blog post published by conservative radio host Michael Savage on 27 September 2018:WHO IS DR BLASEY FORD?WELL, BESIDES BEING A ""PROFESSOR"" AT THE OFF BRAND UNIVERSITY, SHE ALSO WORKS AT A MAJOR UNIVERSITY DOWN THE STREET FROM PALO ALTO.

FORD DEEPLY TIED TO THE CIA? pic.twitter.com/QcRLchqGGn-- Michael Savage (@ASavageNation) September 27, 2018 The theory that Blasey Ford, in making her allegations against Kavanaugh, is acting on behalf of the CIA or as part of a CIA plot against him has three basic components:Christine Blasey Ford directs Stanford University's CIA undergraduate internship program.Her brother, Ralph Blasey III, once worked for a law firm which shares a building with three CIA-operated companies.Blasey Ford's grandfather was Nicholas Deak, a CIA-linked currency trader and former U.S. intelligence agent.:This theory, and its component strands, were written about and promoted on several non-mainstream web sites during September 2018, including What Does It Mean, the BrassBalls blog, ZeroHedge, Before It's News, and in a segment on Alex Jones' InfoWars show (in which Jones claimed Blasey Ford and her family were part of the ""leftist arm of the CIA,"" whose function is ""to create transgender children,"" among other pronouncements).On 17 September, WhatDoesItMean.com's ""Sorcha Faal"" outlined this somewhat complicated web of claims:An intriguing in-depth new Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today states that a Stanford University Psychiatry Professor named Dr. Christine Blasey has become the latest centerpiece of a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) plot to harm President Trump with her last-minute allegation, just days prior to US Senate confirmation, that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had attempted to sexually assault her over 30 years ago when they were teenage school children -- while being kept from the American people about Dr. Blasey is that she currently oversees the CIA Undergraduate Internship Program Stanford University developed by the notorious CIA-connected Stanford University Psychiatric Professor Dr. Frederick T. Melges -- who himself, in 1985, took into his care the homeless woman Lois Lang who assassinated CIA paymaster Nick Deak -- and that afterwards saw the CIA's black operations monies being controlled by Ralph G. Blasey Jr. -- who, not so mysteriously, just happens to be the father of Dr. Christine Blasey.:WhatDoesItMean.com has a long history of fabricating evidence, quotations, and stories, as noted by RationalWiki:Sorcha Faal is the alleged author of an ongoing series of ""reports"" published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don't think much of it. The primary audience of Sorcha Faal's reports and the only ones who take them seriously are usually other conspiracy theorists ...Each report resembles a news story in its style, but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality (e.g. ""American Rebel Forces Attack Gas Pipelines, Explode Trains As US Civil War Nears"") and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service in the same article) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don't contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish.:The Stanford ConnectionStanford University does not operate or manage its own ""CIA Undergraduate Internship Program,"" but rather promotes that internship (which is operated by the CIA itself in Washington, D.C.) to its students, along with several other fellowships and professional opportunities, under the auspices of the university's Haas Center for Public Service.Christine Blasey Ford is a research psychologist at Stanford, not a CIA internship program administrator. None of the posts claiming she directs, leads, or is in charge of the internship program provided any evidence to that effect, and none of them explained or acknowledged that the internship is an external one, run by the CIA itself thousands of miles away from Stanford's campus.The Haas Center for Public Service lists four staff members responsible for advising students on internships and fellowship. including the CIA's undergraduate internship, and Blasey Ford is not one of them. This claim of a direct personal link between Blasey Ford and the CIA, via Stanford University, therefore falls down.:However, as an institution Stanford does have a history of working with the CIA, especially as part of Project MKUltra, a shadowy CIA-sponsored program in the 1950s and 1960s in which scientists and researchers, especially in the field of psychology, used drugs and other techniques to experiment with behavior modification and mind control.Stanford was just one of dozens of universities, research institutions, and hospitals across the United States that served as venues for such experimentation, which was at times illegal and unethical for using human beings as subjects, sometimes without their knowledge or consent. (Famously, the ""Unabomber"" Ted Kaczynski was subjected to brutal psychological experimentation, suspected to have been part of an MKUltra sub-project, while he was a promising mathematics student at Harvard in the late 1950s.)In January 1973, CIA Technical Services Director Sidney Gottlieb -- the infamous poisons expert who oversaw the MKUltra program -- destroyed many documents relating to the substance of the experiments  upon the order of then CIA Director Richard Helms, the U.S Senate would later hear. However, in 1977 a Freedom of Information Act request uncovered a trove of material, mostly invoices and other financial documents, relating to the program.:Among that trove were hundreds of pages establishing the fact that Stanford University had been one of the dozens of institutions where MKUltra experimentation took place. The documents are now available on the web site of the university itself and indicate that MKUltra activities occurred at Stanford from around 1953 to 1964, with many of the orders and invoices signed by Gottlieb himself.Ralph Blasey IIIHere's how the BrassBalls blog explained this strand of the conspiracy theory:Christine Blasey's brother [Ralph] used to work for the international law firm of Baker Hostetler. The firm created Fusion GPS, the company who wrote the Russian ""dossier"". They later admitted it was only a collection of field interviews. Baker Hostetler is located in the same building where the CIA operates three companies called Red Coats Inc., Admiral Security Services, and Datawatch. They are operated by Ralph Blasey II. He is the father of Christine and Ralph III.:This component of the overall theory is riddled with factual errors, fabrications, and logical failures.According to his LinkedIn profile, Ralph Blasey III (Christine's brother, and the son of Ralph Blasey Jr.) did indeed once work as a litigation partner for Baker Hostetler in the firm's Washington, D.C. office.But Baker Hostetler did not ""create"" Fusion GPS, as the blog post claims. Rather, in 2017 Fusion GPS told the Washington Post that they had performed some work as a subcontractor for Baker Hostetler, who were representing a Russian holding company in a money laundering case brought by the U.S. Justice Department. (More information about Fusion GPS' place in the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections can be viewed here.)However, Fusion GPS told the Post that their work for Baker Hostetler began in 2013, while Ralph Blasey III stopped working for the law firm in 2004, nine years before they engaged Fusion GPS.:Baker Hostetler's Washington, D.C. address is 1050 Connecticut Avenue Northwest. None of the three companies listed in the conspiracy theory as CIA fronts run by Ralph Blasey Jr. (Christine's father) has offices at that address. Ralph Blasey Jr. is listed as Vice President for Business Development of one of them, Red Coats, Inc., a Bethesda, Maryland-based cleaning company.Admiral Security Services (which provides security guard and concierge services) is a division of Red Coats, and Datawatch Systems is owned and operated by the same people but located at a different address (albeit within walking distance in Bethesda.)Ralph Blasey Jr. works for only one of those three companies, none of which shares an address with Baker Hostetler (the law firm which Ralph Blasey III, in any case, left in 2004) or has been shown by any evidence whatsoever to be ""operated"" by the CIA.Like many other companies in the Washington, D.C. area, Datawatch Systems, which provides doorway and access security services, does have contracts with several federal government departments and agencies, as does Red Coats, Inc., and Admiral Security Services. However, none of them has a contract with the CIA.:This attempt to link Christine Blasey Ford to the CIA through her brother Ralph therefore fails on several fronts.Nick DeakBefore we get to the substance of this part of the conspiracy theory, it's worth pointing out the profound logical flaw at the heart of it. The underlying premise here is that, if Christine Blasey Ford's grandfather was an intelligence agent, she herself must therefore be steeped in spycraft and have the same interests, temperament, and profession as her grandfather. Anyone with a different personality or career to that of their grandfather will instinctively recognize this assumption as nonsensical.In any event, the claim here is that Blasey Ford's grandfather was the legendary CIA-linked currency trader Nicholas ""Nick"" Deak. Without offering any evidence of a familial relationship, the BrassBalls blog stated that ""Christine and Ralph III's grandfather was Nicholas Deak. Former CIA Director William Casey acknowledged Deak's decades of service to the CIA."":Deak has been the subject of speculation and fascination for decades. In 1964, Time magazine called him ""the James Bond of the world of money,"" writing:Born in Hungary 58 years ago, Deak holds a doctorate in economics, can talk money in five languages, used to work for the League of Nations. A naturalized American, he spent World War II as an [Office of Strategic Services] agent parachuting into Burmese jungles to search for Japanese prisoners. On a postwar assignment, he sneaked Hungarian boxcars past the Russian occupiers to help rebuild West Germany's railways. Deak still keeps in OSS trim with a vegetarian diet, daily sprints around his own suburban running track, and ski trips with his Viennese wife. From a paneled office (cable address: Deaknick) overlooking lower Manhattan harbor, he supervises more than 100 agents working for Deak & Co., one of the world's biggest dealers in foreign currencies.In 1985, Deak was shot dead (along with his receptionist Frances Lauder) at his office in Lower Manhattan by Lois Lang, a homeless woman with a history of mental illness. Because of Deak's life-long connections to the CIA and a recent scandal which had implicated his firm in money laundering on behalf of international crime organizations, theories have been put forth that Lang was not merely motivated by her own delusions, as investigators concluded, but was acting under the direction of nefarious and organized forces, criminal or governmental.:In 2012, Arkadi Kuhlmann, who replaced Deak as CEO of his firm, told Salon of his own skepticism about the official account of his predecessor's murder:""I never believed that the whole thing was random,"" said Kuhlmann, in an interview with Salon. Ditto the government inquiry that triggered the collapse preceding Lang's rampage. ""We were the CIA's paymaster, and that got to be a little bit embarrassing for them,"" he said. ""Our time had passed and the usefulness of doing things our way had vanished. The world was changing in the '80s; you couldn't just accept bags of cash. Deak was slow at making those changes. And when you lose your sponsorship, you're out of the game.""Whatever the truth about the death of Nicholas Deak, one thing is clear: he was not Christine Blasey Ford's grandfather. Multiple news articles before and after his death stipulated that he had only one child, a son named Robert Leslie, also known as ""Les.""This information obviously rules out the possibility that Deak was Blasey Ford's maternal grandfather, and since we know her father is Ralph Blasey Jr., we can say with certainty that Deak was not her paternal grandfather either. This eliminates the third and final component of the conspiracy theory, as articulated by Michael Savage and others.:Interestingly, the WhatDoesItMean.com does not claim that Deak was Blasey Ford's grandfather, but rather connects the two by way of another figure from a bygone era, Dr. Frederick Melges:Though the American people were correctly told that Nicolas Deak assassin Lois Lang had previously been under psychiatric care, this report continues, what was failed to be reported to them was that Lang had been under the direct care and medical supervision of the CIA's own Stanford University Psychiatric Professor Dr. Frederick T. Melges just prior to her traveling from Seattle to New York City to carry out this assassination--and who was the exact type of assassin Dr. Melges had been working to create in his CIA-funded mind control MKULTRA programme--and whose Canadian victims of are still being silenced after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, this past December, imposed a gag order on them to keep them silent--but that does apply to Judge Kavanaugh accuser Dr. Christine Blasey, who remains able to teach her CIA Undergraduate Internship Program at Stanford University the MKULTRA mind control techniques discovered by Dr. Melges.The claims that Lang had been treated by Dr. Melges, and that Melges was associated with the MKUltra project, was written about in Salon's 2012 account of Deak's death::In August 1975, records show that Lang was discovered naked and catatonic in a Santa Clara motel room ... Police responding to the motel room took Lang to nearby Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. For the next month, she was put under the care of Dr. Frederick Melges, a psychiatrist associated with the Stanford Research Institute. One of Dr. Melges' main areas of research: drug-aided hypnosis. A few years after Lang was put in Melges' care, the New York Times exposed the Stanford Research Institute as a center for CIA research into ""brain-washing"" and ""mind-control"" experiments in which unwitting subjects were dosed with hallucinogenic drugs and subjected to hypnosis ...The Stanford Research Institute received CIA funding, and Dr. Melges published work about using drugs and hypnosis to create ""disassociative states,"" i.e., induced schizophrenia. One of Melges' partners on these experiments was a doctor named Leo E. Hollister, who first dosed Ken Kesey with LSD as part of an Army experiment in 1960. He later admitted to author John Marks that he conducted drug research for the CIA ...In other words, the doctor who cared for Lang in Santa Clara was a senior figure at one of the CIA's top institutional grantees. He worked side-by-side with a self-identified CIA collaborator, and conducted research into the kind of drug-induced behavior modification that the agency is known to have funded.:We were unable to verify the claim that Dr. Melges took Lang into his care in 1975, or what that treatment might have entailed. Frederick Towne Melges (known as ""Rusty"") was a psychiatrist from Battle Creek, Michigan, who received his medical degree from Columbia University before working at the University of Rochester and Duke University in later years.In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Melges worked at Stanford University, researching the perception of time. He conducted studies into the effects of cannabis and alcohol on time perception, personal perceptions of the future, persecutory delusion among people with acute mental illness, and several subjects related to human emotion. Some of his research involved administering doses of THC (the hallucinatory component in cannabis) as well as alcohol.We were not able to verify the claim that Melges worked at the Stanford Research Institute, and it is unclear whether he ever took part in any MKUltra-related experimentation. However, even if one accepts for the sake of argument the claims made by WhatDoesItMean.com and Salon, no meaningful link exists between Dr. Melges and Christine Blasey Ford.:Melges, who suffered from diabetes, died at the age of 52 in Durham, North Carolina, in July 1988, having worked at Duke University since 1977. Blasey Ford got her undergraduate degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1988, then received a master's in clinical psychology from Pepperdine University in 1991, a PhD in educational psychology from the University of Southern California in 1996, and a master's in epidemiology from Stanford University in 2009.She and Melges never attended or worked at the same university contemporaneously. The earliest record we could find of Blasey Ford's working at Stanford was in the year 2000, by which time Melges had been dead for 12 years (and had left Stanford more than a decade before that).Even if Melges were associated with the MKUltra program, the fact of Christine Blasey Ford's attendance and employment at Stanford several decades later does not even come close to establishing a link between the two."
35,35,559.FakeNewsWhySnopesPre,"Arriving as a new employee to Snopes in fall 2018, I discovered that this storied fact-checking operation, a household name in the fight against ""fake news,"" preferred to avoid using the term ""fake news.""""Ok ...,"" I Slacked.Nevermind the phrase raining down in conversations with friends and waterfalling over comment threads I monitor for Snopes. I wasn't ready to argue with my new bosses. I opened my umbrella and carried on.According to one archive, President Donald Trump has tweeted the phrase ""fake news"" more than 450 times as president. Often in his tweets ""fake news"" stands proxy as a vague noun that lets him impugn whole industries of journalists at once, including you know who::The more I wrote around the phrase ""fake news"" in my work writing social media posts and other Snopes copy, the more bizarre it felt. Like we'd stripped ""giant"" from David's style guide.Speaking of Davids, founder of Snopes.com David Mikkelson pointed out to me that Snopes was using the term ""fake news"" long before Trump was employing it as a near-daily insult. In fact, many people were. As Merriam-Webster observed, ""'Fake news' is a new term. That means it's only about 125 years old.""For a while around 2013-14, Snopes and others in the fact-checking industry understood and used ""fake news"" narrowly, to refer specifically to (the relatively small) set of websites that intentionally pumped out fabricated stories for laughs, for lucrative clicks, or for other reasons we may never understand. Whatever the motive, the content produced by these sites was often so absurd you (almost) did not need a fact-checker to point out it was fake.For example:::Things change.More than one recent Snopes investigation has uncovered clandestine and coordinated efforts by entities pretending to be something they are not online. And their actions appear to be politically motivated.Meanwhile, the prevalence of ""deepfake"" videos is raising alarm about how even savvy users can be fooled by deceptively altered and edited content.And of course, ""fake news"" is a feared threat to elections worldwide. One of the first things despots do in democratic societies, Snopes managing editor Doreen Marchionni sometimes reminds us, is to demonize journalists. Take down the journalists -- in print, in broadcast, online or on social platforms -- and so goes democracy.In a recent interview, journalist Maria Ressa criticized social media platforms for failing to accept their responsibility in the spread of misinformation and disinformation. ""They broke democracy,"" she told CBS News.:Not surprisingly, as the implications of ""fake news"" have shifted, so too has the definition.When ""fake news"" was introduced to Dictionary.com in 2017, Time magazine was already noting there was more than to the phrase than was captured in its recorded definition.Craig Silverman, a media editor for BuzzFeed News who has been credited with helping to mainstream the phrase, wrote that he came to cringe at it:The end of ""fake news"" as I knew it came on Jan. 11, 2017, when Donald Trump -- master of branding -- redefined the term to mean, effectively, news reports he didn't like. The previous day CNN and BuzzFeed News had reported on the existence of the Steele dossier. [...]Political movements around the world recognized the genius of Trump's tactic and adopted it. Now, ""fake news"" is a global phrase uttered by leaders and citizens alike. It's emblazoned on T-shirts, used in memes, abused as a hashtag. It's never been more ubiquitous and, as a result, more confused and manipulated.:He wasn't alone. Washington Post columnist Margaret Sullivan had already called for the term's retirement altogether, arguing its meaning had been lost:""Instead, call a lie a lie,"" Sullivan advised. ""Call a hoax a hoax. Call a conspiracy theory by its rightful name. After all, 'fake news' is an imprecise expression to begin with.""This was also my boss' contention with the phrase. ""Information doesn't necessarily have to be fake or false to qualify as 'fake news,'"" Mikkelson explained.One ""fake news"" creator in Macedonia confirmed as much to the BBC:""That thing happened, the people were there, the place was there. So it was never fake stories"" in the sense of fabricating every detail. ""It was propaganda and brainwashing in the way of telling the story."":The contradiction doesn't seem to trip up readers. According to a 2017 Gallup/Knight Foundation Survey on Trust, Media and Democracy:Americans themselves have not reached a clear consensus on what constitutes ""fake news."" Most adults agree that false information portrayed as if it were true always (48%) or sometimes (46%) deserves the label ""fake news."" Strikingly, most Americans also say that accurate stories portraying politicians in a negative light always (28%) or sometimes (51%) constitutes ""fake news.""""Fake news"" evolved to signify not a measure of a claim's veracity but, rather, its potential for challenging one's preferred perception.As The Atlantic noted in an analysis of a 2019 Pew Research Center study, there can be a consequence to perceiving information as threatening:While nearly six in 10 Democrats have dropped an outlet over perceived fake news, a full 70 percent of Republicans have. A much larger portion of Republicans has also reduced their overall consumption of news. The less politically aware are also 20 percent more likely to have reduced their overall consumption of news than the more politically aware -- meaning that people who were already acquiring the least information are now acquiring even less.:At Snopes we strive to contribute information to public discourse, not subtract from it. If ""fake news"" can no longer reliably signal whether a piece of reporting is trustworthy, and instead behaves like a rhetorical middle finger, it doesn't have a place in our work.So what to say instead?AP Stylebook suggests alternatives such as ""false reports,"" which misses the point for our purposes. Again, information doesn't have to be ""false"" to be considered ""fake news"" in common parlance. A ""big person"" does not a ""giant"" make.Mikkelson favored ""junk news"" as a more useful label. And he pointed me to an interesting rationale explained by Centre for Internet and Society researcher Tommaso Venturini:So, if ""fake news"" is not about false information, what is it about? ... spread, rather than fakeness, is the birthmark of these contents that should be called ""viral news"" or possibly ""junk news"" for, just as junk food, they are consumed because they are addictive, not because they are appreciated.:This is not to argue engaging with misinformation is not tantamount to indulging in the occasional cheeseburger. Rather, it seems logical that a media diet that favors junk would have consequences, just as a real diet that has an excess of sodium and fat. Venturini again:'Junk news' is dangerous not because it is false, but because it saturates public debate, leaving little space to other discussions, reducing the richness of public debate and preventing more important stories from being heard.In other words, the threat of junk news lies in the absence of what it's displacing: actual information.In a 2017 report on ""Information Disorder,"" researchers Claire Wardle and Hossein Derakhshan recommended several steps for tackling the problems of all manner of misinformation. Number one on that list?1. Definitions. Think more critically about the language we use so we can effectively capture the complexity of the phenomenon:Put another way: ""Media literacy works, and it just might save humanity,"" according to Columbia Journalism Review.Back to that Pew study:""Of the 52% of Americans who say they have shared made-up news themselves, a vast majority of them said they didn't know it was made up when they did so.""This highlights the challenge: We cannot fight what we cannot see. We cannot change what we cannot name.By using the phrase ""junk news,"" we aim to emphasize the distinction between misinformation and content created purposely to deceive.More precision, not less, is key if we want to understand better and be better understood.:Most useful of all, by using ""junk news"" we can clearly signal such content's best possible destination:The trash."

But the video provides no documentation whatsoever that any aspect of that narrative is true: it offers no proof at all that the buses seen in the video were originally parked at the airport next to an inbound UPS flight, no proof that any passengers were carried on that UPS cargo flight, no proof that any supposed passengers from that arriving (cargo) flight were loaded onto waiting buses, nor any proof about of the point of origin or political status of these alleged passengers. The clip is nothing more than a dark, shaky phone video shot by someone driving behind some nondescript buses as they passed signs indicating they were near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, accompanied by some conspiracy theory narration lacking any shred of evidence to back it up.Moreover, no one else reported witnessing the arrival or offloading of the buses comprising this alleged secret refugee convoy at any end destination.In response to the video, a spokesperson from UPS flatly denied that passengers had been unloaded from any of their planes at the Harrisburg airport::UPS is a cargo airline and has not been involved in passenger flights of any kind into or out of Harrisburg. Suggestions to the contrary are based on misinformation.The notion that refugees are being smuggled into the country on international mail flights conforms to the standard urban legend type of a secret government plot's being revealed through the inexplicable choice of using a commercial carrier to carry out a key element of the furtive operation."
37,37,590.IsPeterStrzokaCIAOpe,"Claim:FBI agent Peter Strzok II grew up in Iran; had a father who engaged in clandestine activities overseas under the guise of doing charitable work; served as a ""Middle East intel operative"" in the Obama administration; and was a CIA agent ""placed"" in the FBI to help Hillary Clinton win the presidency.Rating:UnprovenAbout this rating Longtime FBI agent Peter Strzok II, who until recently served as deputy assistant director of the agency's Counterintelligence Division, gained public notoriety when he was removed from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Trump-Russia investigation for sending private text messages critical of the president.:Formerly the lead FBI investigator into Hillary Clinton's use of a private e-mail server while she was secretary of state, Strzok has since come under investigation himself by the Justice Department's inspector general, been grilled on his ethical integrity by the House Oversight Committee, and stands accused by conspiracy theorists of being a linchpin in a ""deep state"" plot to sabotage Trump's presidency.A July 2018 salvo from the far-right blog Big League Politics attempted to make the case that Strzok, who spent part of his childhood in Iran, is a covert CIA operative who served the Iranian regime's interests while allegedly acting as a ""key Middle Eastern Intel operative"" for President Obama, then was ""placed in the FBI to ensure a win for Hillary Clinton"" in the 2016 presidential election.That salvo was a mishmash of accusations derived in part from the supposed ""insider"" testimony of an anonymous former co-worker of Strzok's, in part from misreadings of public documents (including decades-old press clippings about Strzok's father), and in part from a labored effort to connect dots that simply aren't there.:The post began as follows:EXPOSED: Peter Strzok Grew Up In Iran, Worked As Obama and Brennan's Envoy To Iranian RegimeA former co-worker of Peter Strzok tells Big League Politics about Strzok's extensive background in the intelligence community, including the fact that he grew up in Iran. Many intelligence officers like Strzok are complete ghosts with questionable history and gaps in their life story. But now we have some insight. (RELATED: Strzok Worked For CIA And FBI At Same Time, According To Document).Peter Strzok was born in the late 1960's - he attended the American School in Iran up until 1978 when it closed down and then he attended the American School in Saudi Arabia. He supposedly attended a Catholic School, St. John's Prep in Minneapolis (the school refused to confirm or deny attendance) and then completed a Bachelors at Georgetown and some form of graduate degree after that.The truth is that after Peter Strzok III turned 18 his life is arcane, which is the usual story of many like him. Did you know that Peter Strzok II (Strzok's father) and Hillary Clinton have a lot in common? It turns out after advocating for Khomeni in Iran and then working in Saudi Arabia to calm the waters of an Iranian government (appeasing them with anti-Semitic rhetoric), Strzok's father Strzok II also dabbled in ""charity work."" Strzok's father was involved in so-called charity work in Haiti but also helped dismantle and reassemble Upper Volta..now known as Burkina Faso.:We interrupt here to point out that the author of the post appears to have misstated several details: Peter Strzok wasn't born in the late 1960s; he was born on 7 March 1970 (according to a birth announcement in the Sault Sainte Marie, Michigan Evening News). His father is Peter Strzok Sr., not Peter Strzok II (Strzok Sr.'s father's name was Michael, not Peter). Peter Strzok II is FBI agent Peter Strzok. Unless the latter fathered a namesake, there is no Peter Strzok III.The claim that Strzok ""grew up"" in Iran is an overstatement. The Strzoks moved there while Strzok Sr. was serving in the Army Corps of Engineers, from which he retired in July 1978. While we don't know precisely how long the family resided there, the Eau Claire, Wisconsin Leader-Telegram reported in 1979 that the Strzoks left Iran at the beginning of that year to return to the U.S. because of the political unrest that followed the overthrow of the Shah. Peter was eight years old at the time.The same article said that Strzok Sr. was then considering taking a job in Saudi Arabia. It's unclear whether he did or not. If the Strzok family did move to Saudi Arabia, it was for a very short period of time, given that Strzok Sr. accepted a job with the international aid organization Catholic Relief Services (CRS) in 1980 and relocated his family to Upper Volta (a country in Africa now known as Burkina Faso). The Strzoks would be there for three years.:As for his schooling, the younger Strzok attended the American School in Tehran (where his mother also taught), as claimed. We've not been able to confirm that he attended school in Saudi Arabia. Once back in the United States, Strzok didn't ""supposedly"" attend St. John's Preparatory School (as the Big League Politics blogger put it) -- he did, in fact, attend that school (which is in St. Cloud, Minnesota, not Minneapolis) from 1983 through 1987, and his graduation notice appeared in the St. Cloud Times on 15 May 1987. He later earned bachelor's and master's degrees at Georgetown University (as noted on an alumni donor list published on the school's web site).An outsized portion of the Big League Politics post was devoted to Strzok's father's life, as if to posit that father and son have been operating some sort of ""deep state"" conspiratorial family business for the past 40 years. The author went to great lengths to impute insidious motives to Strzok Sr.'s overseas humanitarian projects, which -- far from being something he ""dabbled"" in (as the post describes it) -- to all appearances became his life's work after he retired from military service.Strzok Sr. served as the director of Catholic Relief Services in Upper Volta for three years. There is no evidence that he ""helped dismantle and reassemble"" that country, which underwent a military coup while he was there. Strzok ran a food assistance and nutrition education program that served some 150,000 children and mothers. Nor, contrary to another claim in the post, was he still present in Upper Volta when its name was changed to Burkina Faso in 1984 (not 1985, as claimed).:In mid-1983 Strzok accepted the post of CRS director in Haiti. We know he was there for less than two years, because a New York Times report published in August 1985 names ""former employee"" Peter Strzok as one of three complainants in a dispute over Catholic Relief Services' alleged mishandling of funds. His time in Haiti coincided with the final few years of the rule of Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier, who would be overthrown in 1986.Our blogger took a special interest in the fact that Strzok Sr. lived and worked in a succession of international hot spots, repeatedly insinuating that he must have been engaged in espionage or other clandestine activities. ""Looks like whenever there is a regime change in modern history a Strzok is lying in the shadows waiting,"" the post said. But ironically, far from ""lying in the shadows,"" the only reason we know as much as we do about Peter Strzok Sr.'s whereabouts over the past 40 years is that he spoke so freely and openly about his activities in the press. We can't prove he wasn't a covert operative, of course, but neither has anyone else demonstrated that he was.One of the oddest claims in the post was that Strzok Sr. was involved in the Iran-Contra affair (involving the illegal sale of arms to Iran to fund the Contras in Nicaragua), which took place during the mid-1980s under President Reagan. We were unable to find evidence that Strzok played any role at all in Iran-Contra, or was mentioned in the news coverage or congressional hearings that followed the scandal. The coverage that does exist about Strzok from that time indicates that he was actively engaged in doing humanitarian aid work in West Africa.:There was also an attempt to link Strzok Sr. up with the Clintons:The Clinton Foundation and The Catholic Relief Services (CRS) seem to work in tangent [sic]. Coincidence? Peter Strzok Sr. was actually the director of CRS in Haiti. If we look into CRS financials they seem to overlap and feed into Clinton Global initiatives and balance sheets.Never mind that the Clinton Foundation wasn't launched until 1997, more than a decade after Strzok left CRS and founded his own non-government agency, AFGRO (Agency to Facilitate the Growth of Rural Organizations). Whatever ""overlap"" there may be, or have been -- if any -- between the Clinton Foundation and Catholic Relief Services, no such thing could have existed when Strzok was involved with the latter organization.The purpose of asserting these nonexistent connections was to create the appearance of a continuum of father-son involvement with Iran, Haiti, and the Clintons::We know Peter Strzok III [sic], the man who sent those vile text messages about our President. The man who was biased and wanted to ensure a Clinton Presidency was raised in Iran and Saudi Arabia.Our source reveals how Strzok and his father both talked about Iran favorably and both accidently reminisced about the rose water smell of the ju-jeh kebab by Shemiran Hill... something that disappeared after 1987 and only those who are old enough to remember can discuss.Peter Strzok's Persian is impeccable.Our insider tells us that Peter Strzok III [sic] is the key Middle Eastern Intel operative for the Iranian airline Mahan Air's purchase of United States government planes during the Obama administration from 2011 to 2013 (when Iran sanctions were in place). He handled the Iranian relations from start to finish. Just like his father did for Reagan and just like he's been doing for years under cloak and dagger says the BLP insider.Once again, we have searched for any scrap of documentation that might prove that Peter Strzok II (the FBI agent) served as ""the key Middle Eastern intel operative"" in negotiations between the U.S. and Iran during the Obama administration, and we found none. As an FBI counterintelligence officer, there is no reason why the younger Strzok would or could have played such a role anyway. :Big League Politics had a ready explanation for this, though, namely that Strzok was actually working for the CIA:The BLP insider who's worked with both [former CIA director John] Breannan [sic] and Strzok tells us that Strzok was never FBI he was part of the highest level of covert operatives, sliding into posts within the CIA or FBI to infiltrate, influence and observe. This is exactly what we saw with the Special Counsel appointment that resulted after a failed operation.Peter Strzok Jr. was placed in the FBI to ensure a win for Hillary Clinton and buffer negative press (like the Weiner laptop case, which he covered up). That's the real deal. Revealing Peter Strzok's identity would have been a problem because it's called unmasking but since he is in the limelight and out of the shadows it's time to lay all the cards FACE up on the table for all to see who Peter Strzok really is.In addition to citing the anonymous informant as the source of this claim, the post linked out to an article referencing an unclassified document that supposedly proved Strzok worked for the CIA and the FBI at the same time::A [sic] unclassified document printed on FBI letterhead dated January 20, 2016, which contains the subject line ""Supplemental Classification Review and Determination"" was addressed to the Bureau of National Security's Assistant Secretary Gregory B. Starr from Peter Strzok who is listed as ""Section Chief"" of the ""Counterespionage Section"" in reference to Strzok's CIA post. Keep in mind, this is not an FBI post as Strzok's position at the FBI is ""Deputy Assistant Director Counterintelligence Division"" not ""Section Chief"" which is a CIA post.Which is utter nonsense. Although the specified document did list Strzok's title as ""section chief"" of the Counterespionage Section, it's patently untrue that section chief isn't an FBI post. Both agencies have sections and chiefs (and assistant section chiefs). Not only was section chief precisely the position Strzok held before being promoted to deputy assistant director at the FBI, but others have held that title, too.The claim that Strzok was ""placed in the FBI to ensure a win for Hillary Clinton"" is flatly absurd. Strzok joined the agency in 1996. Was the plot to ensure a Hillary Clinton win in 2016 already in motion 20 years beforehand?:The Big League Politics post was a clumsy, error-ridden effort to generate a ""deep state"" conspiracy theory around FBI agent Peter Strzok, who, up until the text message incident that derailed him in 2017, seems to have trodden a fairly straightforward career path in the agency over a period of more than two decades.Peter Strzok spent several years of his childhood in Iran, but he did not ""grow up"" there. There is no evidence nor any good reason to suppose that he acted as an ""envoy"" or ""intel operative"" in U.S. dealings with Iran at any time during the Obama administration. And the claim that Strzok is or was a covert CIA operative ""placed"" in the FBI to help Hillary Clinton win the presidency and subvert the Trump administration is a flight of fancy divorced from all evidence and logic."
38,38,452.DidCBSReportThatElit,"Claim:CBS reported that elites are ingesting the blood of young children in order to achieve 'eternal youth.'Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 26 December 2018, the News Punch junk news site (formerly the equally disreputable Your News Wire junk news site) published an article claiming that CBS had reported on ""world leaders and elite businessmen"" who supposedly  ""ingest the blood of young children in order to achieve 'eternal youth'""::CBS: Elites Are Lining up to Ingest the Blood of ChildrenWorld leaders and elite businessmen are ingesting the blood of young children in order to achieve 'eternal youth,' a CBS report warns.What was once dismissed as a 'conspiracy theory' is now being publicly acknowledged by billionaires and the mainstream media.That News Punch report was typically distorted and deliberately misleading, intended to foster a false picture of vampiric patrons feasting on the blood of children to maintain themselves in a state of youthful immortality.The underlying information that formed basis of the News Punch article did not come from CBS News, but rather from a two-minute, speculative health segment produced by Philadelphia television station KYW.  And that segment did not state, or even remotely suggest, that anyone was ""ingesting"" the blood of ""young children"" in order to ""achieve eternal youth.""That KYW segment was itself mostly a brief rehash of some recent studies which found that giving older mice infusions of blood plasma from younger mice seemingly improved the former's performance in learning and memory tests.  Other studies are ongoing to determine whether the process might have any applicability in human beings::The segment also referenced the efforts of a company called Ambrosia, which as reported by Wired, performed a controversial human trial on a small group of subjects over age 35 whom they charged $8,000 each to receive a few liters of plasma donated by young adults:In 2016, a company called Ambrosia launched the first human trial of young plasma transfusions, charging patients $8,000 a pop to participate. Anyone over 35 with the necessary cash was eligible to receive two liters of plasma donated by young adults, which Ambrosia purchases from blood banks. Given the fee and the lack of a placebo treatment to compare it to, scientists and bioethicists have questioned the rigor of the study. But those barbs haven't stopped Ambrosia's founder, Jesse Karmazin, from being bullish on the (unpublished) results of the trial, which he announced for the first time at the Recode technology conference last May.""We measured 113 biomarkers 30 days after the transfusion and we saw a durable, but not permanent, effect,"" says Karmazin, who has an MD from Stanford but no license to practice medicine. (He initially conducted the trial with a physician who runs a private intravenous therapy center in Monterey, California, but later moved to sites in San Francisco and Tampa after a falling out between them.) Karmazin says the study participants described feeling stronger, more awake, and as if their memory had improved. ""We saw results that were consistent with the preclinical work in mice.""Ambrosia's trial initially intended to enroll 600 patients, but in the end only included 81 individuals.:The effectiveness -- and advisability -- of even that small Ambrosia trial has been challenged by those who maintain it holds the potential to do more harm than good:Irina and Michael Conboy, two University of California at Berkeley researchers who've published research on young blood transfusions in mice, called Ambrosia's plans ""dangerous.""""They quite likely could inflict bodily harm,"" Irina Conboy [said].Michael Conboy said part of the problem is simply the fact that there's too much old blood for the young blood to have a substantial effect on its own.""Is there really something in the young blood that would override all the negative effects from the old blood?"" Conboy said. ""Until someone repeats that I'm not sure that I believe it. Even scientists with the best of intentions can observe something that's a fluke.""Meanwhile, the Conboys said there are substantial risks with giving older people the young blood of donors. Those include a heightened immune response which is triggered with increasing magnitude every time the procedure is completed.:The important points here are that 1) Nobody involved in any such studies (which are still largely confined to rodents) is ""ingesting"" the blood of children -- the few research efforts using humans to date involved subjects' receiving infusions/transfusions of blood plasma, not drinking blood, and 2) Even the controversial Ambrosia trial used blood plasma donated by young adults, not ""young children.""  In no case are ""world leaders and elite businessmen ... lining up to ingest the blood of young children,"" as falsely claimed by News Punch."
39,39,94.NoTrumpDidntMurderaW,"Claim:Donald Trump murdered a woman named Carolyn Gombell in 2000. Rating:FalseAbout this rating In response to U.S. President Donald Trump's penchant for spreading conspiracy theories (in particular, the insinuation that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough killed an intern years ago), his critics on social media invented a conspiracy theory of their own: Trump, they claimed, killed a woman named Carolyn Gombell in 2000.The rumor started with a tweet from God on May 26, 2020::That and subsequent tweets in a thread started by the Twitter account TheTweetOfGod (hereafter referred to as ToG) followed a pattern similar to that of conspiracy theories pushed by Trump and his supporters: It made an outlandish claim and then attempted to prove it true by ""connecting"" a series of dots. ToG, for instance, followed up this claim with several ""FACTS"" about the alleged incident. ToG claimed that Gombell's mother had an audio recording of ""her daughter the night before she was killed saying, 'If something happens to me it was Donald.'"" ToG claimed that Officer Bernard Kerik had written in his autobiography that he had made ""certain inconvenient facts disappear"" for a ""a certain well-known real-estate magnate."" And ToG claimed that Gombell's roommate, Michelle White, died of ""suicide"" just two weeks after Gombell's death.:But the coup de grace, a fixture of so many conspiracy theories, was the claim that verifiable information regarding Gombell's death had been mysteriously scrubbed from all of the usual places as part of a cover-up.Taken at face value, these ""facts"" paint a damning picture: The President of the United States killed a woman in 2000. Even for readers with a slightly more discerning eye, this thread still ""raised questions"" and suggested that Trump was likely involved in some sort of nefarious activity.:Before we start pulling apart this set of claims, let's make something clear: Donald Trump did not murder a woman named Carolyn Gombell in 2000. Carolyn Gombell never existed.This thread was posted on May 26, 2020, the same day Twitter announced that it would not remove Trump's tweets pushing a debunked conspiracy theory about MSNBC's Joe Scarborough supposedly killing an intern named Lori Klausutis, despite her widower's pleas that the platform do so. ToG created a conspiracy theory that mirrored this and others pushed by the president, except that ToG's conspiracy theory was directed at the president himself.""Facts"" #1 & #2: Where's the Evidence?While some may disagree with ToG's tactic, it does give us an opportunity to pull apart a conspiracy theory to show just how it was put together. ToG's first ""fact"" claims that there's an audio recording of Gombell naming Trump as her potential killer. However, saying something exists does not make that thing exist. As you'll notice, this viral thread does not actually link to an audio file of Gombell making this statement.:ToG's second ""fact"" makes a similarly baseless claim. While this account says that forensics first ""matched the residual thumbprints found on Carolyn's neck as 'matching' Trump's own (small) hands,"" they provide no supporting evidence to back up this claim. ""Fact"" #3: A Nonexistent BookIn ToG's third fact, we finally have something that we can truly investigate. Not only does ToG claim that ""Kerik"" (referring to former New York Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik) wrote about the incident in his 2009 autobiography ""One Good Cop,"" but ToG also provides the alleged page number. At first glance, this detail makes it seem like this rumor is valid and verified. ToG, after all, just provided a source for his claim and most readers are not going to take the time to look up this passage. If they did, however, they'd see that this book does not actually exist. :Kerik has written two autobiographies about his experiences as police commissioner and as the minister of the interior of Iraq, and his jailing for fraud and lying to authorities, but neither of these books was titled ""One Good Cop."" The first, published in 2001, was titled ""The Lost Son: A Life in Pursuit of Justice,"" and the other, published in 2015, was titled ""From Jailer to Jailed: My Journey from Correction and Police Commissioner to Inmate #84888-054."" Although Kerik did not write a book entitled ""One Good Cop"" in which he admitted to ""disappearing evidence"" for a certain ""real estate mogul,"" we imagine that his name was included in this thread for a reason. It grounds this conspiracy theory at least partly in reality -- Kerik, after all, was a real and controversial figure -- and provides interested parties an opportunity to ask some suspicious questions: Why did Trump issue a full pardon to Kerik? Was it because Kerik helped him cover up a murder?While ToG did not make this specific accusation, the account did provide just enough information to let people start drawing their own conclusions. :The Death of Michelle White?The fourth ""fact"" provided by ToG insinuates that not only did Trump murder a woman named Carolyn Gombell, supposedly, but he also had her roommate killed to cover up the crime. ToG does not directly make this accusation, either. Rather, they put the words ""committed suicide"" in quotation marks to imply that while this is the official narrative, it may also not be the truth. This is another common tactic used by purveyors of misinformation (notably those spreading the similar ""Clinton Body Bags"" conspiracy theories for the past quarter-century). We searched Newspapers.com for articles reporting that a woman named ""Michelle White"" threw herself in front of a train in New York in 2000, but again, we came up empty-handed. The ""Cover-Up""Why weren't we able to find any information about a woman named Carolyn Gombell? According to ToG, it's because all of the information regarding her death has been scrubbed from the internet as part of a massive cover-up to protect Trump. While this certainly sounds suspicious -- damning, even -- it also provides convenient cover to hide a baseless claim.:The fact of the matter is that searching the internet for articles on the death of Carolyn Gombell doesn't yield many results, not because these articles were deleted as part of a cover up, but because they never existed in the first place.It Starts with a Joke...When we first came across ToG's thread on May 26, 2020, we thought it was obvious that this Twitter account was using the language of conspiracy theorists to make a point about how easy it is to start a baseless rumor, and also to challenge social media platforms to enforce their content policies. Soon thereafter, however, we started to receive queries from people who thought that there might be some truth to the claim that Trump killed a woman in 2000. The day following ToG's thread, fake obituary pages were published for ""Carolyn Gombell"" on websites such as DeadDeath and Ever Loved. The hashtag #JusticeForCarolyn also trended on Twitter as social media users spread the baseless claim. While this may seem an obvious ruse now, in May 2020, it's easy to imagine people being taken in by this claim if they were to encounter it for the first time a week or a month afterward. :Did President Trump Murder a Woman Named Carolyn Gombell in 2000?No. This conspiracy theory was invented in May 2020 as a criticism of President Trump for spreading baseless rumors, and of the social networks that allow him to do so. Did Joe Scarborough Murder an Intern in 2001?No.In May 2020, President Trump repeatedly insinuated that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough had murdered a woman. The president, just like the ToG Twitter account, made outlandish and evidence-free claims, asked leading questions, and provided just enough detail to let his followers start connecting imaginary dots:   :The biggest difference between Trump's tweets and those of TheTweetofGod is that Trump's accusations deal with the death of real woman, Lori Klausutis, who died in 2001, reportedly as a result of a heart condition. But this is not a ""cold case,"" as Trump claims, and MSNBC host Joe Scarborough is not a murder suspect. In fact, Scarborough was hundreds of miles away at the time of Klausutis' death."
40,40,158.DidaScientificStudyP,"Claim:A scientific study demonstrated that conspiracy theorists are generally more sane than other people.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Back in 2014, the decidedly pro-conspiracy website Natural News, whose founder Mike Adams sometimes serves as a guest host for Alex Jones' Infowars, gleefully exclaimed that science had proved conspiracy theorists are generally ""more sane"" than people who hold more ""conformist"" views -- as evidenced by their publication of an article headlined ""Scientific Study Reveals Conspiracy Theorists the Most Sane of All."":In point of fact, the study referenced in that article, whose sole dataset comprised comments left by readers of news articles that included the term ""9/11"" and similar keywords, did not make such a claim. That paper, titled ""'What About Building 7?' A Social Psychological Study of Online Discussion of 9/11 Conspiracy Theories"" made a series of qualitative observations based on 2,174 collected comments, as follows:We found that conspiracist commenters were more likely to argue against the opposing interpretation and less likely to argue in favor of their own interpretation, while the opposite was true of conventionalist commenters. Conspiracist comments were more likely to explicitly put forward an account than conventionalist comments were.Conspiracists were more likely to express mistrust and made more positive and fewer negative references to other conspiracy theories. Conspiracists were largely unwilling to apply the ""conspiracy theory"" label to their own beliefs and objected when others did so, lending support to the long-held suggestion that conspiracy belief carries a social stigma.Conventionalist arguments tended to have a more hostile tone.:Natural News derived their assertion that ""conspiracists"" are ""more sane"" from combining the latter observation about tone with their own severely flawed understanding of sampling biases:The researchers noted that they were surprised to find that it is now more conventional to leave so-called conspiracist comments than conventional ones. ""Of the 2174 comments collected, 1459 were coded as conspiracist and 715 as conventionalist,"" the researchers wrote ...That means the pro-conspiracy commenters are those who are now expressing what is considered conventional wisdom, while the anti-conspiracy commenters represent a small, beleaguered minority that is often scoffed at and shunned.That inherently flawed interpretation relied on the somewhat terrifying assumption that the views expressed in the comments section of news articles about the September 11th terrorist attacks were a representative cross-section of the population as a whole, a rather harrowing notion. In fact, it should be unsurprising that the majority of the comments collected by the researchers were pro-conspiracy theory, as that is explicitly the kind of comment the researchers searched for::For each article that resulted from these searches [of keywords such as ""9/11""], the public comment sections were read, and from these, we extracted verbatim all relevant comments regarding the 9/11 conspiracy theories.The study did not even capture a representative sample of the comments left on news stories about 9/11, much less the views of the broader population about 9/11. Therefore, the study cannot be used to make the claim that ""pro-conspiracy commenters are those who are now expressing what is considered conventional wisdom.""With regard to the tone of comments, it is unclear where Natural News got the idea that the hostile tone of a comment responding to a 9/11 conspiracy indicates a lack of sanity, but the study at no point makes any claim about comparative sanity levels.The study did conclude, however, that ""conspiracism is rooted in several higher-order beliefs such as an abiding mistrust of authority, the conviction that nothing is quite as it seems, and the belief that most of what we are told is a lie."" The study also noted that their results aligned with previous observations ""that conspiracy theories rely heavily on 'errant data' rather than on crafting coherent alternative explanations."":If a hostile tone betrays a lack of sanity, then Natural News -- an outlet whose operator created an entire website named ""Hoggwatch"" dedicated to harassing Parkland school shooting survivor and gun control activist David Hogg -- must be in desperate need of some rationality."
41,41,592.SwineFluWarning,"Claim:   The CDC has warned that the swine flu is wiping out villages in Asia and will kill 60% of the U.S. population.FALSEExample:   [Collected via e-mail, August 2009]Latest on H1N1 straight from the CDC and Johns HopkinsI'm not a bearer of 'fear', but think we all should pay attention to THIS one.The CDC says H1N1 is currently wiping out entire villages in Asia . They expect it to hit the US in Jan/Feb where it will kill 6 out of 10 people. It HAS mutated. (Throw out the conspiracy theory) They will attempt a program of mandatory vaccinations but probably will not have enough time to enforce it. I will not be vaccinated. The last time they did mandatory vaccinations at least one person died and many others developed Guillain-Barre syndrome, which is a devastating illness.:They have not let the public know because they don't want people to panic, but to people who know, they are suggesting the following:Start stocking up on food now. They expect that martial law will be put into effect. You won't be able to go to work or shop for food -- you will be shot.Buy facial masks made by 3M - #N95.Use Purell obsessively. Oh, this is interesting: This pandemic was predicted years ago by a Russian mathematician. It's impetus was the Tsunami a few years ago. I know that by spreading this information I'm taking the risk of looking like an alarmist, but this is straight from the mouths of the CDC and Johns Hopkins.   Origins:   When the A(H1N1) virus, commonly known as the ""swine flu,"" was identified in April 2009, it quickly became a hot news topic and a subject of widespread discussion that prompted many people to seek out information about its causes, effects, rate of spread, methods of prevention or avoidance, etc.  The intense public interest in the U.S. has abated somewhat since then but will likely pick up as North America approaches its ""flu season"" of fall and winter.:Meanwhile, viral (no pun intended) e-mails on the subject of swine flu have continued to circulate; unfortunately, most of them are alarmist collections of unsubstantiated, exaggerated, or outright false information.   The item cited above is one example of such -- nearly every statement it contains falls into one of these classes:The CDC says H1N1 is currently wiping out entire villages in AsiaIf swine flu were truly wiping out ""entire villages in Asia,"" this would be a major event reported by news media around the world.  Yet no such reports have appeared either in the news or on the web site of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and the latest update from the World Health Organization (WHO) records only 1,154 confirmed H1N1-related deaths worldwide.  (The WHO's tracking chart of confirmed H1N1 deaths shows only one area with more than 10 deaths in all of Asia.)  They expect it to hit the US in Jan/Feb where it will kill 6 out of 10 people.The CDC has not made any statement to the effect that it expects swine flu to kill 60% of the U.S. population (or even 60% of the U.S. residents who contract it).  The A(H1N1) virus has been classified as ""relatively mild"" since it was first detected in April 2009, and the CDC simply notes that swine flu activity in the U.S. is expected to increase as winter approaches, with the potential for the disease to -- in addition to other viruses -- cause significant illness (including, in some cases, death)::Given ongoing novel H1N1 activity to date, CDC anticipates that there will be more cases, more hospitalizations and more deaths associated with this pandemic in the United States over the summer and into the fall and winter. The novel H1N1 virus, in conjunction with regular seasonal influenza viruses, poses the potential to cause significant illness with associated hospitalizations and deaths during the U.S. influenza season.Even in the absence of an effective vaccine, the WHO's current projections estimate only that one out of every three persons worldwide might contract swine flu over the next two years, resulting in ""thousands of deaths"" among a group of 2 billion people -- nowhere near the 60% mortality rate claimed above.  It HAS mutated.To the contrary, as of late August 2009 the CDC was still reporting that the H1N1 flu strain was not mutating:The H1N1 flu strain doesn't appear to be mutating as it makes its way through the Southern Hemisphere, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a briefing.One of the biggest fears has been that the virus, which first appeared in April in the U.S. and Mexico and which people don't have any built-up immunity to, might mutate into an even more dangerous form. Health officials have been keeping a close watch on the Southern Hemisphere, which is in its winter season now, to see what form of the virus is likely to travel north as fall comes to the U.S. and the rest of the Northern Hemisphere.Flu viruses are unpredictable, so the fact that this one hasn't mutated is ""somewhat reassuring"" said Jay Butler, director of CDC's H1N1 Vaccine Task Force.Case numbers in the Southern Hemisphere appear to be dropping, he said.:They will attempt a program of mandatory vaccinations but probably will not have enough time to enforce it.A swine flu vaccine is not expected to be widely available in the U.S. until mid-October 2009.  Although Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Kathleen Sebelius announced in July 2009 that the federal government expects to initiate a swine flu vaccination program in the fall, she also stated that the program would be voluntary, not mandatory:Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius told [attendees of a flu summit] that they should prepare for a mass vaccination program this fall, the start of the traditional U.S. flu season.""While we have made no final decisions about its scope, and have 'off ramps' built into our decision-making process if the circumstances change, at this point, we expect to initiate a voluntary fall vaccination program against the 2009 H1N1 flu virus,"" Mrs. Sebelius said. ""This will depend on the availability of a safe vaccine and the absence of changes in the virus that would render the vaccine ineffective.""The last time they did mandatory vaccinations at least one person died and many others developed Guillain-Barre syndrome, which is a devastating illness.:This statement is presumably a reference to the 1976 Swine flu vaccination program, known as the National Influenza Immunization Program (NIIP).  Although a causal connection was never definitively established, the possibility that the vaccine might have resulted in an increased incidence of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), an inflammatory disorder in which the body's immune system attacks part of the peripheral nervous system, was one of the factors that led to the termination of the program:What NIIP did not and could not survive was finding cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) among persons receiving swine flu immunizations. As of 1976, >50 ""antecedent events"" had been identified in temporal relationship to GBS, events that were considered as possible factors in its cause. The list included viral infections, injections, and ""being struck by lightning."" Whether or not any of the antecedents had a causal relationship to GBS was, and remains, unclear. When cases of GBS were identified among recipients of the swine flu vaccines, they were, of course, well covered by the press. Because GBS cases are always present in the population, the necessary public health questions concerning the cases among vaccine recipients were ""Is the number of cases of GBS among vaccine recipients higher than would be expected? And if so, are the increased cases the result of increased surveillance or a true increase?"" Leading epidemiologists debated these points, but the consensus, based on the intensified surveillance for GBS (and other conditions) in recipients of the vaccines, was that the number of cases of GBS appeared to be an excess.:It should be noted, however, that the primary reason for the termination of the NIIP was that the feared swine flu epidemic it was intended to combat never occurred.  Had there been a swine flu epidemic, the benefits of timely vaccinations would have far outweighed the relatively small risks: Had H1N1 influenza been transmitted at that time, the small apparent risk of GBS from immunization would have been eclipsed by the obvious immediate benefit of vaccine-induced protection against swine flu. However, in December 1976, with >40 million persons immunized and no evidence of H1N1 transmission, federal health officials decided that the possibility of an association of GBS with the vaccine, however small, necessitated stopping immunization, at least until the issue could be explored.Since a current swine flu vaccine has yet to be put through clinical trials and rolled out to large numbers of people, no one could possibly know what connection (if any) there might be between such a vaccine and GBS.  Moreover, it's something of a logical disconnect to assert that a particular contagion is going to cause the death of 60% of the population, yet suggest people should avoid being vaccinated for it because of a minuscule chance that taking the vaccine might result in the recipient's contracting a different illness.  :They have not let the public know because they don't want people to panic. They expect that martial law will be put into effect. These types of statements are commonly found (almost verbatim) in all manner of unsubstantiated, alarmist e-mails, covering scenarios fromY2K-related chaos to the United States' surrendering its sovereignty to the United Nations. We have yet to encounter a single case in which such statements proved to be true.  This is straight from the mouths of the CDC and Johns Hopkins.As noted above, neither the CDC (nor Johns Hopkins) has issued any such statements as the ones claimed above.Rather than relying on and disseminating misinformation about swine flu passed along through anonymous, unsourced e-mails, we'd advise readers to obtain their information from reputable public health agencies such as the CDC and the WHO.

42,42,567.NoTuckerCarlsonDidnt,"Claim:Tucker Carlson revealed credible evidence of widespread voter fraud in Georgia.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Six months after a disinformation campaign pushed by former U.S. President Donald Trump and his supporters alleging mass-scale voter fraud incited a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Fox News host Tucker Carlson took to his show to again promote similar claims.:In the lead-up to and aftermath of the 2020 election, Trump and his supporters falsely claimed the election was ""stolen"" by means of a massive voter fraud conspiracy, but never presented evidence for these claims that withstood scrutiny. Trump's own Department of Homeland Security stated that the 2020 election, which took place during a pandemic, was, in fact, ""the most secure in American history."" Georgia's ballots have been counted three times.None of the lawsuits put forward by Trump or his supporters were successful in court and in fact, Trump's attorney in the matter, Rudy Giuliani, had his law license suspended for spreading election lies.Despite the fact that there is no evidence for claims of mass voter fraud and even though those claims have led to deadly violence, Carlson persisted in promoting them.The segment that aired on July 14, 2021, contained various claims that have either been already debunked, or are statements based on supposition and lack evidence. (We note that Carlson's employer, Fox News, argued in a court case that Carlson's show shouldn't be viewed as factual.):During his July 14 primetime show, Carlson stated, ""It now appears there actually was meaningful voter fraud in Fulton County, Georgia last November."" He later added, ""That is not a conspiracy theory. It's true.""Carlson's July 14 segment cited the findings of an activist group called VoterGA. The group supports Trump's false claims of massive election fraud and has embarked on a search for evidence of said fraud.Here's how Georgia Public Broadcasting described the group:The primary plaintiff is Garland Favorito of the group VoterGA, who has fought against Georgia's elections infrastructure for more than a decade, including a failed lawsuit against Georgia's old direct-recording electronic machines. Favorito has also questioned the authenticity of events surrounding 9/11, pushed conspiracy theories about former President Bill Clinton and the assassination of John F. Kennedy and is now serving as the latest vessel for false claims of fraud with the 2020 election.We will now look at the claims Carlson made on his show.:The Alarm at the Fulton County Election WarehouseThe segment opened with a weeks-old piece of disinformation about an alarm sounding at an election warehouse in Fulton County. Carlson stated:On a Saturday night in late May of this year, an alarm sounded in a big nondescript warehouse in Fulton County, Georgia. The warehouse was an unlikely place for a burglary. It was under round-the-clock surveillance by both private security and local law enforcement including armed deputies with the Fulton County Sheriff's Office.Any unauthorized person entering from the outside would have to get past a locked 100-pound steel door, as well as a maze of motion detectors -- not easy -- but someone tried to do it, anyway and at just the perfect moment, 20 minutes after the deputies in charge of guarding the warehouse left their posts.By the time those deputies returned to check out the alarm, someone had opened the 100-pound door to the warehouse. So, what happened that night? And why? We still don't know.:In fact, we do know.Georgia Public Broadcasting reporter Stephen Fowler took to Twitter to point out that not only did Carlson use a photograph taken by Fowler without crediting him, the photograph was lifted from a story that explains why an alarm went off and what happened with the door.:Fowler reported in June 2021 that the alarm didn't come from the area where ballots were secured.""The source of the alarm was a motion detector in an upstairs office belonging to the Clerk of Superior Court in the warehouse, and the county said a test showed that alarm is audible from where the private security officers were stationed off property.""As for who opened the door, it was law enforcement.Fowler reported that two off-duty Douglas County Sheriff's officers in a marked patrol car approached the warehouse and found the outer door unlocked.""The officers opened it themselves, and it was not 'left wide open,'"" as pro-Trump media had reported at the time, Fowler explained in the report.'Double-Scanned Ballot' Claim:Carlson claimed VoterGA found double-scanned ballots accounted for more than 3,300 votes for President Joe Biden and 865 votes for Trump. But there's no evidence thousands of double-scanned ballots were reflected in Georgia's official vote tally.""Surveillance footage obtained by VoterGA appears to show large numbers of ballots being scanned multiple times,"" Carlson stated. In this segment, Carlson directed viewers' attention to a woman wearing a yellow shirt in a video he said was obtained by VoterGA.But that video doesn't prove that the state's election results were falsified by ballots scanned multiple times, and importantly, Georgia's election results were recounted after the election, including by hand. That means that if any ballots were scanned more than once, in order for it to end up in the final vote tally, those ballots would have needed to have been counted more than once in both the heavily-scrutinized machine recounts and in the hand counts of the ballots.The video used by Carlson was from a surveillance camera at State Farm Arena in Atlanta, where ballots were being processed on the night of the election. Investigators looked into allegations of fraud at that time and found no evidence of wrongdoing.:The closest Carlson came to offering an independent source for the figures he regurgitated from VoterGA was a July 13 report by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC). In doing so, not only did Carlson acknowledge that VoterGA is a problematic source on its own, he also misrepresented the Journal-Constitution's report. Carlson stated:Now before you dismiss [attorney] Bob Cheeley and Voter GA as dishonest partisan actors, keep in mind that the strongly left of center ""Atlanta Journal Constitution"" appears to agree with this at least in outline. The newspaper reviewed the available digital ballot images independently and concluded that hundreds of ballots were improperly duplicated.The AJC didn't report that ""hundreds"" of ballots were improperly duplicated. It reported that ""nearly 200"" ballots were scanned twice before a recount. An important part of the AJC report left out by Carlson was that there was ""no indication any vote for president was counted more than once in official results.""The newspaper, which offered readers the opportunity to look at ballot images themselves, further reported::The ballots counted twice would have given Biden 31 extra votes. After a recount, official results reflected that Trump gained a total of 121 absentee votes in Fulton. Biden won the county with 73% of 524,000 votes cast.The Atlanta Journal-Constitution also verified the duplicate ballots in ballot images obtained under the Georgia Open Records Act and posted online.Although it's true that a small number of ballots were duplicated in Fulton County, the numbers are nowhere near as large as Carlson claimed; and contrary to what Carlson stated, the amount wouldn't have changed the outcome of the presidential election.'Seven Falsified Audit Tally Sheets' Had 'Fabricated Vote Totals'The source for this assertion is a July 13 news release posted by VoterGA which claimed that the group found ""7 falsified audit tally sheets containing fabricated vote totals for their respective batches."" :This claim originated with a comparison made by VoterGA between ballot batches from the initial election machine count to ballot batches from the state's manual recount and audit, per Mark Niesse, reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution who has covered the election and its aftermath.But a discrepancy between those two numbers is not evidence of fabricated vote totals or even of wrongdoing. At this time, we don't know how election workers sorted and counted ballots.But Niesse pointed out that neither the initial count nor the audit were the the official, certified vote totals for the presidential race. The official results came from the machine recount requested by Trump. He also pointed out that the official tally closely matched the initial count.'None of the Ballots Had Any Creases on Them""Carlson cited a ""whistleblower"" who stated she saw mail-in ballots without creases on them. :""That's strange because of course mail-in ballots need to be bent in order to be mailed in,"" Carlson observed.Georgia election official Gabriel Sterling explained this to The New York Times in an interview published Jan. 4 about false election fraud claims being promoted by Trump and his supporters:TRUMP'S CLAIM: That officials improperly counted ""pristine"" ballots -- meaning ballots that weren't folded, indicating that they hadn't arrived in an envelope.STERLING'S EXPLANATION: ""Pristine"" ballots aren't unusual, Mr. Sterling said. For instance, many military and overseas voters receive electronic ballots that they print out, complete and mail back. But these printed ballots aren't the right size for scanners, so election workers have a standard process for transferring the votes to scannable ballots. A ballot that gets damaged and can't be scanned may be transferred in the same way.The Claim That Voters Moved:""""Nearly 35,000 Georgia voters moved out of their county of residence more than a month prior to election day,"" Carlson said. ""They were ineligible to vote. And yet they did.""This claim comes from a July 12 story published by the pro-Trump website The Federalist. Although the article cites an ""expert in voter data analytics and residency issues"" named Mark Davis, it doesn't link to his work. It only reports that he compared two different databases, the U.S. Postal Service national change of address database and data from the Georgia Secretary of State's Office, and came up with a figure: 35,000 Georgians registered a change of address but voted in their old county.But The Federalist admitted the reason for this isn't known and it may be perfectly legitimate in most cases:While some of those nearly 35,000 voters may have been students, members of the military, or may have only relocated temporarily--situations which do not affect an individual's residency for purposes of election law--everyone else in this group voted illegally under Georgia law. Now we are seeing from Davis' further research that as of May 2021, more than 10,300 of those individuals have updated their voter registration to their new address, thereby confirming that the move they had previously informed the USPS of was permanent.:Insinuating that there were 10,300 votes cast by people illegally is pure supposition, however. No evidence is offered that this number, if accurate, represents 10,300 illegally cast votes. About that, The Washington Post reported that ""If true -- again, this is unproven third-party analysis -- it's illegal in the sense that going 67 in a 65 is illegal, not in the sense that you're driving a stolen car."""
43,43,691.WillaDoomsdayAsteroi,"Claim:NASA is lying about the path of a recently discovered asteroid, and it will actually cause widespread destruction when it hits Earth in February 2017.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 25 January 2017, the Daily Mail published a report with the terrifying headline: ""A doomsday asteroid will hit Earth next month and trigger devastating mega-tsunamis, claims conspiracy theorist"". If ever you wanted a textbook example of the balance fallacy (when two sides of an argument are represented as having comparable value regardless of their merits), or of revenue-driven, shameless pseudoscientific clickbait, this would be the place to see it in the wild.:On one side of the debate you have NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. It is a large collection of professionally trained scientists, some of whom have spent decades specifically studying the science of asteroid tracking, engineers who are trained to operate multi-million dollar instruments to perform said tracking, and offices whose sole purpose is to monitor the trajectory of near earth objects. This organization's NEOWISE mission detected an object dubbed 2016 WF9 on 27 November 2016. After collecting enough data on its orbit, they reported that it was no threat to Earth on 29 December 2016:2016 WF9 will approach Earth's orbit on Feb. 25, 2017. At a distance of nearly 32 million miles (51 million kilometers) from Earth, this pass will not bring it particularly close. The trajectory of 2016 WF9 is well understood, and the object is not a threat to Earth for the foreseeable future.On the other side of the debate (as framed by the Daily Mail), you have ""Self-proclaimed Russian astronomer Dr Dyomin Damir Zakharovich"" who says NASA is lying, and that it will hit Earth on 16 February 2017::'The object they call WF9 left the Nibiru system in October when Nibiru began spinning counter clockwise around the sun,' he said.'Since then, Nasa has known it will hit Earth. But they are only telling people now.'If the asteroid hit Earth, he says, it could destroy cities or cause a tsunami. 'We are all in peril.'The UK tabloid Metro also reported on this mysterious astronomer:Dr Zakharovich believes that there's a global conspiracy to conceal the existence of Nibiru - orchestrated by the leaders of Russia and the West.Two quick notes on the Zakharovich hypothesis. The ""Nibiru system"" refers to an as yet undetected planet in the outer reaches of our solar system, whose name is rooted in a misreading of ancient Babylonian texts, and which has been the basis for myriad predictions (many of which have come and gone) of our civilization's ultimate demise. While an undetected planet may well exist in our solar system, there is a fairly specific area in which it would be found, and nothing leaving that distant region of space in October is going to be hitting us this February -- even if it were on the right trajectory.:Second, even the Daily Mail seems to think the man on whom  they have based their entire article may not exist:The name 'Dyomin Damir Zakharovich' seems to have only appeared online in recent months, relating to doomsday reports regarding the fictional planet Nibiru.What we do know for sure, though, is that all available data suggests it is not a risk to our planet. That data is sufficient enough for NASA to have mapped out a Lonely Planet-caliber tour guide for its trip through the inner solar system:It's in an orbit that takes it on a scenic tour of our solar system. At its farthest distance from the sun, it approaches Jupiter's orbit. Over the course of 4.9 Earth-years, it travels inward, passing under the main asteroid belt and the orbit of Mars until it swings just inside Earth's own orbit. After that, it heads back toward the outer solar system. Objects in these types of orbits have multiple possible origins; it might once have been a comet, or it could have strayed from a population of dark objects in the main asteroid belt.:"

Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.During a violence-filled weekend of protests by supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones made statements about Trump's soon-to-be successor, President-elect Joe Biden, which some observers interpreted as a threat.:The statement by Jones, who runs the conspiracy trolling network Infowars, was made on Dec. 12, 2020, during a rally in Washington, D.C. by Trump supporters protesting the results of the presidential election, which they claimed was rife with fraud. Four people were stabbed and one person was shot during the weekend's protests. Dozens were arrested.""I don't know who's going to the White House in 38 days but I sure know this,"" Jones screamed into a microphone. ""Joe Biden is a globalist, and Joe Biden will be removed one way or another.""The commentary was captured on video and posted to Twitter by journalist Zachary Petrizzo:: Jones is a longtime and prolific promoter of conspiracy theories on his Infowars platform, which he also uses to hawk herbal supplements. He has been sued by the family members of the young children murdered by a mass shooter at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, for aggressively promoting the narrative that the shooting was a hoax.The conspiracy theory promoted by Jones resulted in the families of those children being targeted with death threats, stalking, and harassment from Jones's followers. At least two people have been arrested for crimes associated with harassing victims' families because of the hoax conspiracy theory.The term ""globalist"" is a reference to an overarching conspiracy theory often promoted by Jones which posits that a secret cabal of powerful people is plotting to subvert U.S. sovereignty. The word is often used as an anti-Semitic slur.:Trump's own administration has undermined Trump's persistent claims that the election, which he lost by an estimated 7 million votes and 74 electoral college points, was fraudulent, stating that it was in fact the most secure election in American history.Nevertheless, Trump and his supporters have continued to push the false claim, even as various public officials targeted by his ire have stated that resulting anger from Trump's supporters against them is growing more threatening and potentially violent."
45,45,335.DidUniversityofFlaLa,"Claim:Six masks worn to school by children were sent to a University of Florida laboratory and found to carry at least 11 dangerous pathogens.Rating:MixtureAbout this rating ContextParents in Florida sent the University of Florida Mass Spectrometry Research and Education Center six masks to be tested for various pathogens. Results determined that they tested positive for at least 11 pathogens, some of which are common human flora and/or commonly found in soil and water. The findings were not the result of a regimented, peer-reviewed study, however, and do not support the conclusion that wearing masks could be doing more harm than good. Because there was no standardization in collecting the samples, the results did not indicate to what extent masks may collect harmful pathogens. :Snopes is still fighting an ""infodemic"" of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. In June 2021, a research facility at the University of Florida tested six masks worn by children during their school day and found that at least 11 disease-causing pathogens were present on the mask material. Following publication of the results by Florida newspaper Alachua Chronicle, a COVID-19 conspiracy theory Facebook group called PANDA promoted the findings as evidence in a June 18 post to suggest that wearing masks could be doing more harm than good, as did politically conservative websites like Town Hall and the conspiracy theory-promoting website Rational Ground. In an email to Snopes, the University of Florida confirmed that a laboratory affiliated with the college had conducted the lab test, but that the institution did not have plans to release the report. :""The University of Florida Mass Spectrometry Research and Education Center routinely conducts lab tests for members of the public as requested, as it did for Ms. Donoho. However, it is important to note that we had no way of establishing the chain of custody for these masks and to what conditions they were exposed prior to the lab test,"" a spokesperson told Snopes. ""To draw any conclusions is premature and a more controlled, peer-reviewed research is warranted. It is also important to note that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention studies indicate wearing a mask is among the most effective measures for preventing and mitigating the spread of COVID-19.""Snopes spoke with Kari Basso, director of the Mass Spectrometry Research and Education Center at the University of Florida (MSREC), who tested the masks and shared the findings with us directly. Before we go into the details of Basso's conclusions, it is important to note that what she found was not the result of a standardized study, nor have the findings been published in a peer-reviewed journal. Furthermore, some medical experts have expressed concern over how the study was conducted and how the results were used to question the safety and efficacy of wearing masks. The World Health Organization described the findings as a ""pseudo-study."" :MRSEC is a service facility where anyone can send samples for analysis. In particular, Basso employs the use of proteomics, a study of the expression of genes that uses the structure and function of their proteins to sequence genomic data. A method known as liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is used to analyze microorganisms like bacteria by extracting proteins, treating each with an enzyme to cut the protein into smaller fragments, and then measuring these fragments in such a way that the sequence is determined. Bacterial species can be detected at the strain level to identify microorganisms at all taxonomic levels, according to a 2015 study published in the journal Systematic and Applied Microbiology. LC-MS/MS is different than the traditional culturing of bacteria, which takes a sample of bacterial cells and multiplies microbial organisms to determine what types are present. Basso instructed parents to put a fresh mask on their children. At the end of the day, they were told to put it in a zip-closed bag and place it in the freezer. A 1-centimeter square was cut from the center region of two cotton-based masks, a neck-gaiter, a T-shirt, and three surgical masks. These samples were compared against three blank masks (fresh and not worn) that were provided as a control sample. From the 1-centimeter squares, a sample was cut into smaller pieces before being placed overnight in a solution to extract the proteins.  :The small-scale study did not differentiate the inside of the mask from the outside, so it is impossible to say whether the bacteria came from the skin and saliva of the child wearing the mask, or whether the mask had been contaminated through external contact. And because Basso did not directly oversee how the parents collected the mask samples, it is unclear at what point in the process they may have become contaminated. Simply put, Basso was able to determine what pathogens were present on the masks but not how they came to be there.Below were some of the highlighted bacteria found on the masks and the conditions they can cause, according to the lab results:PathogenDescriptionAcinetobacter baumanniCommonly found in soil and water and can cause infections in the blood, urinary tract, and lungs. Infections typically occur in people in healthcare settings and the bacteria can spread from one person to another through contact with contaminated surfaces.Streptococcus pyogenesA common bacterium that can cause strep throat, rheumatic fever, scarlet fever, and other skin infections. Streptococcal bacteria can spread through the respiratory droplets of an infected person or via shared food or drinks.:Porphyromonas gingivalisThis bacterium can live in the oral cavities of people and is common in individuals with poor oral hygiene or periodontal diseaseStaphylococcus aureusStaphylococcus bacteria is found on the skin and in the nose of healthy individuals but in some cases can cause skin infections ranging from minor boils to endocardium, a life-threatening condition of the heart. Staph bacteria are also one of the most common causes of food poisoning.Neisseria meningitidisMeningitidis bacteria are common and responsible for nearly 90% of disease caused by that bacterial species worldwide. The bacteria is found in the nose and throat of about one in 10 people without causing illness. When it invades the body, the bacteria can cause serious disease.Rickettsia rickettsiiR. rickettsia is the bacterial agent responsible for Rocky Mountain spotted fever, a disease that is only spread through the bite of an infected tick.Corynebacterium diphtheriaeDiphtheria is a serious infection caused by strains of this bacteria, however, most public school systems require childhood vaccination that protects against infection.:Legionella pneumophilaLegionella bacteria are naturally found in freshwater environments but can cause an infection when they grow and spread in human-made water systems like showerheads, hot tubs, and plumbing systems. People can contract a serious lung infection known as Legionnaires' disease when they breathe in small droplets of water that contain the bacteria. Despite hyperbolized accounts of the above bacteria in media reports, a majority of the pathogens are common and rarely cause severe illness or disease. And as the study itself noted, not all bacteria are harmful or pathogenic -- many of those listed in the above table are part of the human flora on skin, saliva, or in the gut, and are natural to the environment in soil and water. In several of the samples, the most abundant proteins detected are human proteins found in saliva and skin. So while the listed pathogens can be dangerous, their detected presence alone isn't enough to suggest that wearing masks may present an increased risk of exposure to deadly diseases. :Basso told Snopes that she was ""shocked"" by her results and that they present an opportunity for further study, but that it is not within her expertise to determine if it is factual to say that wearing masks does more harm than good. As of this writing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that those who are not fully vaccinated or who have a condition that may weaken their immune system should continue to wear masks in public."
46,46,271.WomanStandsbyDescrip,"Lynne Knowles didn't expect a Facebook Live video she made about getting followed by a strange man in a grocery store to rack up millions of views, but the Pinellas County, Florida, resident's warning to friends wound up being a viral sensation.Knowles posted the video on 17 September 2018, warning women that she had seen men lurking around parking lots, and that one man had gone so far as stalk her as she shopped at a Publix grocery store near her home in August. ""Be very careful,"" she warned. ""Ladies, tell your daughters. Men, tell your daughters they've got to be careful coming in and out of parking lots. They've got to be very aware of their surroundings and carry their keys in their hands. If nothing else, have a head set on because it at least looks like you're hooked up to a phone and can call 911 immediately"": :As a result of the video, Knowles has been featured in a number of local news stories, some of which reported that local police countered perhaps her most explosive comment: that the incidents she described were evidence that human trafficking was afoot in Pinellas County.""There's human trafficking going on,"" Knowles said in the video. ""There are men posted all over parking lots, they're following women and they're trying to grab them."" (The video, captioned, ""PLEASE BE AWARE OF THE DANGER OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING!!"", had been shared a quarter of a million times and viewed by 8.3 million people as of 19 September 2018, just two days after it was posted.)Pinellas County Sheriff's Sgt. Spencer Gross told us police have seen no evidence of a rash of attempted kidnappings or human trafficking activity in the area. He said Knowles didn't report the incident in which she was followed in the grocery store to police, but he added that investigators are trying to track down the other encounters described in the video: ""We arrested a guy two weeks ago who followed a woman into a restaurant bathroom and recorded her. We do have creepers, and we do investigate those. Are we seeing an increase? I wouldn't say an increase but we do get those complaints."":Some Facebook users accused Knowles of spreading hoaxes and ""fake news."" Others poked fun at her or criticized her for promoting ""hysteria."" For her part, Knowles told us she didn't report the Publix incident because after she confronted the man, he stopped following her.Knowles said that after she posted her video, multiple women reached out to her to relay similar experiences. ""I'm grateful for the literally millions of people who have reached out and said thank you,"" Knowles told us in a phone interview. While she has received some negative feedback, ""the good much outweighs the bad.""Knowles told us she stands by every incident she described and maintained that while it may not be human trafficking, women are definitely experiencing scary incidents: ""I can't tell you exactly what's going on but it's happened multiple times. When you live somewhere and you know six or seven people who have the same experience -- I was trying to warn my friends, I had no idea it would ever go viral.""One incident happened the same day Knowles posted the video, she said, when an older woman entered the Earth Origins health food store she was shopping at and reported she had been followed by a man through a parking lot who he tried to accost her. ""She was scared to death,"" Knowles recounted in the video. ""She's a trauma nurse, she told me, and she said she's never been so scared in her life. I understand because I was rattled by what happened at Publix."":What happened to Knowles is hardly unusual. According to a February 2018 study on sexual harassment and assault lead by the non-profit organization Stop Street Harassment, the vast majority of women, some 81 percent, have experienced some form of sexual harassment and/or assault in their lifetimes, and 34 percent of women reported they have been followed. Furthermore, public spaces (such as grocery stores) are where sexual harassment most frequently occurs, according to the study. Most sexual harassment is perpetrated by male strangers, and a third of women reported experiencing anxiety or depression after such incidents.Holly Kearl, executive director of Stop Street Harassment, told us Knowles' concerns for women's safety are legitimate. In an email, she stated that ""these are common and very scary occurrences for women,"" adding that ""If a woman has had this kind of experience and/or if she's heard about men attacking, kidnapping, raping or killing women in their area, they will feel less safe and more wary of any man they don't know who approaches them.""The term ""human trafficking"" refers to ""modern-day slavery and ""involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion to obtain some type of labor or commercial sex act."" Although victims of human trafficking come from an array of backgrounds, they are often recruited from socially-vulnerable groups. Many victims are migrants, and roughly a quarter of the world's 40.3 million trafficking victims are children. :According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security:[Traffickers] look for people who are susceptible for a variety of reasons, including psychological or emotional vulnerability, economic hardship, lack of a social safety net, natural disasters, or political instability. The trauma caused by the traffickers can be so great that many may not identify themselves as victims or ask for help, even in highly public settings.It's no surprised Knowles initially suspected her safety concerns were related to human trafficking, because the term has been rocketing around the Internet, although it is often employed in the service of bogus conspiracy theories. The Pizzagate conspiracy theory perhaps most famously (and falsely) accused 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and other prominent Democrats of running a child trafficking ring out of a basement at a Washington, D.C. pizza restaurant (which actually has no basement).Since the Pizzagate phenomenon, similarly outlandish claims have been fed into cyberspace, including a June 2018 incident in which a group of men stumbled into what they claimed to be a ""bunker"" used for child sex trafficking. Police investigated and determined the ""bunker"" was nothing more than an abandoned homeless encampment. (Child trafficking is also a key component to the far-fetched but popular fabrication that is the Qanon conspiracy theory.):Regardless of terminology, Knowles said the reason she posted her video was to warn women to be careful and had no ill intent. ""The video speaks for itself and the intent was only to bring good and awareness to people. That's all."""
47,47,50.WasGinaHaspelFoundDe,"Claim:CIA Director Gina Haspel was found dead in November 2020. Rating:FalseAbout this rating In November 2020, rumors circulated about the whereabouts of CIA Director Gina Haspel. An article reproduced on the conspiratorial Rumor Mill News, for example, claimed that Haspel was arrested for treason. Others claimed that Haspel had been found dead from natural causes. :Both of these rumors are unsubstantiated and are built upon a debunked conspiracy theory about a fictional raid on an election software company in Germany.In the days following the 2020 election, the internet was flooded with conspiracy theories that falsely claimed the election was rigged or fraudulent in some manner. One of the more outlandish theories held that an election software company in Germany had been used to alter the vote tallies in the United States.This theory reached a wide audience after Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas said during a Zoom call that U.S. Army forces had seized servers from the software company Scytl in Frankfurt, Germany. Gohmert also said that his information was based on a tweet and that he did not know the truth, yet conspiracy theorists picked up this thread and ran with it. On Nov. 15, 2020, The Associated Press published an article investigating the rumor, which they determined to be false::CLAIM: The U.S. Army raided the Frankfurt office of the Spanish election software company Scytl to seize servers that had evidence of voting irregularities in the Nov. 3 U.S. election.AP'S ASSESSMENT: False. Both the Army and Scytl told The Associated Press the claim is not true. Furthermore, Scytl does not have offices or servers in Frankfurt, Germany.THE FACTS: Social media users Saturday were sharing reports published by conservative websites claiming servers that would reveal wrongdoing in the U.S. election had been confiscated by U.S. military forces in Germany. Most posts said the servers belong to the software company Scytl, which is based in Barcelona, and some suggested the servers housed information from Dominion Voting Systems.Although this raid did not happen, that didn't stop conspiracy theorists. On Nov. 29, Rumor Mill News reproduced an article (it's not entirely clear where the article originated, but it appears to come from a ""Q drop"" -- an unsourced rumor penned by a person cosplaying as a government official) claiming that Haspel had been severely injured during this raid and that she was then airlifted to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp (GITMO) where she was arrested for treason.  :That article, which misspells Haspel's name numerous times, reads in part:CIA Director Gina Hasple was arrested after she was injured in the Frankfurt Germany CIA building raid to secure the servers.The building had no guards and was unprotected. Hasple pulled in some private special military trained security forces to protect the building from such a suspected raid. When the raid happened Hasple was there......The CIA made up a cover story about the 5 soldiers and one cia operative killed and said they were killed in a helicopter crash.Hasple was air evacuated out. She was flown to GITMO where she was treated and received a tribunal for treason. She agreed to help trump for a lighter sentence of life which can be revoked if she chooses to not cooperate. She has now turned over information on the servers, what they were for and what they did and who was involved.Shortly after this article was published, another rumor started to circulate about Haspel claiming that the CIA director had been ""found dead"" of ""natural causes,"" which led to speculation that the government had actually killed Haspel and that they were now covering up her death. :Some social media users also came across an alleged obituary for Haspel. This obituary, however, was not published by a credible national news organization, or even the local newspaper of Haspel's hometown in Ashland, Kentucky. Rather, this ""obituary"" -- which simply took the aforementioned conspiratorial postings as truth and provided no additional confirmation -- was published on Dec. 1 on deaddeath.com, a website that has previously published premature obituaries based on fake news. For example, they wrote an obituary for ""Carolyn Gombell,"" a non-existent woman featured in a fictional story about U.S. President Donald Trump being a murderer.These rumors about Haspel's death did not originate with credible sources and no evidence has been provided to support them. These rumors stem from a debunked story about a fictional raid on a German software company. As such, we've marked this rumor as ""False."" "

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. Efforts by social media platforms to clean up dangerous English-language misinformation are not being replicated in other languages, notably Spanish, which can have detrimental and even deadly consequences for the platforms' users, advocates say.Election misinformation can spark violence and suppress voter turnout, while COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation can cost lives. But Carmen Scurato, associate legal director and senior counsel for the media and technology justice organization Free Press, told Snopes in a phone interview that advocates began to notice a gap in platform policy enforcement between English and Spanish that became apparent in the run-up to the November 2020 election.:That's when Facebook began stating it was removing content promoting ""militarized social movements,"" such as Qanon.""When we were checking, using Facebook's own search tools, we found the same content in Spanish, and that content hadn't been removed,"" Scurato said. ""We noticed that when content was being removed in English, the same content would stay up on Spanish. We would flag it for the company, and sometimes they would add a label, sometimes they would do nothing. We kept noticing this gap in moderation.""One year later, Free Press and other watchdogs were vindicated when Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen came forward with documents showing, as she stated before Congress, that Facebook's measures weren't being equally implemented:""Currently they are not keeping Spanish speakers safe at the level they do for English speakers. And that's unacceptable,"" she said.:Here's how the Los Angeles Times described the landscape of online misinformation in the lead-up to the 2020 election in a November 2021 report:Across the country, a pipeline of misleading media had been pumping lies and half-truths, in both English and Spanish, into local Latino communities. Sometimes the misinformation mirrored what the rest of the country was seeing: fear-mongering about mail-in ballots and antifa vigilantes, or conspiracy theories about the deep state and COVID-19. Other times it leaned into more Latino-specific concerns, such as comparing candidate Joe Biden to Latin American dictators or claiming that Black Lives Matter activists were using brujeria -- that is, witchcraft.According to Pew Research Center, when it comes to social media, people who identify themselves as Hispanic overwhelmingly use YouTube (85%) and Facebook (72%). Spanish speakers make up a sizable portion of the U.S. population. Spanish is the second most-spoken language in the U.S., with an estimated 41 million speakers.Jacobo Licona, a disinformation researcher for Equis Labs, a polling company that focuses on the Latino community, told Snopes by email that Latinos have a strong tendency to get their news on social media platforms.:""YouTube is a leading source of political news for Latinos, with 64% of registered Latino voters saying they got election information from YouTube,"" Licona stated. ""Latinos also spend twice as much time on YouTube as non-Latino adults. Relatedly, half of Latinos in the United States use WhatsApp, and Equis has found that Latinos who get their news from WhatsApp are most likely to express concern over socialism.""A common problem researchers see is cross-pollination of misinformation across platforms. Often, Scurato said, a video containing misinformation in Spanish will be posted on YouTube, then that video will be picked up and posted on Facebook or in WhatsApp chat channels. (WhatsApp is a chat platform owned by Meta, the parent company that owns Facebook and other popular platforms, including Instagram.)""There's a point,"" Scurato told us, ""where they [the platforms] just need to commit to enforcing their own policies and commit to enforcing them across all languages."":One Facebook post dated April 15, 2021, viewed by Snopes and archived here, spread the debunked conspiracy theory that billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates was using the COVID-19 vaccines to plant microchips in people. The post also imbued the vaccines with apocalyptic religious implications.""Bill Gates is promoting the antichrist vaccine for all nations to then implement the mandatory vaccination certificate, which means a collection of biometric data from each inhabitant, this through a microchip called ID 2020 that would be the mark of the beast,"" the Facebook post read in Spanish.As of Dec. 13, 2021, the post was still live and contained no label marking it as misinformation.Kevin McAlister, a spokesperson for Meta (Facebook's parent company), told Snopes in an email that of the 10 third-party fact-checkers the company contracts with, four fact-check content in Spanish.:Furthermore, the company stated, Spanish is one of the ""highest resourced languages"" when it comes to content review, as one of the most commonly used languages by its platform users. Meta employs U.S.-based, native Spanish-speaking content reviewers, while its artificial intelligence tools are constantly learning various slang and colloquialisms.Meta also stated it has ramped up its efforts to combat COVID-19 misinformation in Spanish. That includes state-specific information directed at users with platform settings in Spanish, and giving free ads to public health organizations -- like Johns Hopkins University, AARP, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services -- that direct legitimate pandemic-related health information to Spanish speakers.Elena Hernandez, a spokesperson for YouTube, told Snopes in an emailed statement:We work diligently to address misinformation on YouTube across dozens of languages. We enforce our Community Guidelines globally, and our automated systems flag violative videos in multiple languages. More than 20,000 people around the world, including many with Spanish and other non-English language expertise, work to detect, review and remove content that violates our policies. We also reduce recommendations of borderline content in every country we operate. Our efforts in this space are ongoing, we're always working to update our systems and improve the platform to prevent the spread of harmful misinformation.:But Haugen stated the issue isn't whether the platforms invest in Spanish-language content moderation; it's whether they invest enough.Dr. Ilan Shapiro, medical director for health education and wellness for AltaMed, a health care provider serving Los Angeles and Orange counties, said that he has noticed recent improvement in vaccination rates among his Spanish-speaking patients. Now, he said, most of his patients come to his clinic having already been vaccinated.He attributes the success to on-the-ground health education efforts by himself and other public health professionals.""I think that we're getting enough information to the community, so that they know if something [they see online] actually stinks,"" Shapiro told us by phone. His website and social media channels, where he posts as ""Dr. Shaps,"" are dedicated to educating people, primarily in Spanish, about the pandemic and vaccines.:But it's hard to keep up with online misinformation, he said, because it's constantly changing.""The most important part is to have conversations,"" he said. ""That's one of the most important things we need to have.""Despite the positive trend, the harm may have already been done. The pandemic has disproportionately impacted Latino communities. Reuters reported that election-related or political disinformation that flourished during the 2020 election cycle had the potential to affect the vote and even spark violence.""It's definitely neglect,"" Scurato said of the platforms' handling of the crisis, describing it as ""willful indifference for the safety of linguistically diverse communities.""Scurato said she believes there's an ""opportunity"" for Congress to draft regulations that ""require some high levels of transparency when it comes to this kind of content, and how they are enforcing their policies equitably."":"
49,49,116.WasaRussianNuclearEx,"Claim:Vyacheslav Ivanov, a former executive at Rosatom, was killed in a February 2018 plane crash as part of a ""deep state"" plot to cover up corruption by the Clintons.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In February 2018, just after a deadly plane crash in Russia, conspiracy theorists seized on a name among the rosters of those killed to claim that one of them was an executive at Russia's nuclear agency Rosatom; they further speculated that the incident was a CIA operation designed to silence individuals who could provide information that might be damaging to 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. :On 11 February 2018, Saratov Airlines flight 6W703 crashed near Moscow, killing all 71 people on board. Later that day, the meme emerged:Hi, I'm Vyacheslav Ivanov. Today I died in a plane crash in Russia. Oh, and I'm CFO of Rosatom. Uranium One? That part is just a coincidence. :Uranium One is the name of a mining company taken over by Rosatom in 2010, but also shorthand for a debunked conspiracy theory which alleges that Hillary Clinton, acting in her role as Secretary of State, singlehandedly transferred 20 percent of the United States' uranium reserves to Russia, as part of the Rosatom takeover of Uranium One. She did this, according to the conspiracy theory, in exchange for $145 million in donations from Uranium One investors to the Clinton Foundation. (We have previously debunked this.)On 11 February 2018, conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi appeared on the Alex Jones Show on InfoWars, to outline the new plane crash twist in the Uranium One saga:It turns out, on the plane crash there were several executives of Rosatom...One of the top ones was a gentleman named Ivanov, who ended up being the CFO of Rosatom...The suspicions are that it may have been a U.S. intelligence agency CIA hit, to kill these Rosatom executives to prevent them from testifying or being available to give testimony in the beginning enquiries on the whole Uranium One scandal, which I'm predicting will be the end of Robert Mueller's career. :Corsi did not name any executives other than Ivanov. The notorious fake news web site Neon Nettle also got in on the act, claiming the purported death of Vyacheslav Ivanov was proof of a cover-up of Clinton corruption: The ""Deep State"" now seems [to be] scrambling to remove any ""loose ends"" who might testify against the Clintons.The man shown in the meme is Vyacheslav Ivanov, who was chief financial officer of Rosatom until May 2017, according to his LinkedIn profile. There was also someone named Vyacheslav Ivanov killed on Flight 6W703, according to a list of names published by Russia's Ministry for Civil Defense, Emergencies, and Elimination of Consequences of Natural Disasters. However, they are not the same person. Firstly, the man killed on Flight 6W703 (Passenger #32) was born in 1986. In 1987, Rosatom's former chief financial officer Vyacheslav Ivanov began studying for a degree in Computers and Networks at the Moscow Institute of Radioelectronics, according to his LinkedIn profile; either the #QAnon crowd either missed this detail, did some extremely creative math and hoped no one would notice, or Ivanov is a genius the likes of which the world has never seen.:Unfortunately, the ""genius"" theory doesn't hold water, either. The former Rosatom CFO posted photographs of himself to Facebook on 12 February 2018, a day after the crash of Flight 6W703.The false Ivanov conspiracy theory was not the only one that spread online in the aftermath of the crash. Buzzfeed documented right-wing and conspiracy theorist web sites that claimed, also falsely, that Sergei Millian, a Belarussian-American businessman reported to be a source for the dossier at the heart of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign in the months leading up to the 2016 election, was also among the dead.  Russian authorities have not listed anyone by the name Sergei Millian as a passenger of Flight 6W703, and there is no evidence to support claims that Millian uses the alias ""Sergei Panchenko"" -- a name that actually does appear on the official list of passengers.

50,50,525.IsDisneysGoofyCharac,"Claim:The Disney cartoon character Goofy was modeled after a breed of Scottish cow.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Classic Disney cartoons have proved to be a consistent source of conspiracy theories, rumors, and urban legends. For instance, we've previously investigated claims that Winnie the Pooh was actually a girl (Mostly False), that the Seven Dwarfs were modeled on cocaine addiction (False) and that a topless woman could briefly be spotted in VHS copies of ""The Rescuers"" (True).:In January 2019, we encountered yet another Disney rumor: This time, the internet asked, is the Goofy cartoon character actually a cow rather than an (anthropomorphic) dog?Although this dog vs. cow debate wasn't entirely new in 2019, that time around it was supposedly supported by an ""investigative article"" published in 2012 by the website Reel Rundown. While that article did contain some factual information regarding the history of the Goofy character, which is likely the reason why some people have accepted it as a truthful account of Goofy's supposed sordid past, it is peppered with exaggerations, speculation, outright fabrications, and was clearly written with humorous intentions.Reel Rundown presented their argument as if they were uncovering a vast Disney conspiracy theory aimed at covering up Goofy's unsavory bovine heritage. In the introductory section, entitled ""Goofy Is Not a Dog -- The Cover Up,"" the author argued that Goofy was actually a foreign-born cow and that Disney was forced to conceal this fact due to the political climate in the 1930s::Goofy has always been thought of as a ""dog with human features"" according to Disney's Mouselinks. However what the Disney establishment isn't telling you is the goofy is really a cow. To be specific an Aberdeen-Angus Cattle. A fact that Disney would love to cover-up considering that Goofy's national origin is anything but American. In 1939 with American nationalism at an historic high, Goofy's true heritage could have created a huge scandal for Disney. A Scandal that would have finished Goofies [sic] career just as it was starting to take-off.""The next section, ""Goofy's Heritage Revealed,"" was even more outlandish. Reel Rundown imagined Goofy as a living, breathing, physical animal who was born ""Dipalwa Dawala"" to Egyptian immigrants in Scotland and was ""discovered by Disney talent scouts during a livestock sale."" During the ""Dark Years"" section of the article, the website upped the absurdity and claimed that Goofy's son died from Mad Cow disease.For those who took the time to read the article, it should have been obvious that it was a work of humorous fiction. However, it seems that some readers stopped at the headline and were left convinced that Goofy was actually a cow, not a dog:::Although this article was clearly written in jest, some of its curious claims have been spread in support of the ""Goofy is a cow"" argument. We'll dispel some of this misinformation to stop malicious propagation of rumors about this beloved Disney dog.Was Goofy ""born"" to Egyptian immigrants in Scotland and named ""Dipalwa Dawala?""First off, Goofy wasn't ""born"" anywhere: He was created by Disney animators Art Babbitt and Frank Webb in the 1930s. Goofy was introduced as a side character named ""Dippy Dawg"" in the cartoon short Mickey's Revue (1932) but underwent some revisions over the next few years. While Goofy has gone by a number of names during his Disney career (including Super Goof, Dippy Dawg, George G. Geef, Goofus D. Dawg, and Goofy Goof), we were unable to find any credible source listing the character as ""Dipalwa Dawala.""In fact, the only search results we could find for this term all point back to this Reel Rundown article. In other words, Goofy has never been named ""Dipalw Dawala."":Does Goofy's old love interest, Clarabelle the Cow, prove that Goofy is also a cow?Reel Rundown ended their humorous work of fiction with an ""evidence"" section claiming that Disney's history of creating same species couples (Mickey and Minnie, Donald and Daisy, etc.) pointed to Goofy's being a cow since he once had a love interest named Clarabele Cow:Goofy's love interest in the Mickey Mouse clubhouse is Clarabelle the Cow. The on-screen chemistry is obvious. Disney often couples characters with the opposite sex of the same species. Mickey and Mini, Donald and Daisey [sic] both follow this pattern. So why would the writers at Disney have Goofy and Clarabelle coupled up?While it's true that Goofy and Clarabelle Cow were once an item, this is not proof that they were the same species of animal. Clarabelle was the sometimes girlfriend of Horace Horsecollar, who was a horse and not a cow, and the Disney universe includes multiple examples of inter-species couples: Ben Ali Gator, for instance, woos Hyacinth Hippo in Fantasia; Jessica Rabbit (a cartoon human) has a rabbit husband in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog have an ongoing (if one-sided) relationship in the Muppet canon. Outside the Disney universe, Bimbo, a cartoon dog, was the occasional love interest of Betty Boop (a human female), and of course, Tillie Tiger once planted a kiss on Elmer Elephant::The Reel Rundown article was clearly a jape. However, it made us curious about Goofy's actual origins and whether the character was originally intended to represent a dog.:In Art Babbitt's character analysis of Goofy from 1934 (available via the website of animator Michael Sporn), Goofy is described as a ""composite of an everlasting optimist, a gullible Good Samaritan, a half-wit, a shiftless, good-natured coloured boy and a hick."" In his description of how Goofy should be drawn, Babbit mentioned two real-world creatures, neither of which was a cow:It is true that there is a vague similarity in the construction of the Goof's head and Pluto's. The use of the eyes, mouth and ears are entirely different. One is dog, the other human. The Goof's head can be thought of in terms of a caricature of a person with a pointed dome--large, dreamy eyes, buck teeth and weak chin, a large mouth, a thick lower lip, a fat tongue and a bulbous nose that grows larger on its way out and turns up. His eyes should remain partly closed to help give him a stupid, sloppy appearance, as though he were constantly straining to remain awake, but of course they can open wide for expressions or accents. He blinks quite a bit. His ears for the most part are just trailing appendages and are not used in the same way as Pluto's ears except for rare expressions. His brow is heavy and breaks the circle that outlines his skull.:A description of the character from Disney.go.com also compares Goofy to Pluto but notes that Goofy was created as more of a human character: ""Goofy was created as a human character, as opposed to Pluto, who was a pet, so he walked upright and had a speaking voice.""When we reached out to Disney for comment, a spokesperson told us that both The Disney Animation Research Library and the Walt Disney Archives agreed that Goofy was indeed an anthropomorphic dog. Erin Glover, Director of Publicity and Communications at Disney Animation, told us:The Disney Animation Research Library and the Walt Disney Archives agree that this question was best answered by Disney Legend Dave Smith: ""Goofy was originally created as a human character with dog-like characteristics, thus why he walks upright, wears clothes, talks and has animal features that resemble a dog."" :"

The man wearing a backpack in the photograph is Vinay Krishnan, a consultant who helps organize legal support for the progressive activist organization Center for Popular Democracy (an organization that has been heavily involved in organizing protests against Kavanaugh's confirmation).Krishnan told us the money was raised via small donations from around the country, and protesters were given about $35 to pay related fees in the event they were arrested; if they weren't arrested, the money was to be returned.""These protesters are coming from across the country believing they are fighting for their very right to exist in this country,"" he told us. ""That's why they're there. Not for $35 which they returned immediately if they didn't give it to D.C. Capitol Police.""Both Lampron and Krishnan faced online harassment as a result of the misinformation spread online about them. Krishnan received racially-tinged death threats, forcing him to close down his social media accounts, and a laundromat that had offered Lampron a job reportedly rescinded the offer as a result of the controversy.:Vickie Lampron declined to be interviewed for this story, so we spoke instead to Shay Totten, spokesman for the Vermont activist organization Rights and Democracy, of which Lampron is a member. Totten told us:Vickie is not a paid protester. She felt very strongly that she wanted to go to D.C. on behalf of herself and her granddaughters because she feared she was seeing women's rights on the line when it came to this Supreme Court nomination. We fundraised to send our members down so they don't have to pay out of pocket. But they don't make any money.Adam Schindler's tweets and video were picked up and widely shared by a large number of social media users and junk news sites, including the Gateway Pundit (which incorrectly referred to Schindler as a ""reporter""), Your News Wire, and conspiracy trolling site Infowars.RealClearPolitics meanwhile ran with the headline ""Three Texas Doctors: We Saw Protesters Paid in Cash to Disrupt Brett Kavanaugh Hearing on Line to Enter."" (We reached out to both Schindler and RealClearPolitics publisher Tom Bevan about their posts but received no response.):The images of a ""paid protester"" have popped up repeatedly since the 4 September hearing in the service of false claims that Kavanaugh's confirmation process was being picketed for profit instead of principle.A detail that many junk sites failed to pick up on was that the same day Schindler published his posts claiming to have witnessed the paying of protesters, he began walking those same claims back:Spoke to the protest organizer. She confirmed handing out cash, but said they intend cash to be used to pay fines they know come when protestors break the law. A small price to pay to be ""heard"" I suppose. #KavanaughConfirmation-- Adam W. Schindler (@AdamSchindler) September 5, 2018On 6 September 2018, Schindler authored a blog post recounting his discussion with organizers from the activist group::I went back to the public ticket line mid-afternoon and approached the gentleman from the photos. I greeted him and the moment he saw me he hurried away. A woman sitting on the bench saw this and stepped in. She identified herself as Jennifer (Flynn Walker), the protest organizer from a group called Center for Popular Democracy. We had a very civil discussion about what they were doing and why.I made an audio recording of this conversation and it is posted in its entirety below. I have also transcribed some key moments in the conversation and posted them below.During our 12 minute discussion, a half dozen protestors gathered around and some participated. The gentleman in the photos did not. The protest leader confirmed her group was providing cash to protestors. She took issue with my use of the term ""payment"", saying the provided cash was only to be used to pay the fines. I was unclear how she was able to enforce this vital distinction for her. But nonetheless, she, and the half dozen members surrounding us, all confirmed her group was giving cash to protestors.She then asked if I was interested in knowing the source of her cash. She had good instincts! I didn't even have to ask. I could sense her pride as she told an emotional story about how it was crowdsourced from donors across the nation. I asked if that was the only source of funding for this protest. I had no reason to doubt the truthfulness of her story. But I did doubt it was the only source of funds. She was quick to ask a clarifying question before answering, as her organization is funded with tens of millions of dollars from George Soros. A fact I'm sure she was familiar with. But she said very precisely, ""That's how we pay for the fines, yes."" And that was that.:Billionaire philanthropist George Soros contributes large sums of money toward progressive causes (the Center for Popular Democracy does receive funding from Soros, for example). He is also the boogeyman in many right-wing conspiracy theories that often veer into anti-Semitism, in which he is typically portrayed as a puppet master orchestrating a vague world take-over.We found no evidence, however, to support the claim that Soros was directly paying out money to Kavanaugh hearing protesters, nor did we find evidence to support accusations that persons demonstrating at the hearings were there because they were being paid to protest."

On the same day, conspiracy site whatdoesitmean.com reported that hacker Marcel Lazar Lehel (whose online moniker is ""Guccifer') had gone missing from his Virginia jail cell.Lehel has made headlines for breaking into the emails of a number of high-level authorities in the United States and his native Romania. He has also claimed that he hacked into Hillary Clinton's and the Democratic National Committee's e-mail servers.:The former taxi driver is currently awaiting sentencing in the United States on charges related to hacking into private AOL accounts:An astounding Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that the Romanian hacker Marcel Lehel Lazar (known as Guccifer), who successfully gained access to all of the private and government emails of Hillary Clinton, was discovered missing yesterday by agents from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) who were sent to interview him at the US jail he was supposed to be in--and his whereabouts are still unknown.The claim didn't get very much traction until 5 July 2016, when FBI Director James Comey announced that the Bureau would not be pursuing charges against Hillary Clinton. That announcement kindled interest in the earlier report that  Guccifer had mysteriously disappeared from his jail cell ahead of an FBI interrogation.Rumors that Lazar had disappeared from (or died in) custody are false and were refuted in a statement from the City of Alexandria Sheriff::Marcel Lehel Lazar, a federal inmate also known as Guccifer, is at the William G. Truesdale Adult Detention Center in Alexandria, Va. He is alive and has never been missing from this facility.The rumor of Guccifer's disappearance originated with a single source: the blogger known by the pen name ""Sorcha Faal"" of the political conspiracy site whatdoesitmean.com. RationalWiki describes that site outlet as ""sensational"" and ""outrageous"":Sorcha Faal is the alleged author of an ongoing series of ""reports"" published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don't think much of it.Each report resembles a news story in its style but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don't contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish.:The fabricated whatdoesitmean.com story about Guccifer's disappearance was picked up a few days later by the Christian Times Newspaper web site, which embellished it into a tale of Lazar's in-custody death.  But the Christian Times Newspaper is just another online fake news outlet (not to be confused with the legitimate Christian Times newspaper) that spins fabricated tales for profit.We contacted authorities at the Virginia jail, who were able to confirm that Lehel is alive, well, and in custody there. There is no truth to the claim he went mysteriously missing from his jail cell in early July 2016. "
53,53,40.YesAstronautBuzzAldr,"Claim:Moonwalking astronaut Buzz Aldrin punched a moon-landing-denier conspiracy theorist.Rating:TrueAbout this rating It was the right hook heard round the world.In July 1969, Buzz Aldrin was part of the Apollo 11 crew that first landed on the moon, where he and Neil Armstrong made history as the first humans to set foot on it.:In September 2002, Aldrin, then aged 72, landed a punch on conspiracy theorist Bart Sibrel, who laboring under the false belief that the moon landings were staged, was busy confronting and insulting the legendary astronaut when it happened.The incident occurred outside a hotel in Beverly Hills, California, and was captured on video by Sibrel's crew. Sibrel had been attempting to make a documentary film proving the moon landings were fake, according to news reports at the time.Aldrin can be heard exclaiming, ""Will you get away from me?"" while Sibrel, standing close to him, continues, ""You're a coward and a liar and a thief,"" when Aldrin's punch lands with a thud.The resulting video of the incident probably had the opposite effect that Sibrel was looking for.Police declined to charge Aldrin after witnesses came forward stating that Sibrel had physically provoked him by poking him with a Bible and demanding the 72-year-old swear he really did go to the moon. Additionally, Aldrin had stated he was acting in self-defense and in defense of his stepdaughter, who was accompanying him.:Witnesses also stated that Sibrel had not only lured Aldrin to the hotel under false pretenses, but that he had repeated harassed Aldrin and other Apollo astronauts over the years.Not only was Aldrin not charged, but the video garnered praise for Aldrin, who was seen not only as effectively defending himself but also as delivering poetic justice to a corrosive, nonsensical conspiracy theory.In July 2021, the video was posted on the social media platform Reddit, where it was again widely viewed, and where Reddit users reveled in the moment.""Can you imagine going to the moon and then when you get back having some of the stupidest people on earth telling you it's all fake,"" one Reddit commenter opined.:The Reddit video above even contains the punch in slow-motion."
54,54,657.DidDHSSecretlyWaterm,"Claim:The U.S. Department of Homeland Security orchestrated a sting against Democrats by adding a secret watermark to prove their participation in election fraud.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.In the uncertain days following the 2020 U.S. presidential election, a fantasy pushed by QAnon personalities and die-hard supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump went viral. In broad brushstrokes, the idea was that Democrats would soon be exposed in a massive voter-fraud sting operation orchestrated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The basic premise is that Democrats, in an effort to steal the election in favor of their party's nominee, Joe Biden, printed extra ballots. But, the claim goes, Trump's DHS anticipated this and added a secret watermark to the ballots, making it easy to identify the fraudulent ballots.:""The DEMS fell right into the trap of this sting operation and President Trump has it all,"" a viral bit of Facebook copypasta asserted. ""Fraud will be exposed for the world to see.""As with most conspiracy theories, there are myriad variations on this broad claim, each with its own purported evidence. These variations, both tedious and irrelevant, generally concern the type of watermark used, and the presence or absence of some sort of blockchain-based security. Going into each of these different claims is unnecessary, as all versions of the claim hold that the ruse was possible because the federal government controls the production of ballots. This is, emphatically, not the case.In fact, this is left up to the states, each of which has its own regulations to follow. Practically speaking, most elections are administered at the county level, where they are run either by a board of electors, an election official or officials, or both. This means there are, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than more than 10,000 unique election administration jurisdictions in the U.S., each of which with their own balloting procedures. The large conspiracy alleged here would necessarily involve infiltrating thousands of different election boards or jurisdictions.:The federal government is not responsible for printing or auditing the ballots, either. In most cases, private companies contracted by those local election boards to do the printing. DHS has explicitly stated this in response to these rumors:While DHS and CISA assist states and localities with securing election infrastructure, DHS and CISA [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency] do not design, print, or audit ballots. State and local election officials manage ballot design and printing, as well as the auditing of results.Local election offices have security and detection measures in place that make it highly difficult to commit fraud through counterfeit ballots. While the specific measures vary, in accordance with state and local election laws and practices, ballot security measures can include signature matching, information checks, barcodes, watermarks, and precise paper weights.As such, DHS does not control ""official ballot production,"" nor does any central federal authority have that power. Therefore the central premise behind this QAnon fantasy and its claim of secretly watermarked ballots suffers from a profound ignorance of how American presidential elections actually work. For these reasons, the claim is false.:"
55,55,220.DidPopeFrancisCancel,"Claim:Pope Francis cancelled the Bible and proposed the creation of a new holy book.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 2 April 2018, ThereIsNews.com published an article which appears to report shocking news for the Catholic church -- Pope Francis had ""cancelled"" the Bible, and is proposing the creation of a new holy book:Pope Francis has surprised the world today by announcing that The Bible is totally outdated and needs a radical change, so The Bible is officially canceled and it's announced a meeting between the highest personalities of the church where it will be decided the book that will replace it, its name and its content. Some names are already being considered and the one that has more strength is ""Biblia 2000"".:ThereIsNews.com is a humor web site that solely publishes fictional content, and it carries a disclaimer on the web site that reads as follows:The site ""There is news"" (https://thereisnews.es) (hereinafter referred to as TIN) is a humor site whose purpose is entertainment.The content of TIN is fiction and does not correspond to reality.All references, names, brands or institutions that appear on the site are used as contextual elements, as in any novel or fiction account.The work of fiction may have fooled some readers, as it was published just a few days after several media outlets reported that Pope Francis had denied one of the core tenets of Catholicism -- the existence of hell. That rumor, too, was likely either embellished or misreported.Pope Francis does have somewhat of a history of making controversial statements that are seemingly at odds with traditional church teachings::In politics, they call it going ""off message."" In acting, they call it going ""off script."" In the Catholic Church under Pope Francis, it has become ""business as usual.""Put the 81-year-old pontiff in front of a microphone, and he will make news.Case in point: During a 2015 brief press conference aboard the papal plane from the Philippines to Rome, when Francis sounded off in his very unpope-like way on birth control, corruption and kicking grifters where the sun don't shine.Although this has caused some genuine concern among religious leaders, it has also spawned rumors that the Pope was deliberately trying to undermine the church. This theory was summed up by the conspiracy theorist blog YourNewsWire.com in an article appearing to report that Pope Francis said that his word ""overruled"" anything written in the Bible:Pope Francis has responded to claims that many of his teachings ""contradict Bible teachings"" by saying that his words ""overrule"" anything written in the Bible.The pope has further angered traditional Christians in recent weeks by developing the habit of hiding the crucifix that is worn around his neck when speaking in public, causing many Christians to believe the pontiff is ashamed to display the powerful Christian symbol.:YourNewsWire.com placed the word ""overrule"" in quotes in both their title and opening sentence, but they never provide the actual quote in which Pope Francis allegedly expressed this belief.  It also posted several photographs of the pontiff, using them to claim that he purposefully hides the crucifix on his neck while in public because he is ashamed of the religious symbol:But Pope Francis is so ashamed of our Lord Jesus Christ that he concealed his pectoral cross from Jews by stuffing it into his fascia or waist sash.These photographs, however, appear to show cherry-picked moments when his cross slips behind his clothing. For example, this web site claimed that Pope Francis hid his cross during a kosher luncheon he hosted in January 2014 for a group of rabbis from Argentina. Although the image they provided appears to be genuine (left), other images from this event show the Pope wearing his cross in full view::Likewise, this web site provided three more images which purportedly showed the pope hiding his cross during a visit to Yad Vashem, Israel's memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, in 2014. And although these images all truly show the Pope with his crucifix partially hidden behind his fascia, this is hardly proof that the Pope is ashamed of his religion.He may have been attempting to be culturally sensitive to his Jewish hosts, or, more likely, these were simply momentary (and wholesome) wardrobe malfunctions, as a number of other photographs from the Pope's trip to Yad Vashem show the crucifix on full display: :A video of the Pope's visit to Yad Vashem also shows his cross both in and out of his waistband:The pope never said that he was cancelling the Bible or that his word ""overruled"" what was written in the holy book. Furthermore, the photographs purportedly showing the pope ""hiding"" his cross from view are merely cherry-picked moments from when the crucifix he wears momentarily slipped behind his clothing.:"
56,56,446.DebunkingTrumpTweets,"Claim:Joe Biden won key states in the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to fraudulent late-night ""vote dumps.""Rating:FalseAbout this rating Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.One of the many claims U.S. President Donald Trump and his supporters made in flailing attempts to reverse Trump's defeat by Democratic challenger Joe Biden in the 2020 general election was the assertion that furtive late-night ""dumps"" of illicit ballots had taken place, which wiped out large Trump leads and gave Biden wins in key battleground states::Not only did the ""data dumps"" have nothing fraudulent about them, but they were in fact predictable and had been anticipated well in advance of the election.As we discussed in a separate article, heavy use of mail-in ballots was expected in the election due to the COVID-19 pandemic that made in-person voting risky. Many pre-election discussions noted that the increased use of mail-in ballots could misleadingly skew the early reporting of election results towards one candidate or the other in some states, depending on when those states tabulated their mail-in ballots::Even once the early and in-person ballots are counted, a significant number of votes could still be outstanding. Only nine states expect to have at least 98 percent of unofficial results reported by noon the day after the election.The order in which different types of votes are reported could also make one party look stronger at various points in the night. Democrats are more likely to vote by mail this year, so in states where those will be the first type of ballots released, like Arizona, Florida and North Carolina, initial results could skew in favor of Joseph R. Biden Jr. Places that report in-person Election Day votes first, like most parts of Virginia, will probably look better for President Trump.But the initial skew in a state's results may last only a short while, and it will be influenced by which counties or precincts in the state are the fastest to report ...Moreover, this phenomenon was precisely expected to take place in states that were not allowed (by their own laws) to begin counting mail-in ballots as they were received, but instead had to wait until Election Day or just beforehand -- particularly in the key states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, whose results Trump most vociferously disputed::Voters are casting ballots early in record numbers this year amid the pandemic -- and that's prompting concerns that it might wind up taking longer than expected to get election results, as officials process millions more mail-in ballots than usual.The reality is that most states can begin processing absentee ballots in some form before Election Day, which could help avoid delays in reporting results.But in three critical battleground states -- Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan -- officials aren't allowed to start processing early ballots until on or just before Election Day itself, which could delay not just their state results but also, if the Electoral College count is close, potentially leave the whole presidential race up in the air.The ""vote spikes"" that Trump and his supporters maintain are indicative of election fraud were merely an unsurprising combination of mail-in ballots (which were more heavily used by Democrats) and ballots from areas that vote heavily Democratic. That Trump may have held a lead in early returns reported from these states is irrelevant, akin to claiming that the score at halftime in a football game is more significant than the final result.:In terms of conspiracy theory, this claim runs afoul of some major plot holes, including that:1) It posits that forces working in favor of Democratic candidate Biden were sufficiently powerful, knowledgeable, and widespread to overturn the legitimate election results, yet they couldn't manage to do so in a manner that wasn't clumsy and blatantly obvious.2) It posits that these nefarious operators somehow were able to pull off in 2020 the very thing they had been completely unable to achieve in 2016, when Trump secured the election over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton by winning the very same three states (Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan) by relatively narrow margins."
57,57,618.TheFallacyofMovingth,"Here at Snopes, we encounter our fair share of logical fallacies, or errors in reasoning that tend to be more persuasive than they really are, and are based on poor or faulty logic. In previous coverage, we've looked at a range of fallacies including ad hominem attacks, the black sheep effect, confirmation biases, and more. Now, we're unpacking the concept of ""changing the goalposts"" -- or reworking ""the terms of a debate or conflict after its started,"" according to journalist and editor Peter Stothard, speaking to The New York Times in 1990, to gain an advantage over others.Indeed, changing the rules in the middle of a process has been commonly employed as a form of workplace abuse, as well as a misinformation tactic. Dave Hahn, adjunct professor of philosophy at SUNY Geneseo, described it thus in an article for The Skeptic:The conspiracy theorist posits an epistemic standard that they claim will disabuse them of their position. They say, 'I will no longer believe my theory if you can provide X evidence.""You, the intelligent (and good looking) skeptic reply, ""You mean this evidence? Here you are.""At this point, in an ideal world, this conversation should be over. The conspiracy theorist should shrug and reply, ""Oh, that evidence does exist. I guess I was mistaken, perhaps we should share a tea and have a friendly chuckle about this.""Instead the conspiracy theorist shifts the goalposts. Instead of reconsidering their belief, they ask for X+1. If you provide X+1, it will not matter because they will then ask for X+2, then X+3...and so on. The temptation for us skeptics is to provide the evidence, and if we do, we are falling for their trap, which will be perceived as a 'victory' for their side. :In workplaces, this can take the form of ""raising the bar"" for success, and often facilitates discrimination against women and other marginalized groups. The New York Times detailed a discrimination lawsuit from 1999 that fit this description:When Cornelius Cooper, a lineman at the Georgia Power Company, joined a discrimination lawsuit against his employer last summer, he did not dwell on the company's failure to promote him to a training job.Instead, Mr. Cooper, who is black, complained that Georgia Power kept raising the bar. In 1992, for example, when he was working on underground power lines, he was denied a promotion because he lacked sufficient experience working with overhead lines, he said in court papers. Even though he disagreed, he spent nearly a year working on overhead lines to get the job, he said, only to be told that he did not have enough experience with underground lines.In numerous cases of discrimination against Black employees, lawyers pointed out that employers were moving the goalposts: ""They [workers] are told they cannot advance to a coveted job until they acquire a particular skill, like obtaining a college degree or learning how to use new software. Then, when they achieve that goal, the employer sets another requirement and the promotion sails even farther out of reach."" :How does this play out in politics? Political comedy show ""The Daily Show"" made this argument about former U.S. President Donald Trump in his response to the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, saying he moved the goalposts on his predictions for how many people would die from the virus as death tolls rose. In a series of clips taken from different speeches, Trump's initial forecasts for the number of COVID-19 deaths shifted considerably from 60,000 to 200,000 as he was proven wrong by the increasing number of fatalities. In order to spin the government's handling of the pandemic as a success story, his standards evolved.:U.S. President Joe Biden similarly had shifting goalposts when it came to reopening schools from COVID lockdowns; that is, moving students from online-only to in-person learning. In February 2021, his press secretary stated that, by day 100 of his presidency (April 30, 2021), the administration would like most schools to have at least one in-person day each week.""[That's] the bar of where we'd like the majority of schools across the country to be, which they're not at this point in time, and we want to build from there.""A week later, after some people criticized the administration for not taking bigger strides to get students back to in-person classes, Biden denied that his administration thought that one day a week was enough and told a town-hall audience his goal was five days of classroom instruction, and, ""I think we'll be close to that at the end of the first 100 days."" The next day, his press secretary added that the one-day-a-week policy ""was our floor, it was not our ceiling."" Check out more explanations of logical fallacies here and here. "

""It is a man-made virus created in the lab based on the China ... the very unique bat coronavirus, which cannot affect people, but after the modification becomes a very harmful virus.""Yan did claim that SARS-CoV-2 was made in a lab, but the suggestion is false, misleading, and based on a non-peer-reviewed report that was published in two separate studies on Sept. 14 and Oct. 8 in the preprint server Zenodo, which means that the research had not gone through rigorous editorial critically evaluated by scientific experts with an extra degree of scrutiny. Research that has not been peer-reviewed is akin to a blog -- anyone can publish one online with little expertise. A reviewed study, on the other hand, is on par with a well-vetted, expertly researched textbook. To facilitate the quick spread of new scientific information in the midst of the pandemic, prepublication research has become more common in order to facilitate the quick dissemination of important information, particularly as peer-reviewed research can take a long time to publish.:Despite its erroneous claims, the study had been downloaded more than half of a million times and received more than 700,000 views as of this writing.A History of Contentious Origin ClaimsSince SARS-CoV-2 was first discovered in January 2020 and subsequently declared a pandemic the following month, conspiracy theorists have peddled notions that the virus was made in a lab and intentionally released as a biological weapon despite rigorous scientific research proving otherwise. According to one expert: ""This particular conspiracy around deliberate release form a laboratory has been doing the rounds throughout the pandemic. It has been rebutted several times already. Ultimately, it could be damaging to public health if reported uncritically without looking at the wider evidence. If people are exposed to and then believe conspiracy theories, this will likely have a negative impact on efforts to keep COVID-19 cases low and thus there will be more death and illness than there needs to be,"" said Dr. Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, in a statement.:And Yan's account of the origins of the virus is no different. The controversial doctor first made headlines in July 2020 when she told Fox News in an exclusive interview that she believed the Chinese government failed to tell the world about the virus' origins at its onset, ignoring her research and potentially putting lives at risk. At the time, Hong Kong University (HKU) issued a news release confirming that Yan had previously been affiliated as a post-doctoral fellow but that she had since left the institution. The news release continued:While HKU respects freedom of expression, Dr Yan's past or present opinions and views do not represent those of the University.HKU notes that the content of the said news report does not accord with the key facts as we understand them. Specifically, Dr Yan never conducted any research on human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus at HKU during December 2019 and January 2020, her central assertion of the said interview.We further observe that what she might have emphasized in the reported interview has no scientific basis but resembles hearsay.HKU does not act on hearsay and we will not further comment on this matter.:Snopes contacted HKU for further comment but did not receive a response at the time of publication. Emails sent from our team to the address listed on Yan's report also went unanswered.In a September 2020 interview with the hosts of the British talk show ""Loose Women,"" Yan claimed that she had been chosen to do a ""secret investigation"" while studying a cluster of SARS-related viruses in December 2019 when she found out that the Chinese government was manufacturing a virus to use as a bioweapon. After confronting her supervisor, she claimed, she was allegedly forced to flee to the U.S. for her own safety. The story was reiterated in an interview with Tucker Carlson the following day when she directly blamed the Chinese Communist Party for manufacturing the virus.In less than a week after airing, the interview had been viewed more than 2.2 million times. :Several media publications reported that Yan's Twitter account was suspended as of Sept. 21, 2020. The first known mention of the suspension was on Tucker Carlson Tonight, however, Twitter declined to comment on the alleged suspension in an email sent to Snopes, and the platform did not flag the virologist's interview. A video of the interview is also still available on Facebook and Instagram, however, both platforms flagged the video for its misleading content.Funding Ties to the Rule of Law Society:The report was primarily authored by Yan and three other researchers who listed an affiliation with the Rule of Law Society on the cover page. The society is a political organization -- not a research institution -- that was founded by exiled Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui, who fled China in 2014 in advance of corruption charges, and Steve Bannon, an American businessman and political strategist who previously oversaw the far-right publication Breitbart News, and was recently arrested in connection to the ""We Build The Wall"" fraud scam.Dr. Andrew Preston, a biologist at the University of Bath, highlighted in a statement that the authors' affiliation with a politically based organization rather than with a research institution was a conflict of interest and added that the ""preprint report cannot be given any credibility in its current form,"" given its unsubstantiated claims that have not been peer-reviewed.""The report is not based on an objective interpretation of the SARS-CoV2 genome. The interpretations made are not supported by data, are unsubstantiated and the interpretations are largely stated but not explained,"" Preston said. The scientists continued that the report does not appear to start with an open hypothesis about the origin of SARS-CoV2. The language of the report is reminiscent of a conspiracy theory."":Yan's primary argument is that the genetic structure of SARS-CoV-2 provided evidence that the virus was manufactured by researchers with the Chinese Communist Party by targeting select parts of the viral genome, a feat that would be nearly impossible, said Craig Wilen, assistant professor of laboratory medicine and immunology at the Yale School of Medicine, in an interview with Snopes. But first, it's important to understand how a virus is sequenced and what researchers know about SARS-CoV-2.How to Sequence a VirusWhen a new virus is discovered, scientists around the world will work as quickly as possible to create a genetic map by sequencing every genome held within the virus. At the onset of the 2020 pandemic, researchers quickly transcribed the genetic makeup of the virus and uploaded what was known about the 30,000 base-pair genomes into a global database for future study. When mapped, the virus was found to contain roughly 30,000 nucleotides, which form the basis of each structural unit of DNA.:Once a map of the base pair is determined, synthesizing a virus in a lab is not unheard of. In fact, many commercial companies hold repositories of ""chunks"" of genomic material, but in order to manufacture a virus such as SARS-CoV-2, a scientist would need to take the 30,000 base-pair genome, make that into ribonucleic acid (RNA), and then turn that RNA into a virus. Wilen said that expert virology labs could, in theory, manipulate SARS-CoV, the virus responsible for the 2002 SARS pandemic, or MERS-CoV, the virus that caused the 2014 MERS pandemic, to hypothetically manufacture a new virus, but would first need to know what each of those individual nucleotides is responsible for, and how to manipulate them to become harmful and infectious to humans -- an enormous feat that is beyond the scope of many viral labs and research.""Being off by one could destroy the entire virus. As much as the world has studied this virus now, we have no idea what properties those 30,000 base pairs, which of those are important for infection, which of those make it spread asymptomatically, which of those cause disease,"" Wilen said. ""So, we are totally ignorant in terms of the biology in terms of being able to come up with the sequence de novo to then make it."":Wilen likened the manufacturing of a virus to taking one of Shakespeare's sonnets, determining how many words it contains, then chopping up a dictionary and subsequently trying to build a sonnet from those chopped-up words.""Yes, you would get something that is the right length of a sonnet, but almost certainly it's going to be incoherent and not useful,"" he said.Evolutionary Processes Exhibited in the Coronavirus FamilyIn her report, Yan argued that two strains of bat coronavirus were shown to be 89% similar to SARS-CoV-2, which seems at first glance to be quite a bit. Coronaviruses are a large family of closely related viruses that naturally circulate in a number of different species, including bats, camels, pangolins, and rodents. A huge amount of genetic diversity of coronaviruses occurs naturally in the environment, and when it comes to human pandemic coronaviruses, all three have exhibited cross-species transmission from a nonhuman host.:In actuality, 89% of genetic similarity is very low. Previous research found that the human genome is almost 99% identical to chimpanzees and bonobos, yet there are very obvious differences between the two species. In terms of Yan's genetic mapping, 89% would suggest that there are roughly 3,300 nucleotides not shared between the two viruses and, if SARS-CoV-2 was manufactured in a lab, researchers would have had to pinpoint the cause and effect of each of those nucleotides in order to make it both infectious and harmful to humans.Yan further argued that SARS-CoV-2 is like ""Frankenstein,"" if the beast were a cow with a ""deer's head, rabbit ears, and also has monkey's hands,"" which in her logic, suggested that the virus cannot be natural. Wilen said that although this comparison was hyperbolic, it's not necessarily incorrect -- viruses undergo several evolutionary changes throughout their short life cycle, but that doesn't mean that they were manufactured in a lab. Coronaviruses' ability to evolve from animal to human transmission is due, in part, to its unique life cycle. Viruses tend to have a 12-hour life cycle while humans, on the other hand, have an average life expectancy of 79 years. Because of this quick lifespan, viruses undergo rapid evolutionary changes in an incredibly short amount of time.:Coronaviruses can mutate in two ways, the first of which occurs during replication. Viruses are capable of replicating once they have infected a host, and it is through that replication process that an error can sometimes occur, and one of the tens-of-thousands of nucleotides may mutate. This mutation can change the function of a particular protein, and though such errors are often harmless or have no physical consequence to the virus, sometimes a mutation can result in the virus being unable to replicate or lose its infectiousness. The other way coronaviruses can mutate is through a process known as genetic recombination. This occurs when viruses of two different, but closely related, strains simultaneously infect the same host cell and interact while they are replicating to create a viral progeny (new virus) from two ""parent viruses"" that contains genes from both. Recombination is seen in other viruses and happens often. A study published in the April 2020 issue of the scientific journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution found that the SARS-CoV-2 genome can be more than 95% similar to another coronavirus (RaTG3) that was isolated from bats, while a study published in Nature in March found that pangolin coronavirus genomes were between 85.5% and 92.4% similar. Ironically, the similarities between multiple coronavirus samples taken from the wild and SARS-CoV-2 actually argue in favor of natural evolution by way of recombination.:""In the wild, these viruses are circulated all over the place. Animals are getting infected with multiple coronaviruses that are genetically similar, and that facilitates this recombination happening in the wild. It's easy to make it happen in the lab, but it absolutely happens in the wild. This is a good way to make big, functional changes in viruses,"" Wilen said."
59,59,290.LeakedEmailShowsClin,"Claim:A leaked Clinton Foundation e-mail demonstrates collusion between the organization and media personality John Oliver.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 7 October 2016, various conspiracy theory web sites posted articles alleging that a hacked e-mail from the personal account of a former Hillary Clinton employee at the U.S. State Department, Capricia Penavic Marshall, suggested ""some level of collusion"" between the Clintons, HBO, and British-born comedian and television host John Oliver::As presenter of the popular HBO show Last Week Tonight, Oliver has made a name for himself with a series of anti-Donald Trump monologues, including one that made global headlines when he revealed that the Trump family name was once changed from the ancestral name ""Drumpf"".The email was sent on February 19, 2015 by Greg Propper, an advisor to The Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. Its recipients included Sarah Henning, Director of Programs at the Clinton Foundation, and Capricia Marshal, who served as served as chief of protocol from 2009 to 2013 under Secretary Clinton at the State Department.The email, which was sent to Henning's 'clintonfoundation.org' address, is entitled, ""We've made contact with John Olivier"" and the body of the email reads, ""And his team is working on it. Hope to have an answer tomorrow.""While acknowledging that the spelling of Oliver's name is off by one character -- ""We've made contact with John Olivier,"" the e-mail reads -- InfoWars goes on to claim that ""the context makes it clear that the email is in reference to the comedian."" That's patently false, however, considering that the entire message consists of 20 words:::We are unable to explain why InfoWars wanted to convince us that the e-mail provides enough context to conclude that ""John Olivier"" is ""John Oliver"" -- unless it's because they don't want us poking around and finding out there are more e-mails in the exchange that not only establish the context, but also prove that the Clinton associates reached out to Oliver for a perfectly above-board reason: to invite him to make a guest appearance at a March 9, 2015 event being planned in conjunction with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.In fact, Oliver was but one of a long list of celebrities under consideration::Apropos of John Oliver, the idea was apparently to have him open the show with a short comedy sketch. From the looks of it, they were trying to get singer John Legend to entertain, as well::Neither Oliver nor Legend ended up performing in the show. We scanned the leaked e-mails for further evidence of conspiracy, but found none -- unless you count the idea of staging a surprise truce between ""feuding"" pop stars Katy Perry and Taylor Swift, an event that (like Oliver's appearance) also never came to pass."
60,60,120.WasSeanHannityOuteda,"On 16 April 2018, a court hearing relating to a federal criminal investigation of President Donald Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen took an unexpected twist when it emerged that Fox News host and frequent conspiracy theory cheerleader Sean Hannity was one of his clients.Predictably, perhaps, news of Hannity's relationship with Trump's embattled lawyer prompted conspiracy trolls to spread baseless stories that Hannity had been outed by the ""deep state."" However, Hannity's name had been revealed as the result of a judge's order after federal prosecutors argued that the identity of an anonymous Cohen client (Hannity) should be made known for the sake of transparency.The news came after Hannity had for days railed against a Federal Bureau of Investigation raid on Cohen's office, home and hotel room in execution of search warrants the previous week. Hannity did not disclose to his audience that Cohen was also his attorney. In a statement, Hannity said:Michael Cohen has never represented me in any matter. I never retained him, received an invoice, or paid legal fees. I have occasionally had brief discussions with him about legal questions about which I wanted his input and perspective.[...]In response to some wild speculation, let me make clear that I did not ask Michael Cohen to bring this proceeding on my behalf, I have no personal interest in this proceeding, and, in fact, asked that my de minimis discussions with Michael Cohen, which dealt almost exclusively about real estate, not be made a part of this proceeding.:Hannity frequently traffics the ""deep state"" conspiracy theory on his show and on social media, and Internet hucksters quickly picked up the trail, producing a stream of baseless stories that spread, as usual, via disreputable web sites and social media trolls.For example, TheGatewayPundit.com, an unreliable site currently being sued for defamation after accusing an innocent person of being the suspect accused of killing a counter-protester at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville in August 2017, published a story with the extraordinarily misleading headline, ""BREAKING: Sean Hannity Responds After Deep State Alleges He Was Michael Cohen's 3rd Client.""Alt-right Twitter troll Jack Posobiec drew on another tired conspiracy theory to insinuate that billionaire philanthropist George Soros pulled the strings, causing the judge to identify Hannity as one of Cohen's clients:The judge who ordered Sean Hannity's name outed performed George Soros' wedding pic.twitter.com/33evQeRCZ0-- Jack Posobiec (@JackPosobiec) April 16, 2018:Unsurprisingly, Alex Jones's conspiracy network InfoWars quickly followed suit with paranoid reporting that conflated two unrelated events: In 2013, Judge Kimba Wood officiated Soros's wedding. Five years later, she presided over the Cohen hearing in which Hannity was named as his client. This was presented as shadowy malfeasance by Jones and his ilk who apparently believe Soros is an all-powerful puppeteer who, despite every indication to the contrary, controls the world:The U.S. District judge who ordered Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen to identify Sean Hannity had officiated billionaire George Soros' wedding in 2013.Judge Kimba Wood officiated the ""non-denominational"" wedding between Soros and his third wife Tamiko Bolton in 2013 in Bedford, New York.Suddenly, Wood's decision to force Cohen to disclose his clients becomes clear.Jared Holt, a writer for Right Wing Watch -- a web site operated by the liberal advocacy nonprofit group People for the American Way, which tracks and monitors right-wing extremist rhetoric -- told us the ""deep state"" theme was ready-made for the news about Hannity::Every single night on Sean Hannity's program there's some kind of talk about the deep state in one form or another. It's used as a sort of bludgeon to discredit any federal investigation into the goings on of Trump's campaign and his associates. It was almost a natural fit that the deep state conspiracy theories that he s putting forward eventually got applied to his own case. I guess it's not incredibly surprising, but it truly came full circle.The ""deep state"" conspiracy theory posits that the hand of a ""shadow government"" controls all, and that it is mounting a campaign to oust President Trump and undo his supporters; it is often promoted by Trump himself. (There is no clear reason given that an authoritarian, murderous ""shadow government"" would allow a select few to continue talking about its existence on public airwaves that potentially reach millions of viewers or listeners, but no one ever seems to ask.)According to whistleblower Christopher Wylie, the phrase ""deep state"" was tested by scandal-plagued psychographics firm Cambridge Analytica on Facebook users to gauge their reaction without their knowledge or consent.:Many of the personalities latching on to this most recent claim also went to the mat for other outlandish ideas, including the inexplicably prominent PizzaGate yarn that held Trump's 2016 rival Hillary Clinton was involved in a pedophile ring run out of the basement a Washington, D.C. pizzeria (the restaurant has no basement).For his part, Hannity was one of the most vocal proponents of the baseless claim that Seth Rich, a murdered Democratic National Committee staffer, had stolen Clinton's emails in the days leading up to the election instead of Russian hackers. Rich's family is now suing Fox News over the botched reporting of that story and its aftermath."
61,61,68.SaturdayNightSkive,"Claim:   Saturday Night Live (SNL) aired a ""Conspiracy Theory Rock!"" segment once in 1998, after which it was banned by the network.   MOSTLY FALSE:WHAT'S TRUE:   A 1998 episode of SNL included a ""Schoolhouse Rock!"" parody segment called ""Conspiracy Theory Rock!"" that was dropped from subsequent reruns of the episode.     WHAT'S FALSE:   The ""Conspiracy Theory Rock!"" segment was banned or suppressed by the network because its anti-corporate message was deemed too dangerous, offensive to sponsors, or otherwise unflattering to various corporations.Example:     [Collected via Facebook, September 2015]This was actually shown on Saturday Night Live in 1998 -- just one time. It was then pulled from future syndication of SNL. Wonder why? Hmmm ...Posted by Brandon Weber on Friday, September 11, 2015Origins:    On 11 September 2015, Upworthy contributor Brandon Weber posted the video shown above, a segment from a 1998 episode of Saturday Night Live, a conspiracy theory-like segment (done in a video style imitative of the popular ""Schoolhouse Rock!"" series of animated educational shorts= films) that posited a phenomenon of large corporations gaining increasing control of the news (and other informational) media and using their hegemony to control what the public sees and hears -- usually to the benefit of the corporation and the detriment of consumers.  Weber's post stated that the segment had aired only once (during the SNL episode's original network broadcast) and then had been excised from syndicated repeats of the episode, suggesting that the corporate powers-that-be had wielded their influence to clamp down on furthers airing of such an unflattering (and possibly true) portrayal.:This September 2015 Facebook post clearly made quite an impression on fellow social media users, but it also  oversimplified the story behind the ""Conspiracy Theory Rock!"" segment and later airings of it.  The rumor that the segment had since been ""suppressed"" was expressed at least as far back as 18 June 1998, when a New York Daily News article titled ""'SNL' Kills Controversial Cartoon Spoof"" reported that:Alert viewers will notice something missing from this weekend's ""Saturday Night Live,"" a repeat of a March broadcast hosted by actress Julianne Moore: the ""TV Funhouse"" animated segment that aired in the original show. The slyly lighthearted piece titled ""Conspiracy Theory Rock"" and produced in the style of PBS' ""Schoolhouse Rock"" kids' show actually was a sophisticated satire of the increasing concentration of media ownership in a small number of huge multi-national corporations. It included references to Disney/ABC, CBS and NBC and its parent company, General Electric. ""SNL"" executive producer Lorne Michaels said he decided to pull the segment because ""I didn't think it worked comedically.""Michaels said he was not concerned at all about the references to NBC and General Electric, and that a passing dig at NBC West Coast executive Don Ohlmeyer for firing former ""SNL"" cast member Norm Macdonald is now dated. ""The test was putting it on live,"" Michaels said. ""If we hadn't aired it originally, we would have been accused of bowing to corporate pressure and censorship and all that. I wanted to support [writer/producer] Robert [Smigel] in what he wanted to do creatively, so I put it on the air."":The article additionally stated that Michaels had said ""editing elements out of shows before they're rerun isn't common but is certainly not unprecedented,"" and a 23 April 2006 New York Times profile of Robert Smigel (a longtime SNL contributor and creator of ""Saturday TV Funhouse,"" the recurring segment of which ""Conspiracy Theory Rock!"" was a part) contained a portion that reported Michaels had opted to cut the segment from the episode to make room for other material:Then there is the matter of a short called ""Conspiracy Theory Rock,"" a parody of the ABC educational cartoon ""Schoolhouse Rock,"" which begins as a bright, sing-along indictment of media consolidation, and ends by criticizing NBC's news division for ignoring the misdeeds of General Electric, the network's parent company. Since making its debut on the March 14, 1998, episode of ""SNL,"" ""Conspiracy Theory Rock"" has not been rebroadcast.""It just struck me as really funny to do it on our own network,"" he said. ""I was somewhat delighted that they were O.K. to do that, and then they reconsidered. It's hard to get angry about it.""Mr. Michaels said that ""Conspiracy Theory Rock"" had simply been cut from reruns to make room for a second performance from the episode's musical guests, the Backstreet Boys. When ""Saturday TV Funhouse"" is not stirring up controversy, it allows Mr. Smigel to express ideas that perhaps no other venue could accommodate. :While the 2006 New York Times article didn't state that ""Conspiracy Theory Rock!"" had been ""banned,"" it did indicate that at that time the segment had never been rebroadcast. In January 2012 , a Huffington Post article reported that Michaels had said the ""Conspiracy Theory Rock!"" clip ""wasn't funny"" and therefore was rarely included in subsequent airings of the show (although the article provided no citation for that statement) but noted that the clip had been available in a ""Saturday TV Funhouse"" DVD compilation since 2006:It aired once with the original ""SNL"" episode, and was pulled from syndication because it ""wasn't funny,"" according to ""SNL"" creator and producer Lorne Michaels, but it got a lot of attention when comedian Marc Maron tweeted a link to the video.The cartoon has since gone viral as a ""banned"" clip, but according to J.J. Sedelmaier, who created ""Funhouse"" along with Robert Smigel for ""The Dana Carvey Show,"" the clip was ""unavailable for viewing (separate from our studio's reel) for quite some time,"" but did, however, eventually end up being ""included in the ""Saturday TV Funhouse"" DVD compilation that was released in 2006,"" which is probably where the video being passed around online was ripped from.:So although it's true that ""Conspiracy Theory Rock"" was largely elided from subsequent SNL broadcasts of the episode in which it originally appeared, no available evidence supports the notion that the clip was formally banned by any particular interests rather than, as producer Lorne Michaels stated, it was trimmed due to run-time restrictions and his judgment that the material was dated and didn't come across as funny.It's also the case that if NBC and/or the network's corporate parent, General Electric, had considered the ""Conspiracy Theory Rock!"" segment too offensive or potentially troublesome for their tastes, they likely wouldn't have broadcast it in the first place.  While Saturday Night Live's format means the network has somewhat diminished control over what goes out on the air should there be a disparity between the show's scripted material and what gets performed live in the moment, the ""Saturday TV Funhouse"" segments were animated and were therefore necessarily prepared in advance and available for review prior to airtime.In any case, since the 29 April 2006 release of the Saturday Night Live -- The Best of Saturday TV Funhouse DVD included ""Conspiracy Theory Rock!"" among 24 installments of that recurring SNL segment in a package officially released by NBC Universal Television, it's fairly safe to say ""Conspiracy Theory Rock!"" is not now in a state of being ""banned"" or ""suppressed"" by network ownership.:"

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.It's widely believed that social media conspiracy theories are driven by malicious and anonymous ""bots"" set up by shadowy third parties. But my new research - which examined an extremely successful COVID-19 conspiracy theory - has shown that ordinary citizen accounts can be just as culpable when it comes to spreading dangerous lies and misinformation.The pandemic has fuelled at least ten conspiracy theories this year.  Some linked the spread of the disease to the 5G network, leading to phone masts being vandalised. Others argued that COVID-19 was a biological weapon. Research has shown that conspiracy theories could contribute to people ignoring social distancing rules. The #FilmYourHospital movement was one such theory. It encouraged people to record videos of themselves in seemingly empty, or less-than-crowded, hospitals to prove the pandemic is a hoax. Many videos showing empty corridors and wards were shared.:Our research sought to identify the drivers of the conspiracy and examine whether the accounts that propelled it in April 2020 were bots or real people. Scale of the conspiracyThe 5G conspiracy attracted 6,556 Twitter users over the course of a single week. The #FilmYourHospital conspiracy was much larger than 5G, with a total of 22,785 tweets sent over a seven day period by 11,333 users. It also had strong international backing. Graph shows how the conspiracy theory discussion was broken up into different groups.Wasim Ahmed, Author providedThe visualisation above shows each Twitter user as a small circle and the overall discussion is clustered into a number of different groups. These groups are formed based on how users were mentioning and re-tweeting each other.The visualisation highlights how the three largest groups were responsible for spreading the conspiracy the furthest. For instance, the discussion in groups one and two was centred around a single tweet that was highly re-tweeted. The tweet suggested the public were being misled and that hospitals were not busy or overrun - as had been reported by the mainstream media. The tweet then requested other users to film their hospitals using the hashtag so that it could become a trending topic. The graphic shows the reach and size of these groups.:Where are the bots?We used Botometer to detect bots that draw on a machine learning algorithm. The tool calculates a score where low scores indicate human behaviour and a high score indicates a bot. Botometer works by extracting various features from an account such as its profile, friends, social network, patterns in temporal activity, language and sentiment. Our study took a 10% systematic representative sample of users to run through Botometer. Our results indicated that the rate of automated accounts was likely to be low. We used the raw scores from Botometer to attach a probability label of whether the account was likely to be a bot. These ranged from very low, low, low-medium and high probability.At best, only 9.2% of the sample that we looked at resembled highly suspicious account behaviour or bots. That means over 90% of accounts we examined were probably genuine.  :Figure shows how many of the accounts were suspicious or bot-like.Wasim Ahmed, Author providedInterestingly, we also found that deleted accounts and automated accounts contained keywords such as ""Trump"" and ""Make America Great Again"" in their user-bios. Around the same time President Donald Trump had been in disagreement with scientific advisers on when to lift lockdown rules. Where did it come from?When we examined the most influential users connected to the hashtag we found that the conspiracy theory was driven by influential conservative politicians as well as far-right political activists. Scholars have noted how the far right has been exploiting the pandemic. For example, some of have set up channels on Telegram, a cloud-based instant messaging service, to discuss COVID-19 and have amplified disinformation. But once the conspiracy theory began to generate attention it was sustained by ordinary citizens. The campaign also appeared to be supported and driven by pro-Trump Twitter accounts and our research found that some accounts that behaved like ""bots"" and deleted accounts tended to be pro-Trump. It is important to note that not all accounts that behave like bots are bots, as there might be users who are highly active who could receive a high score. And, conversely, not all bots are harmful as some have been set up for legitimate purposes. :Twitter users frequently shared YouTube videos in support of the theory and YouTube was an influential source.Can they be stopped?Social media organisations can monitor for suspicious accounts and content and if they violate the terms of service, the content should be removed quickly. Twitter experimented with attaching warning labels on tweets. This was initially unsuccessful because Twitter accidentally mislabelled some tweets, which might have inadvertently pushed conspiracies further. But if they manage to put together a better labelling technique this could be an effective method. Conspiracies can also be countered by providing trustworthy information, delivered from public health authorities as well as popular culture ""influencers"". For instance, Oldham City Council in the UK, enlisted the help of actor James Buckley - famous for his role as Jay in the E4 sitcom The Inbetweeners - to spread public health messages.:And other research highlights that explaining flawed arguments and describing scientific consensus may help reduce the effect of misinformation.. Sadly, no matter what procedures and steps are put in place, there will always be people who will believe in conspiracies. The onus must be on the platforms to make sure these theories are not so easily spread.:Wasim Ahmed, Lecturer in Digital Business, Newcastle UniversityThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

The post included photographs of packed asbestos material adorned with the face of Trump and the text ""Approved by Donald Trump, 45th President of the United States."":Asbestos is a mineral that was once widely used in construction projects for its fire resistant properties, but research has since linked it to a variety of cancers, most notably lung cancer and mesothelioma. :The non-profit health and environmental protection Environmental Working Group, who first called attention to the Uralasbest post, provided an English translation of the text that was shared alongside the image: ""Donald is on our side! ... He supported the head of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, who stated that his agency would no longer deal with negative effects potentially derived from products containing asbestos. Donald Trump supported a specialist and called asbestos '100% safe after application.'""These images, as they were posted to the official social media accounts of Uralasbest, are genuine. Also genuine is President Trump's support of the asbestos industry. Trump once opined, in his 1997 book The Art of the Comeback, that efforts to reduce and regulate asbestos (a material he claimed was ""100% safe"" once applied) in building construction were part of a mob-led conspiracy: ""I believe that the movement against asbestos was led by the mob, because it was often mob-related companies that would do the asbestos removal. Great pressure was put on politicians, and as usual, the politicians relented.""In June, when Uralasbest posted their message of support, then-Administrator of the EPA Scott Pruitt had recently announced new interpretations of the Toxic Substances Control Act that could allow for ""new uses"" of asbestos to be approved in the United States. While this move would not allow for previously banned uses to be considered, it was a reversal of Obama-era rules that barred the EPA from considering any new uses for asbestos.:"
64,64,156.COVID19WhytheLabLeak,"This article about COVID-19 origins is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.A year and a half into the pandemic, we still do not know exactly where the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, came from. The prevailing view so far has been that the virus ""spilled over"" from bats into humans. But there are increasing calls to investigate the possibility that it emerged from a lab in Wuhan, China, where Covid first appeared at the end of 2019.So what do we know for sure, and what do we need still to find out?We know the sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is close to that of bat coronaviruses. Several decades ago its ""ancestor"" was circulating in bat populations in southern Asia.:But there are still many unanswered questions: we don't know how the virus arrived in Wuhan, how its sequence evolved to allow human infection, and under what conditions it infected the first people who crossed its path. And for each of these stages, we don't know whether there was a human contribution (direct or indirect).Zoonotic transmission pathways, in other words the passage of viruses from animals to humans, are now widely documented around the world. Scientists even consider that this is a principal mechanism for the spreading of new viruses.But the fact that the pandemic began in the vicinity of a main virus research centre that specialises in the study of coronaviruses with epidemic potential in humans - the Wuhan Institute of Virology - has given rise to another hypothesis, the lab leak theory. Lab accidents have already led to human infections, including the H1N1 flu pandemic of 1977, which killed more than 700,000 people.Which theory is correct? In the absence of definitive proof, and without promoting conspiracy theories, there needs to be a serious international conversation about the origin of SARS-CoV-2.:The zoonosis theoryIn the scientific community, the debate on the origin of SARS-CoV-2 started with the publication of two articles at the very beginning of the outbreak.The first, dated February 19, 2020, was published in the medical science journal The Lancet. This article, signed by 27 scientists, highlighted the efforts of Chinese experts to identify the source of the pandemic and share the results. The authors deplored ""rumours and misinformation"" about the origins of the virus, and stated that they ""strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that Covid-19 does not have a natural origin"". The authors based their opinion on the first published sequence data, but did not detail the scientific arguments supporting a natural origin. :In March 2020, another article published in Nature Medicine provided a series of scientific arguments in favour of a natural origin. The authors argued:The natural hypothesis is plausible, as it is the usual mechanism of emergence of coronavirusesThe sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is too distantly related from other known coronaviruses to envisage the manufacture of a new virus from available sequencesIts sequence does not show evidence of genetic manipulation in the laboratory.This last argument can be questioned, as methods do exist which allow scientists to modify viral sequences without leaving a trace. These include cutting the genome into fragments that can later be joined together or, more recently, using the ISA protocol, whereby overlapping fragments naturally come together in cells through homologous recombination: a phenomenon in which two DNA molecules exchange fragments. Besides, genetic manipulation is not the only scenario compatible with a laboratory accident or leak.:Meanwhile, intense research that has been carried out for more than a year to try to prove the zoonotic scenario has not been successful so far: all 80,000 animal samples, from some 30 species, have tested negative. The samples came from farm animals and wild animals from different provinces in China. But it is important to note that this large number of negative samples does not refute the zoonotic scenario.The lab theoryThe first articles arguing for the laboratory accident theory received little attention, perhaps because they came from groups like the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which tends to be critical of technology, or outsiders such as the DRASTIC team (an acronym for ""decentralized radical autonomous search team investigating Covid-19"").Composed of 24 self-styled ""Twitter detectives"" who are mostly anonymous with the exception of a few scientists participating under their real names, the DRASTIC group formed on Twitter in 2020 and has set itself the mission of exploring the origins of SARS-CoV-2. Information and arguments from the group have been examined in their own right, taken up and developed by some virologists, microbiologists and science communicators.:In July 2020, one of the authors of this article, Etienne Decroly, co-wrote a scientific paper discussing the possibility of a laboratory accident. The lab leak theory gained wider traction after a May 13 article in the journal Science, signed by 18 scientists, called again for the origins of SARS-CoV-2 to be examined.:The Wuhan Institute of Virology has been mooted as the potential source of SARS-CoV-2.Ureem2805, CC BY-SASo is it possible? Several elements regarding the emergence of the virus do raise questions. In particular, it has been established that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was handling viruses close to SARS-CoV-2 collected in southern China.In addition to direct genetic manipulation, a laboratory accident could also have occurred as a result of infection during collection in the wild or during an experiment with a virus that evolved in cells or mice in the laboratory, without necessarily directly manipulating its genome.How can we find out for sure?In an investigation at the start of this year, a joint commission between China and the World Health Organization (WHO) failed to identify the cause of the pandemic, concluding that a zoonotic origin is most likely and the hypothesis of a laboratory accident is very unlikely. But the director-general of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced there were still questions that ""will need to be addressed by further studies"".:Determining whether SARS-CoV-2 has escaped from a laboratory will require a more thorough investigation in which investigators have access to sequence databases as well as to the various resources used by Chinese researchers, including laboratory notebooks, submitted projects, scientific manuscripts, viral sequences, order lists and biological analyses. Unfortunately, sequence databases for SARS-CoV-2 have been inaccessible to scientists since September 2019. In the absence of direct evidence, alternative approaches may provide additional information. By analysing the available sequences of SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses in detail, it is possible that the scientific community will reach a consensus based on strong clues, as they did for other outbreaks, including the 1977 H1N1 virus.:Biological black boxesWhether the origin is zoonotic or not, it is necessary to question the consequences of our interactions with ecosystems, the industrialisation of intensive breeding, safety protocols on collecting and experimenting on potentially pandemic viruses, and the proliferation of high-security laboratories, particularly those near megacities.We need to equip facilities that study viruses with safety systems as demanding as those used for studying nuclear energy. This could include the introduction of ""biological black boxes"", similar to flight recorders which allow investigators to recreate the final moments of a plane accident. Access to certain high-risk labs could be made dependent on detailed digital descriptions of experiments; sequencing data could be systematically archived; laboratory air filters could be collected, and if there is a suspicion of pathogen dissemination, the genetic material on their surface could be sequenced.:Such new safety measures should be put in place internationally to limit the risk of future pandemics. As for SARS-CoV-2, it is important to trace its exact origins in order to understand precisely what flaws may have led to its spread.:Virginie Courtier, Directrice de recherche CNRS, genetique et evolution, Universite de Paris and Etienne Decroly, Directeur de recherche en virologie, Aix-Marseille Universite (AMU)This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Many theories have been advanced to explain the origins of the novel COVID-19 coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, ranging from the prosaic finding that it was merely a natural mutation to the conspiratorial claim that it was a bioweapon created in a Chinese laboratory. One much-discussed possibility was that the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus originated in bats and made the jump from bats to humans through an intermediate species.One of the more far-fetched conspiratorial takes on the coronavirus' origins held that the issuance of a new U.S. quarter in 2020 picturing bats on its reverse was a clue indicating that COVID-19 was ""government made"" as part of a plot to ""kill the masses and start a new world"":::The coin in question is part of the America the Beautiful Quarters(r) Program. Authorized by Congress in 2008, the series features 56 quarters released in batches of five per year from 2010 through 2020 (with one additional release at the beginning of 2021), each depicting a national park or other national site in a U.S. state or territory:The America the Beautiful Quarters(r) Program is authorized by Public Law 110-456 -- the America's Beautiful National Parks Quarter Dollar Coin Act of 2008. The Act directs the Mint to design, mint, and issue quarter-dollar coins emblematic of a national park or other national site in each state, the District of Columbia, and the five U.S. territories. As stipulated by the Act, the Mint is issuing five new quarters per year until 2020 in the order in which each honored site was first established, with the final coin released in 2021.:The design of the reverse of the America the Beautiful Quarter representing American Samoa was announced in 2019, and the coin itself was issued in 2020. That design represents the National Park of American Samoa and depicts a Samoan fruit bat mother hanging in a tree with her pup:National Park of American Samoa is located some 2,600 miles southwest of Hawaii and is one of the most remote in the U.S. National Park System. The site includes sections of three islands -- Tutuila, Ta'u, and Ofu. Almost all of the land area of these volcanic islands -- from the mountaintops to the coast -- is tropical rainforest. The park's area totals 13,500 acres, 4,000 of which are underwater.The obverse (heads) design features the familiar image of George Washington by John Flanagan, used on the quarter since 1932. It has been restored to bring out subtle details and the beauty of the original.The reverse (tails) design depicts a Samoan fruit bat mother hanging in a tree with her pup. The image evokes the remarkable care and energy that this species puts into their offspring. The design is intended to promote awareness to the species' threatened status due to habitat loss and commercial hunting. The National Park of American Samoa is the only park in the United States that is home to the Samoan fruit bat.:As far as this conspiracy theory goes, we would point out that the notion the novel coronavirus originated in bats is just one possible theory and remains unproven. And even if that were the case, it is exceedingly unlikely the virus started out in the Samoan fruit bat (Pteropus samoensis), which is found only in the Samoan archipelago and Fiji -- far from the virus' apparent origin point in China. We also note the improbability that a government engaged in the furtive mass eradication of citizens would plan years in advance to plant subtle clues warning the public of the plot.:"
70,70,548.ConcernsofMajorWestC,"Claim:A Carbon Monoxide spike on the west coast indicates that a massive earthquake will soon hit.Rating:Mostly FalseAbout this rating In late February 2016, several conspiracy theory-type web sites reported that carbon monoxide levels had spiked on the West Coast, and that these ""unprecedented"" levels signaled the arrival of a massive earthquake:""Unprecedented"" and ""dangerous"" levels of Carbon Monoxide are being released into the atmosphere from seismic faults.  The levels are so bad, they're dangerous!People on the West coast may find they are having trouble breathing and feel strangely tired.  Some folks may notice the surface of their skin taking on a bright red appearance; the signs of Carbon Monoxide poisoning.[...]Earth emits a burst of carbon monoxide (CO) a few days before an earthquake, according to geophysicist Ramesh Singh, pictured left. He and co-workers from France and the United States report that this gas could be used as one of the precursor signals for an earthquake early warning system.:The above-quoted article was primarily based on data from earth.nullschool.net, a site that gleans and compiles data from various sites to make a visual map of global weather. While it did show an unusual amount of carbon monoxide along the West Coast in February 2016, the site warned that its data is not always correct:Please note that these predictions are experimental and are produced for research purposes only. Use of these forecasts for purposes other than research is not recommended.Articles claiming that there was a major spike in carbon monoxide levels on the West Coast are all based on the same set of data from NASA's GEOS-5 software. On 1 March 2016, NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office released a statement explaining the unusual uptick in carbon monoxide levels:IMPORTANT NOTICE: Elevated carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations over California in the GEOS-5 products since February 25, 2016, are incorrect. They are a consequence of unrealistic emissions derived from satellite observations of fires, which led to elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO (as well as other species).NASA's EOS-Terra spacecraft entered safe mode on February 18, 2016, during an inclination adjustment maneuver. This caused the MODIS instrument to enter safe mode, with the nadir and space-view doors closed. When the Terra MODIS transitioned back to science mode on February 24, 2016, the operating temperatures for the SWIR and LWIR (Short-wave Infrared and Longwave infrared) focal planes have not yet stabilized. As a consequence, some data products have been severely degraded. This includes the ""Fire Radiative Power"" fields that are used by GEOS-5 to compute emissions of CO, CO2, and carbonaceous aerosols by biomass burning.GMAO is working to correct this problem. The GEOS-5 analyses will be re-run from February 24, 2016, using only the EOS-Aqua MODIS data, in order to exclude the unrealistic CO emissions. EOS-Terra observations will be re-introduced once the instrument has stabilized.:The perception of higher carbon monoxide levels was, then, caused by faulty equipment. But even if the spike had been real, a rise in carbon monoxide levels is not a clear indication of a future earthquake:The chance of a major earthquake striking the west coast has not changed in the past week. There are no scientific models that can reliably predict earthquakes, especially based on carbon monoxide emissions. More importantly, there was no sudden spike in carbon monoxide emissions, natural or otherwise.Many of the web sites claiming that an earthquake was imminent pointed to a February 2010 article in Nature Asia, which paraphrased an academic paper published by geophysicist Dr. Ramesh Singh (et al) to explain how carbon monoxide levels rose just before a 7.6 magnitude earthquake in western India in 2001:He and co-workers from France and the United States report that this gas could be used as one of the precursor signals for an earthquake early warning system.The scientists used data from an American satellite and analysed changes in carbon monoxide at different altitudes. ""The carbon monoxide shows enhancement in concentration a few days prior to the earthquake,"" Singh said.:""GEOS-5 is a NASA chem model, showing a high concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) along the west coast of California since Feb. 26,"" Singh told us in an e-mailed statement:These websites have included my research paper on their own volition -- unrelated to the CO readings -- and as such, have created misleading stories causing anxiety in some readers.The facts are that the CO image showing high concentrations is associated with the Aliso Canyon ground storage emissions of methane gas. Depending upon the wind, the CO is getting dispersed in all directions. Due to south-west wind, the CO plume is moving over the ocean.You might be aware that no one can predict an earthquake and we do not have an indicator on the basis scientists can say that earthquakes may occur.While atmospheric fluctuations and perturbations have indeed been recorded before major earthquakes, this is still very much research in progress. In fact, seismologist John Vidale (director of the University of Washington's Pacific Northwest Seismic Network) took issue with these web sites connecting Singh's data with the alleged carbon monoxide rise, calling it ""alarmist nonsense""::""Back in the 1970s, when we were looking all possible ways to predict earthquakes, there was an idea that the Earth cracks up in the area about to have an earthquake. And when that cracks, fluid and gases might come out of the ground,"" he said, noting that back then a theory emerged that watching for those gases could indicate where an earthquake was about to hit.""But that was back in the '70s. Now we know the ground doesn't crack across the entire area and that idea just doesn't work,"" he said. ""In the 40 years just then we've been watching faults we have tremendously improved measurements and that kind of signaling just doesn't come before big earthquakes.""[...]""We can't predict earthquakes,"" Vidale said. ""We are not saying we can predict better than these ways that don't work, we're saying that there is no way that works well to predict earthquakes.""""A lot of websites have stories that aren't true and some websites just put up unlikely stories in the hopes that the public looks at them,"" he said:Vidale also said that the data from NASA's GEOS-5 modeling software could be explained by slow-moving air and smoke pollution from forest fires:This diary should be deleted. It is alarmist nonsense. There is a large surface high pressure located over the west coast. The air is almost stagnant. Smog, which is rich in CO and pollution from fires, which is rich in CO, have built up over the west coast and western Canada ... There is no connection of the general pollution pattern today to the San Andreas fault. The patch of high CO over western Canadian fires is a clue.Superstation 95, the web site that first propagated and promulgated this rumor, has a habit of creating dire-sounding stories out of half-truths and misinformation, such as a claim that cargo ships had ceased travel (in ""a horrific economic sign""), an article which heavily exaggerated the effects the Fukushima nuclear disaster had on marine life (using photos stolen from other, unrelated sites), and a prediction that World War III would break out by 28 February 2016 (it didn't)."
71,71,635.SandyHookVictimSpott,"Claim:   Sandy Hook shooting victim Noah Pozner was pictured among those killed during a December 2014 attack on a school in Pakistan.REAL PHOTOGRAPH; INACCURATE DESCRIPTIONExamples:   [Collected via e-mail, January 2015]I have not subscribed to any of the idiocy of the Sandy Hook conspiracy theorists, but this one is genuinely bizarre.Noah Pozner. There is a photo, in a series of related photos showing him in the same clothing, posted on his ""Official Facebook Page."" It is definitely the same child shown over and over again in other photos on the page.The same exact photo appears in multiple sources related to the Peshawar, Pakistan school massacre, allegedly depicting a victim of the massacre. It is unmistakably, undeniably the same exact photo.   Origins:   On 16 December 2014, 145 people were killed in an ambush attack on Army Public School in Peshawar, Pakistan. Among the victims were 132 children ranging in age from eight to eighteen, and the tragedy was reported upon widely across the world.:In late December 2014, a curious photograph ostensibly snapped after the Peshawar massacre began to circulate. In the picture (captioned, above), a woman standing vigil for the victims of the 2014 attack appeared to be holding an image of a small, smiling boy. The image was instantly recognizable to many as the well known face of Noah Pozner, 6, a victim of the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.Twenty children and six teachers were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary in December 2012 during the course of an event that (like the tragedy in Peshawar) deeply upset people across the world. In the aftermath of the 2012 massacre, several conspiracy theories emerged either claiming the murders did not occur in the way they were reported, or the event was wholly fabricated as a ""false flag"" attack. Initially the conspiracies orbited a larger concern that strict gun control laws would be introduced, spurred by the widespread grief that ensued from Sandy Hook. Even when the predictions of a gun grab did not come to pass, the conspiracy theories inspired by the fear of it failed to abate.:When the above-displayed image began to circulate, many of what have come to be known as ""Sandy Hook truthers"" believed it was further evidence a nefarious conspiracy of unexplained origins was at work. Why else would a woman in Pakistan be displaying a picture of Noah Pozner at a vigil for slain Pakistani students who were killed two years after he was?One particularly callous iteration of the claim approached the quandary as if individuals with eyes and the ability to process visual information could not see for themselves the identical picture was used by the woman in Pakistan:Pakistan Taliban boy is identical to Facebook Noah Pozner -- same slightly tilted head, same smile, same jacket collar, and IDENTICAL button hole! (see yellow arrows)Noah's father, Lenny Pozner, has been harassing and bullying bloggers and YouTubers, leading YouTube to repeatedly take down videos about the Sandy Hook hoax because Lenny claims ""copyright violation.""Lenny is also one of the 10 plaintiffs in a negligence and wrongful death lawsuit against the manufacturer, distributor and seller of the Bushmaster AR-15 rifle that Lanza allegedly used in the Sandy Hook school shooting.I hope the defendants ask Lenny Pozner how his son, Noah, managed the impossible feat of being killed twice -- the first time on Dec. 14, 2012 in Newtown Connecticut; the second time two years two days later on Dec. 16, 2014, halfway across the world in Peshawar, Pakistan. [Sarc]:Another recitation of the claim examined whether conspiracy adherents were being taunted via the use of Pozner's image:Can the photo's misuse simply be brushed off as another bumbling Google image search mistake? Is it be willful subterfuge aimed at poking fun at those who question the validity of the Sandy Hook event?A number of explanations might apply to this puzzling photograph. The first is that an image of Pozner was mistakenly included in the vigil by someone who turned up his picture while performing an online search using a term such as ""December school massacre"" to find photos of those killed in Peshawar and and did not recognize his face (because he had dark hair and facial features not unlike those of many of the victims in Peshawar). Another is that his image was deliberately included by mourners as an homage in order to publicly link multiple incidents of young, innocent victims' losing their lives in senseless school shootings.  A third is that a massive worldwide cabal colluded to perpetrate or falsify the murders of more than 150 students and teachers collectively spanning the globe from Connecticut to Pakistan, and the puppeteers of this conspiracy were so inept that they failed the basic task of obtaining novel images to assign to each of the victims of the violent acts. :In fact, the second explanation offered above appears to be what happened: On the day of the Peshawar incident a Pakistani woman created a collage of photographs of young people killed in school shootings and posted it to Facebook with the caption ""They Went to School and Never Came Back."" Because the Peshawar shooting occurred very close to the anniversary of the Sandy Hook massacre, she included a picture of a child from the latter event, namely Noah Pozner, along with pictures of Peshawar victims:That collage was then printed out and cut up into the individual photographs displayed by mourners at a vigil for the Peshawar victims (as evidenced by the thick black borders underneath some of the victims' pictures, such as Noah's, showing where the original collage had been captioned):Last updated:    8 January 2015"

On Nov. 4 don't forget to disguise yourselves as patriots/Trump supporters: wear MAGA hats, USA flags, 3%er insignias, a convincing police uniform is even better!This way police and patriots responding to us won't know who their enemies are, and onlookers and the media will think there are Trump supporters rioting so it's harder to turn popular opinion against us!We found no evidence that this meme was connected to any actual antifa groups.We should note that ""antifa""-- short for anti-fascist -- is not a single group, but a very broad term referring to an amorphous coalition of leftist activist organizations that often act on their own initiative and don't have any centralized organizing body.The flyer has circulated online before in 2017 and 2019, as well as in 2020. Conspiracy theories about anti-fascist groups rioting on Nov. 4 are common, especially across the conservative parts of the internet. However, the 2020 screenshot of the flyer was unique because it was attached to a post referencing the Nov. 3 presidential election, adding fuel to rumors that something could be afoot in the near future.  :Will Sommer, a politics reporter who also focuses on conservative media, investigated the origins of Nov. 4/antifa conspiracy theories and this meme in a 2017 Medium post. He pointed out how the above-displayed flyer was part of many ""fabricated 'planning documents'"" shared on Facebook that urge antifa movements to commit violence. Sommer's report also highlighted how left-leaning, anarchist media hub It's Going Down had disavowed any Nov. 4 activity. The 2020 version of the meme, a screenshot, showed Facebook user Katy Krasnow sharing it to the Hickman County Antifa Facebook group. We reached out to Krasnow and tried to locate the Hickman County Antifa page, which appeared to have been taken down. Krasnow confirmed to us that she did post the meme and it was meant to be a joke. She found it when she searched for ""antifa memes"" on DuckDuckGo, a search engine. She said:Hickman County Antifa was a satire page, either the creator or Facebook took it down, that post was just a bad joke. I deleted soon after it got shared because it made a lot of people freak out more than I expected, nobody in the group was really actually connected, we were just sharing dumb antifa memes.:We reached out to Facebook to learn if the page was indeed deleted by a group administrator or by Facebook, and we will update this post if we receive more information.But whether it was in 2020 or previous years, many people took such memes related to Nov. 4 seriously. Back in 2017, pro-Trump blog The Gateway Pundit ran a headline stating ""Millions of Antifa Supersoldiers Will Behead White Parents"" on that day. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones also claimed antifa activists would be handing out AK-47s on Nov. 4. Snopes investigated similar claims in 2017 that argued law enforcement agents had announced that ""antifa"" was planning ""extended violent unrest or civil war"" beginning on Nov. 4. We found there was no truth behind these rumors.@AntifaChecker, a Twitter account devoted to sniffing out phony ""antifa"" accounts, indicated it was not aware of the 2017 call to action::We found no evidence of violent, antifa-led insurrections occurring in the U.S. on Nov. 4 over the past few years. On Nov. 4, 2017, there were anti-Trump rallies organized around the country by leftist groups, but these were far cries from cases of ""rioting."" In New York City, for example, around 300 people showed up, leaflets were distributed, and only a handful of Trump supporters turned up to counterdemonstrate, according to news reports.Because the source of the above-displayed post confirmed to us it was shared as a joke, rumors of Nov. 4 activity have been disavowed by known antifa media outlets in the past, and we found that this meme had no connection to actual antifa activities, we rate this claim as ""False."":"

U.S. Rep. Mary Miller of Illinois had previously spoken the words ""Hitler was right on one thing"" while standing next to the Capitol at a ""Save the Republic"" rally:Each generation has the responsibility to teach and train the next generation. You know if we win a few elections, we're still going to be losing unless we win the hearts and minds of our children. This is the battle. Hitler was right on one thing. He said, 'Whoever has the youth has the future.' Our children are being propagandized.Today, I want to encourage you to do two things. Fill your children's minds with what is true and right and noble, and then they can overcome evil with good because it can actually discern between what is evil and what is good.:Some Twitter users shared thoughts on the invocation of Adolf Hitler, and appeared to believe the speech was made on the day of the Capitol riot::It's true that Rep. Mary Miller invoked Hitler. Differing with some tweets was the fact that this ""Save the Republic"" rally took place the day before the mob stormed the Capitol on Jan. 5. It was not the same rally where President Donald Trump spoke on Jan. 6 -- the same day as the violent riot. At the same time, there were some violent clashes in Washington, D.C., the night before.The New York Times reported that Miller's speech had been condemned by members of both parties::A freshman member of the House of Representatives said on Friday that she regretted having made an approving reference to Hitler at a rally in Washington -- a comment that drew condemnation from members of both parties and prompted some Democrats to demand that she resign.The congresswoman, Mary Miller, an Illinois Republican, made the remarks at a ""Save the Republic"" rally on Tuesday, two days after she was sworn in as a House member, representing the state's 15th Congressional District.

76,76,425.DoMemesShowSameCrisi,"Claim:The same crying woman appears in photos taken at the scenes of massacres in Sandy Hook, Aurora, Boston, Oregon, Paris, and Manchester.Rating:FalseAbout this rating OriginOn Oct. 1, 2015, ten people (nine innocent victims plus the gunman) died in a mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon. The incident marked the 294th mass shooting in 2015 alone and prompted yet another renewal of a national gun control debate in the U.S.:Folks on both sides of that political debate would likely agree that the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012 was a pivotal point in a perpetual American gun control controversy. Perhaps due to the unique horrors of that event, an unusually high number of conspiracy theories grew out of it: Some gun control advocates on social media later described the tragedy as proof positive Americans weren't interested in changing gun laws despite the exceptional pain inflicted by the incident, while some gun rights advocates asserted the events in Newtown were a government-sponsored false flag engineered to artificially justify a ""gun grab.""The latter camp wasn't much of a fringe movement -- a key law enforcement figure of the Roseburg shooting, Sheriff John Hanlin, had shared Sandy Hook conspiracy material on his own Facebook wall prior to the Umpqua Community College shooting. The Sandy Hook shooting was somewhat of a watershed moment for Second Amendment ""truthers,"" and the conspiracies that sprang forth from it began coloring subsequent (and in some instances, prior) high-profile shootings or attacks on civilians in America.One of the common conspiracy themes that gained traction after the Newtown shooting involved ""crisis actors,"" individuals who had (to that point) been primarily known to populate disaster drills. As the notion of gun grabbing conspiracies became more commonplace, the term was appropriated by folks who believed the faces of those grieving at (staged) shooting scenes or subsequent vigils were in fact paid government operatives assigned to fabricate the appearance of mourning. A common iteration of the rumor involved photographs taken at crime scenes or vigils in Newtown (Connecticut), Aurora (Colorado), Boston::After the 1 October 2015 shooting in Roseburg, the meme was altered to include what was purportedly yet another appearance by the ""same girl"" seen previously crying in photos from Aurora, Boston, and Sandy Hook. (Presumably, the high-level false flag planners didn't have access to social media and remained unaware their schemes had been unraveled and revealed months earlier):::The same technology that enabled people to compile and spread the photo set shown above also allowed anyone interested in the rumor to quite quickly determine whether the ""same girl"" was indeed depicted in all four images included in the meme.The claim was bizarre partly because the individuals involved were not nameless, faceless mourners of whom no trace was found shortly after the respective tragedies. The largest of the images was also the most iconic and heartbreaking: the photograph (taken at Sandy Hook Elementary) that captured the moment during which Carlee Soto learned her sister Victoria Soto was among those killed. The image was not the only one available of Carlee Soto crying, but similar, easily discovered images didn't fit the meme::To the right of Soto in the photo collection (which in several iterations is inaccurately labeled as being from ""Boston"") is Amanda Medek. Medek's sister Micayla Medek was among the dead in the 20 July 2012 Aurora, Colorado, theater shooting, and the image of Medek sitting on steps was one of several captured of her that day::Photographs taken during happier times definitively show that Medek (at the far right) and Soto look nothing alike (save for the moments during which each respectively learned their sisters had been murdered)::Pictured to the left of Soto is Emma McDonald, who (unlike Soto and Medek) appeared to be connected to the victims of the Boston Marathon bombings solely by her presence at a vigil for the victims. As such, McDonald's link to that tragedy was more fleeting (and photographs of her were harder to come by).The young woman shown at the bottom (after the Roseburg shooting) was identified as Jessica Vazquez, seen crying and hugging aunt Leticia Alcaraz. (Alcaraz's daughter Lucero Alcaraz was among the dead at Umpqua Community College)::Following a mass shooting in San Bernardino on 2 December 2015 an iteration of the rumor held the ""same girl"" was again spotted amid news coverage of the event, albeit this time in a larger crowd shot::While all the young women seen in the photographs had long, brown hair (initially), that factor alone didn't make a strong case for a massive government conspiracy encompassing law enforcement agencies at several levels in multiple states (and eventually, multiple countries). In May 2017, the conspiracy theory popped up again after 22 people were killed in a bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England. The ""same girl"" was purportedly photographed in Manchester but unlike the earlier photos, the depicted individual was blonde. She was not identified in the Reuters image, a caption for which indicated it was taken at a crisis center in Manchester City's Etihad Stadium: :The similarities ended with hairstyles and grief-stricken expressions (and in the latter case, the depicted woman was not a brunette). Four of the six women depicted were identified by name at the time they were photographed (the fifth appeared to be a bystander, and the sixth unidentified) and none was transient to the tragedies with which they were associated or disappeared afterwards: Medek and Soto (relatives of victims in tragedies that were not exceptionally recent) went on to appear in multiple photographs and interviews about the respective incidents. In subsequent iterations in Paris and Manchester, the conspiracy broadened in scope to suggest the ""same girl"" was jetted around the globe to visit the scenes of attacks and shootings.Shortly after the Umpqua tragedy, Soto remarked that the continued use of the photograph seen above in the media exacerbated her pain tremendously, and all four of the women initially depicted were likely deeply distressed by the appropriation of their personal mourning for the purposes of advancing a conspiracy narrative."
77,77,456.DoesJoeBidenHaveaBod,"Claim:Photographs of President-elect Joe Biden's earlobes over time shows an individual stands in as him for some public events.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.A rumor holding that U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, 78, used a body double for certain public events emerged on social media during his 2020 campaign against incumbent President Donald Trump and his subsequent transition into the White House. Among the examples of the rumor brought to our attention were a series of TikTok videos uploaded by one user in late November that focused on Biden's earlobes and included following narration::""OK, that's a detached earlobe if I ever saw one. There's clearly two Joe Bidens because when you see this one he has an earlobe that is detached. The other Joe Biden has an earlobe that is straight, it is attached. There's something funky going on here.""In the video, TikTok user @dannycardenasziv apparently recorded a still image of Biden on another media device -- perhaps a television or computer monitor. The image showed the incoming president from the neck up, wearing a suit and tie and facing a direction to show his left ear (see screenshot below) in front of a backdrop with his 2020 campaign slogan, ""Build Back Better."" No visual clues, nor the TikTok user's narration, explained when, where or under what circumstances Biden attended the pictured event.: These were the video's underlying claims: Another human being who looked nearly identical to the incoming president -- except for the earlobes -- not only exists but trades places with the original Biden on occasion. Of the (allegedly) two men shown in the video, one had ""unattached"" earlobes, meaning his earlobes curved and their lowest points were not attached to the sides of his head. Meanwhile, the ""other"" man had earlobes ""attached"" directly to his head.:The same theory surfaced in tweets and Reddit posts, including a page titled ""Is Joe Biden a clone? Check his earlobes,"" that alleged photographic evidence from 2008 and 2020 showed Biden with detached and attached earlobes, respectively. All of those photos showed the president-elect's right, not left, earlobe, just like one of the videos in the TikTok series (screenshot below) alleging the attached look is a sign of a conspiracy.:""Either Biden has different earlobes in 2020 or we have a different Biden [...] or is it an imposter?"" one person tweeted..First, let this be clear: The term cloning, mentioned in one of the claim sources above, refers to human reproductive cloning to produce a genetic copy of an existing person, and that has not been achieved as of this writing, eliminating the possibility that Biden has a literal ""clone"" who stands in for him on occasion.Additionally, some arguments by social media posts were flawed in that they only compared alleged changes in Biden's appearance by examining one side of his face, or the posts used one side to make the argument he had attached earlobes (right) and the other side to argue he had unattached earlobes.It's worth noting here: The call of deciding under what category an earlobe fits is subjective, and there is a spectrum of both detached/attached types given the numerous genetic variations of earlobe traits. Also, the angle from which photographers take portraits of people can affect how earlobes appear in photos.:As a starting point for investigating the conspiracy theory, Snopes obtained the below-displayed portrait of Biden in 1973, during his first year representing Delaware in the U.S. Senate, thanks to the Library of Congress. His earlobes were unattached from his head, as you can see.:We analyzed dozens of images via news reports, Getty Images, government websites and other sources that showed Biden throughout his career, including during his final Senate term (Jan. 2007 to Jan. 2009) and tenure as vice president in former President Barack Obama's administration (Jan. 2009 to Jan. 2017). The photo below, for example, was taken at the Concordia Europe Summit on June 7, 2017, in Athens, Greece. Biden's right earlobe appeared unattached. (Photo by Leigh Vogel/Getty Images for Concordia Europe Summit):Considering the feature image on this report showing the president-elect on Dec. 14, 2020, after states certified voter tallies affirming his presidential win over Trump, as well as other photographic evidence in 2020, we can say definitively: Biden's right earlobe looked noticeably different during and after his 2020 presidential campaign compared to eras prior.But that fact aside, alleging that the apparent change in Biden's appearance revealed a secret ""body double"" scheme erroneously eliminates other, and potentially more likely, explanations for the change.In other words, advocating the Biden body double theory required ignoring the simple fact that Biden was aging like every other human (and, therefore, his appearance was changing), and the possibility that he had a medical issue that required facial surgery, or that he sought a face-lift for cosmetic reasons, altering at least one of his earlobes. According to Mayo Clinic:""In general, a face-lift involves elevating the skin and tightening the underlying tissues and muscles. Fat in the face and neck may be sculpted, removed or redistributed. Facial skin is then re-draped over the newly repositioned contours of the face, excess skin is removed, and the wound is stitched or taped closed."":Considering that process, scars or other physical changes to patients' ears are signs of face-lifts, according to Dr. Anthony Youn, a Michigan plastic surgeon, according to CBSNews.While Biden himself has, to date, not commented on if or to what extent he underwent facial cosmetic surgery, rumors that he had had surgery appeared in news reports, including an Oct. 27, 2019, New York magazine profile that read:There, just behind the ear, is where you can supposedly observe the scar from a face-lift, one of many cosmetic procedures Biden is rumored to have had.The dramatic change to Biden's appearance is a matter of preoccupation for Biden-watchers. In the timeline of images from throughout his career, you can observe as he grows older and then younger and then older but somehow more elegant and alert.Roughly one year later at a Trump rally, the sitting president highlighted the unsubstantiated claim in attempt to discredit Biden and his use of masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19. ""Whatever makes you feel good,"" Trump said. ""I mean honestly, what the hell did he spend all that money on the plastic surgery if he's going to cover it up with a mask?"":After that comment, a Detroit radio station, WWJ Newsradio 950, interviewed Michigan cosmetic surgeon Dr. Gregory Roche, who claimed Biden indeed had a face-lift and possibly other work done, based on his public appearance.In sum, considering the speculation that Biden may have received facial surgery and that those procedures were the most likely and plausible reasons for any changes in his appearances -- as well as the facts that there has been no human reproductive cloning as of this writing and that differences in physical characteristics beyond earlobes would emerge as evidence of the alleged body-double conspiracy -- we rate this claim ""False."""

Because Parler is down, we don't know the exact date of the above post, but we know that it was posted shortly after the Jan. 6, 2021, pro-Trump Capitol riot, during which a laptop really was stolen from Pelosi's office.It also states that Trump's conspiracy theory-minded lawyers Sidney Powell and Lin Wood were in front of a military judge and securing 195,000 sealed indictments that would lead to mass arrests. It goes on to warn readers that they should stock up on supplies to ""hunker down"" for 10 to 12 days while Trump installs a new government.The Parler post above appears to have been written by Ron Watkins, the administrator of the message board that hosts Q, the fictional prophetic figure in the Qanon conspiracy theory. The story spread on various other social platforms. But, it's not true. :We'll first debunk the laptop conspiracy theory. Then the claim about Powell, Wood, and indictments.One of the most widely seen images from the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot shows a rioter sitting in Pelosi's office with his feet up on her desk in a violent day that left five people dead. Congress was meeting that day to certify Electoral College votes for President-Elect Joe Biden.Contrary to the idea that the stolen laptop was full of incriminating evidence, Pelosi's Deputy Chief of Staff Drew Hammill tweeted that it was ""only used for presentations."" And Pelosi had never headed to a border, only to be detained at an undisclosed location. She was instead at the Capitol and in the House Chamber the night of Jan. 6 to finish certifying Electoral College votes. On Jan. 13, 2021, she was again in the chamber, where she voted to impeach Trump for the second time for inciting an insurrection. Per Trump's public schedule, he hasn't left Washington, D.C., since the Capitol riot, save for one trip to Alamo, Texas, on Jan. 12 to visit the U.S.-Mexico border wall. There is no indication he visited the military base at Cheyenne Mountain.:There's also no evidence for the fabulist claim that discredited attorneys Powell and Wood, who had aggressively pursued failed court cases seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential election on behalf of Trump and made numerous outlandish statements in the process, had secured any indictments from any judge, let alone 195,000. We note that the weekend since the riot took place came and went, with no mass arrests of Trump's political opponents. Law enforcement, however, has commenced a nationwide manhunt for rioters who committed crimes during the Capitol riot.Trump and his supporters for months have been aggressively promoting a disinformation campaign alleging the November 2020 election was beset by a massive scale voter-fraud conspiracy. These claims culminated with speeches by Trump and others given in D.C. at a rally that incited supporters to march to the Capitol in an event that ended with mass violence.Trump's own administration countered the election-fraud claim, observing that the election was ""the most secure in American history."" Trump's political rival President-elect Joe Biden won the election and will be inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2021.:"

While this tabloid no longer appears to be in print, archived versions of these pages are still online. :In June 2011, an Irish tabloid known for publishing conspiratorial content called ""The Sovereign Independent"" published an article about Bill Gates that carried the misleading headline ""Depopulation Through Forced Vaccination: The Zero Carbon Solution!""An image of this newspaper article resurfaced during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 along with a variety of false claims. Social media users claimed, for example, that this newspaper was proof that the pandemic had been ""planned."" Others claimed that this article had been ""scrubbed"" from the internet -- a false claim to make this article appear extra nefarious -- and that the pandemic was somehow connected to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.:This is a genuine image of a headline that was published in an Irish tabloid in 2011. But this headline is misleading, this article isn't proof of a planned pandemic, COVID-19 is not related to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and this newspaper has not been ""scrubbed"" from the internet. The Sovereign Independent was an Irish tabloid that started publishing circa 2009. While the website is still live, it is full of broken links and images and appears to have last been updated in 2014. An archived copy of the above-displayed headline can be seen here. In other words, it has not been scrubbed from the internet. It should also be noted that this was not a ""newspaper"" with a credible track record of reporting. Rather, this tabloid trafficked in conspiracy theories, promoting content from organizations such as AE911Truth, a group that believes 9/11 was the result of a controlled demolition, not a terrorist attack, and Infowars.com, the website operated by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who falsely claimed for years that the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School was a ""false flag."" :The June 2011 issue of ""The Sovereign Independent"" where this Gates headline comes from, for example, included an article from PrisonPlanet.com, an offshoot of Infowars, claiming that the death of Osama Bin Laden was a hoax. The ""Depopulation Through Forced Vaccination"" headline deals with a well-trodden conspiracy theory that is based on a relatively simple misunderstanding. While many see the word ""depopulation"" and think of something like genocide (the implication here is that Gates wants to kill people via vaccinations), that isn't the case here.Gates does view the rising human population as a problem, and he truly has focused on efforts to slow population growth. But these efforts were not based on killing people. In fact, the opposite is true. Gates found that population growth can be slowed by keeping people alive. :One initiative, for example, focused on providing easy access to birth control (less babies means less people). Another imitative focused on providing access to medical care and vaccines. The thinking here, as explained in the 2009 Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Annual Letter, is that you can slow population growth by lowering the mortality rate, especially among children. A surprising but critical fact we learned was that reducing the number of deaths actually reduces population growth ... Contrary to the Malthusian view that population will grow to the limit of however many kids can be fed, in fact parents choose to have enough kids to give them a high chance that several will survive to support them as they grow old. As the number of kids who survive to adulthood goes up, parents can achieve this goal without having as many children.We took a more in-depth look at the conspiracy theories surrounding Gates, vaccines, and depopulation here.

80,80,221.IsBaronTrumpsMarvelo,"Claim:Author Ingersoll Lockwood wrote the books ""Baron Trump's Marvelous Underground Journey"" and ""1900: or, The Last President""  in the 1890s.Rating:Mostly TrueAbout this rating Forget for a moment the seemingly endless series of revelations about the Trump White House's staffing woes, the Russia investigation, and the Seth Rich conspiracy. A pressing matter, largely ignored by the mainstream media has come up: Is Donald Trump a time traveler? :The question has been circulating on conspiracy theory web sites for several months and is backed by various pieces of ""evidence"" (such as Donald Trump's uncle John Trump's purported relationship with Nikola Tesla). Now a series of books published over century ago is receiving attention for their seemingly all-too-eerie connections to the Trump family. The books, one of which is titled Baron Trump's Marvelous Underground Journey, have been discussed on both reddit and 4chan: Baron Trump's Marvelous Underground Journey, and 1900: or, The Last President, are indeed real books by writer Ingersoll Lockwood. (We haven't been able to uncover any evidence proving that Donald Trump and his family have access to a time machine, however). :Both of the books are archived by the Library of Congress and can be read in full on Archive.org. Baron Trump's Marvelous Underground Journey was published in 1893 and 1900: or, The Last President came out a few years later. According to the Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, Lockwood penned at least one other book about the Baron Trump character, The Travels and Adventures of Little Baron Trump and His Wonderful Dog Bulgar, which was published in 1890.  A July 2017 article in Newsweek noted several prescient-seeming connections, such as the novel's Russian setting, a character named ""Don,"" and a ""Fifth Avenue Hotel"" in New York City, where Trump Tower currently stands:There are some incredible connections to be made to the first family of the United States and Lockwood's novels from the turn of the 19th century. For starters, the main character's name is the same as President Donald Trump's son, albeit spelt differently. Trump's adventures begin in Russia, and are guided thanks to directions provided by ""the master of all masters,"" a man named ""Don.""Before leaving for his voyage through the unknown, Trump is told of his family's motto: ""The pathway to glory is strewn with pitfalls and dangers."":[...]But by Lockwood's third novel, The Last President, things become even more eerily linked to the present day.The story begins with a scene from a panicked New York City in early November, describing a ""state of uproar"" after the election of an enormously opposed outsider candidate.""The entire East Side is in a state of uproar,"" police officers shouted through the streets, warning city folk to stay indoors for the night. ""Mobs of vast size are organizing under the lead of anarchists and socialists, and threaten to plunder and despoil the houses of the rich who have wronged and oppressed them for so many years.""""The Fifth Avenue Hotel will be the first to feel the fury of the mob,"" the novel continues, citing an address in New York City where Trump Tower now stands. ""Would the troops be in time to save it?""However, some of these connections were slightly exaggerated or outright misstated. For one, the main character is called Baron Trump not because his name is Baron but because he is a baron -- in other words, that's his title. The book begins with a ""Biographical Notice of Wilhelm Heinrich Sebastian Von Troomp, Commonly Called Little Baron Trump"": :As doubting Thomases seem to take particular pleasure in popping up on all occasions, Jack-in-the-Box-like, it may be well to head them off in this particular instance by proving that Baron Trump was a real baron, and not a mere baron of the mind. Newsweek similarly mistakes the Don Fum character's honorific for his name, calling him ""a man named 'Don.'"" In fact, ""Don"" is a Spanish honorific meaning ""Mr.,"" and the character (a ""learned Spaniard"") was introduced by Lockwood on page 2 of Baron Trump's Marvelous Underground Journey: :It so happened at the time of Bulger's low spirits that the elder baron had, through the kindness of an old school friend, come into possession of a fifteenth-century manuscript from the pen of a no less celebrated thinker and philosopher than the learned Spaniard, Don Constantino Bartolomeo Strepholofidgeguaneriusfum, commonly known among scholars as Don Fum, entitled ""A World within a World."" Finally, the book mentions""The Fifth Avenue Hotel,"" meaning that it shares a street with Trump Tower. Since Fifth Avenue is, a well-known part of New York that has been the site for several high-end restaurants, shops and hotels since the late 1800s (the Waldorf-Astoria was constructed on Fifth Avenue in 1893), this detail seems to be more a reflection of the time it was written, and less a prescient note of where Trump Tower would eventually be constructed. Although these books contain some seemingly bizarre coincidences, they are not evidence that Donald Trump has access to a time machine. Time travel conspiracy theories such as this one pick and choose material that supports their conclusions while ignoring everything else. For instance, these books also contain giant turtles, alternate dimensions, a battle with a big white crane, a dog named Bulgar, and a little smiling man frozen in time. Since these aspects have no clear connection to the Trumps, they are omitted from the conspiracy theory. :"

Arkansas police said they are investigating her death as a homicide.:Any death of a political figure in Arkansas, regardless of cause, is typically quickly linked by conspiracy mongers to the decades-old ""Clinton body count"" rumor, which holds that Bill and Hillary Clinton have for years been involved (with impunity) in the murder of scores of people possessed of incriminating information about them.Typically, the deceased are claimed to have been on the verge of testifying against Bill or Hillary Clinton at the time of their demises, thus necessitating hasty bump-offs. (Why the powerful forces behind the Clintons constantly risk exposure by waiting until things reach a critical juncture before they act remains unexplained.)So it was with Collins-Smith, who quickly became the subject of online claims that she was ""set to testify against Hillary Clinton before a grand jury"" within the upcoming week::In reality, Collins-Smith -- who no longer held any political or public office -- neither had any substantive connections to the Clintons nor was investigating them at the time of her death. Likewise, no grand jury activity regarding the Clintons was taking place in Arkansas in June 2019. This story had nothing whatsoever to do with the Clintons at all other than that it coincidentally took place in Bill Clinton's home state.Although it may not have been the first or only expression of this particular iteration, one japing tweet perfectly encapsulated how quickly and easily such conspiracy canards originate and spread after events such as unexpected deaths::"
82,82,340.DidtheQueenCallPresi,"Claim:Queen Elizabeth II called U.S. President Donald Trump an ""amazing person"" with a ""good heart"" in a controversially suppressed interview in June 2019.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In the aftermath of U.S. President Donald Trump's state visit to the U.K., France, and Ireland in June 2019, some of his supporters began sharing a meme that appeared to contain glowing praise for the 45th president, provided by none other than Queen Elizabeth II.:The meme contained a photograph of Trump and Her Majesty sitting next to one another, along with the following quotation:""'He's really just an amazing person. So thoughtful, you know. We've had some private talks and he is very genuine. I have a sense about people, and the president has a good heart. In another life, he could be my son'""::The ""In Trump We Trust"" Facebook page provided the following additional context for the purported quotation: ""UK reporter says executives scrapped [an] entire interview with Queen Elizabeth after she repeatedly praised President Trump."" That post was removed on 7 June, but an archived version can be viewed here. On 4 June, the right-leaning, conspiracy-theory website ""Clover Chronicle"" published a post similarly asserting that: ""A staffer at an unnamed MSM [mainstream media] news outlet in the United Kingdom is claiming they were recently involved in an interview with Queen Elizabeth II where she unexpectedly complimented U.S. President Donald Trump. The alleged insider said executives at the organization are 'fuming' because they couldn't salvage the piece due to her relentless praise of the POTUS.""Those claims originated with a 4 June post on the notorious /pol/ section of the online forum 4chan, a frequent source of hyper-partisan misinformation. There, an anonymous member wrote:Was just involved in an exclusive interview with the Queen, but the execs at my company decided not to air it because she praised Trump so fucking much. It was literally impossible to edit and not make it look like total garbage. The brass are fuming, /pol/. It's as if she said fuck it and just spoke her mind. It was AMAZING. Here's just one of the questions/answers between her and the reporter-Q: Many are wondering about your relationship with President Trump? Can you tell us a bit about it?A: He's really just an amazing person. So thoughtful, you know. We've had some private talks and he is very genuine. I have a sense about people, and the President has a good heart. In another life, he could be my son.After that, everyone was absolutely flabbergasted. I could tell it was hard for the interviewer to go on and follow the script, but he/she did nonetheless.:There was no factual basis to this story, and the remarks attributed to Elizabeth were fabricated. A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace confirmed as much to Snopes, writing in an email: ""Her Majesty The Queen does not give interviews, and did not give an interview."""
83,83,262.DidVladimirPutinSayN,"Claim:Vladimir Putin said North Korea doesn't have nuclear weapons, but does possess trillions of dollars in mineral wealth.Rating:UnprovenAbout this rating On 11 August 2017, the disreputable web site Neon Nettle posted a story reporting that Russia's president Vladimir Putin made remarks indicating that the United States was threatening war with North Korea not over nuclear weapons, but because of hopes of exploiting ""trillions"" of dollars worth in minerals supposedly untapped in the normally isolated, autocratic nation.:Neon Nettle attributes the following remarks to the Russian president:[North Korea] don't have any nuclear weapons. This is a lie being forced on the people by the corporate-owned Western media.They know they can easily provoke the North Koreans and they will react, but the story that they are a threat is false. I will tell you the facts about North Korea: They don't have nuclear bombs. They don't have Western-controlled banks. They don't depend on the US dollar. What they do have is a land full of wealth in unmined minerals.We could find no evidence that Putin made these remarks -- the comment is not quoted in any publication outside of Neon Nettle, a web site that propagates and pushes conspiracy theories and fake news. For example, Neon Nettle was one of the many disreputable web sites that pushed the thoroughly debunked PizzaGate conspiracy theory, which also held that Hillary Clinton was involved with a pedophile ring being run out of a New York pizza parlor. They also reported (again falsely) that Soundgarden and Linkin Park singers Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington, respectively, had been murdered because they were about to reveal a pedophile ring. (Both men committed suicide, and there has been absolutely no evidence that they were aware of or otherwise involved in a pedophile ring.):We found no evidence that Putin made these remarks, although Neon Nettle does accurately cite the online business magazine Quartz, which did report that North Korea may be sitting on mineral deposits worth vast sums of money:Estimates as to the value of the nation's mineral resources have varied greatly over the years, made difficult by secrecy and lack of access. North Korea itself has made what are likely exaggerated claims about them. According to one estimate from a South Korean state-owned mining company, they're worth over $6 trillion. Another from a South Korean research institute puts the amount closer to $10 trillion.As to the other part of the claim that North Korea ""doesn't have any nuclear weapons"", it is apparently false, because Pyongyang has been testing them."

Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.On Nov. 20, 2020, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany held a news conference in the White House briefing room. Addressing U.S. President Donald Trump's refusal to concede his electoral loss to President-elect Joe Biden and his administration's stonewalling of Biden's transition team, McEnany said this about Trump's own transition into power after the 2016 election::""Also, something that I would note is, just we talked a lot about transfer of power and the election, and it's worth remembering that this president was never given an orderly transition of power. His presidency was never accepted.""The claim was at odds with reality.In 2016, after being defeated by Trump, Hillary Clinton gave a concession speech the day after the election. ""We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead,"" she stated in the speech.Trump in 2016 stated that Clinton contacted him the night of the election in what he described as a ""lovely"" phone call: ""She couldn't have been nicer. She just said, 'Congratulations, Donald. Well done.'""Similarly the General Services Administration, an executive branch agency that is currently under fire for its refusal to hand transition resources off to Biden's transition team, gave Trump's team the reins the day after Election Day in 2016.:McEnany's comments were even contradicted by those made by the president himself during his inauguration address on Jan. 20, 2017:""Every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power. And we are grateful to President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent.""The transition period between Biden's election and inauguration has been anything but ""orderly."" Trump and his supporters, including McEnany, have echoed a conspiracy theory holding that Trump only lost the election on account of a massive voter fraud scheme involving deceased Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and billionaire philanthropist George Soros.In an unprecedented move in the modern era, the Trump administration has blocked Biden's team from accessing millions of taxpayer dollars allocated for the transition process, as well as members of government agencies. Trump's General Services Administration head Emily Murphy has refused to sign a letter releasing those resources.:"
85,85,517.NoSenChuckSchumerWas,"Claim:Sen. Chuck Schumer's name and/or phone number were found in ""Hollywood Madam"" Heidi Fleiss's black book of clients.Rating:UnfoundedAbout this rating OriginWas Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., once a client of the notorious ""Hollywood Madam,"" Heidi Fleiss, who ran a prostitution ring in Los Angeles catering to the rich and powerful during the early 1990s?:Readers started posing that question to Snopes in January 2019, in the midst of a resurgence of the then-year-old rumor on social media. Judging from the Facebook and Twitter posts we were alerted to, one might easily suppose the answer was settled fact. For example, this Facebook message was posted on Jan. 5: :This meme was tweeted on Jan. 22: :And here's a tweet from Jan. 23: Is There a Fleiss-Schumer Connection?Heidi Fleiss's ""black book"" of clients (actually a set of Gucci day planners with red bindings) was said to contain the names and phone numbers of some of the biggest celebrities in Hollywood, not to mention prominent businessmen and politicians. But Fleiss was fiercely protective of her client list and to this day, according to press reports, had refused to make its contents public. Someone claiming to have possession of it (possibly having stolen it from an FBI evidence room) put it up for auction on eBay in 2015, but the offering was mysteriously withdrawn a few days later.:In 1995, a prostitute who worked for Fleiss named two of her clients, actor Charlie Sheen (which Sheen himself confirmed) and former Denver Nuggets owner Sidney Shlenker (who also admitted in court to being a client of Fleiss). Various other famous names have come up in supposed ""scoops"" published by less-than-reliable sources, but to date the roster of confirmed Fleiss clients remains minuscule.Notably, the name of Sen. Chuck Schumer has appeared in none of those stories. We searched media archives going back to 1990 and were unable to locate a single instance of Schumer's and Fleiss's names coming up in the same article. In point of fact, their names weren't publicly linked in any context until December 2017, when posts similar to the ones reproduced above first began appearing on social media.The earliest such post we've found was a tweet dated Dec. 9, 2017::The tweeter didn't say where that information came from.The next time we found Schumer and Fleiss's names in such close proximity was 10 days later in online discussions following a so-called ""Q drop"" -- a post on the internet troll message board 8chan by the enigmatic ""Q,"" an entity believed by his (or her, or their) followers to be a highly-placed member of the Trump administration who purports to share earth-shattering insights into the president's battle against ""deep state"" corruption.Also described as ""bread crumbs,"" the posts are intentionally cryptic and understood by Q's fanatical fan base (collectively known as ""QAnon"") to be hints for further ""research"" as well as inspiration for pro-Trump propaganda to be disseminated on social media. Taken as a whole, the voluminous output of Q and QAnon is best described as a chaotic assemblage of disinformation and conspiracy theories touching on topics ranging from alleged acts of deep-state treason by Trump's enemies in the government and media, to the exposure of alleged sex trafficking and pedophile rings operated by and for the so-called ""Washington elite"" (basically, everyone in D.C. other than President Trump and his loyalists). Q's predictions and pronouncements have proved to be off the mark and flat out false more times than anyone can count, but in every case QAnon followers have either ignored these outcomes or found ways to rationalize them away and moved on.:The Q drop in question doesn't even mention Chuck Schumer by name, interestingly enough. Instead, the initials ""CS"" are repeated three times in a list pairing the initials with the names Soros (George, presumably), Playboy (the magazine, no doubt), and Heidi Fleiss (the one and only Hollywood Madam):We note that in the discussion that immediately followed among 8chan members, several articles about Heidi Fleiss and her prostitution ring were posted, none of which corroborated any link between Fleiss and Chuck Schumer. Nevertheless, the respondents to Q's post dutifully filled in the blanks, interpreting ""CS"" to mean ""Chuck Schumer"" and ""blackmail"" to mean that Fleiss (or someone) must have compromising information about the senator. The content of anti-Schumer memes to come was thus spelled out and concretized in real time.:""Chuck Schumer was set up by playboy/heidi fleiss in service of the clowns,"" wrote one follower. ""Is now being blackmailed by them. Wow.""""So meme-o-licious,"" wrote another.Less than 10 minutes later, the first Facebook-ready meme had already been uploaded to 8chan::This and similar memes meme appeared amidst a flurry of posts on both Facebook and Twitter around that time, echoing the 8chan users' assertion of a direct link between Fleiss and Schumer. This specimen with #QAnon and #MAGA hashtags was tweeted on Dec. 19, 2017, the same day as the Q drop: :As usual, some people who shared the rumor couldn't resist amplifying the details. In the following tweet, for example, the user alleged that Schumer and Fleiss were somehow involved in the trafficking and ritual abuse of children::And the March 2018 tweet below explicitly linked Schumer and Fleiss to the hashtag ""#PizzaGate,"" which referred to a discredited hoax/conspiracy theory alleging that the Clintons and other Democratic Party luminaries operated a pedophile ring out of a family pizza parlor in Washington, D.C. (The shameless promotion of that hoax on social media and conspiracist websites ultimately led to shots being fired inside the restaurant.): :Since then, the rumor has continued to circulate on social media at infrequent intervals, often in meme form. As we noted at the top of this article, the frequency of those posts picked up again in January 2019, perhaps as part of a general propaganda effort against Democratic congressional leaders as the appropriations battle over funding for Trump's border wall heated up in the midst of the longest U.S. government shutdown ever.Our research into this topic spanned 30 years of published materials, yet we found zero evidence to support the assertion that Sen. Chuck Schumer ever patronized Fleiss's Hollywood prostitution ring, or was connected to her in any significant way. Indeed, we found no evidence that Schumer was even accused of such a thing prior to the rumor's online debut in December 2017."

What's FalseHowever, it cannot be assumed that Davis contracted COVID-19 at the June 10 church event, which the organizers described as a ""Release Party,"" not a ""COVID party."" The latter description originated from other commentators critical of the church and its purported COVID-19 policies. What's UndeterminedIt's not clear what rules or guidelines, if any, were implemented or enforced by organizers of the June 10 ""Release Party,"" or what proportion of the young attendees wore masks and observed social distancing. :Snopes is still fighting an ""infodemic"" of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

In July 2020, readers asked us about the circumstances surrounding the passing of Carsyn Leigh Davis, a 17-year-old from Fort Myers, Florida, who died after contracting the COVID-19 coronavirus disease weeks earlier. In particular, readers asked us to examine the accuracy of news reports and online posts that claimed Davis had died 13 days after attending a ""COVID party"" at her family's church. The website Raw Story published an article with the headline ""Florida Teen Dies After Conspiracy Theorist Mom Takes Her to Church 'COVID Party' and Tries to Treat Her With Trump-Approved Drug: Report."" The article went on::""A Florida mother took her high-risk teenage daughter to a 'COVID party' at their church, tried treating the girl at home with unproven drugs when she got sick -- and then hailed her as a patriot after she died.""The claim that Davis had attended a ""COVID party"" appears to have originated in a July 5 blog post on the website FloridaCovidVictims.com, which wrote that:""She [Davis] had survived cancer, her mom reported, and was a caring and giving person. She was known for her huge heart and good nature, despite all of her health problems. She had nearly died as a child, but developed a strength and love of life that made everyone around her smile. So then why in God's name did her mother take her to a 'COVID Party' at their church on June 10 to intentionally expose her immuno-compromised daughter to this virus? ... On June 10, Carysn's [sic] mom, Carole, took Carsyn, a 16-year-old girl who was immuno-compromised with a history of health issues (including cancer), to a 'COVID party' at her church, where more than 100 children without masks were in attendance.""The ""COVID party"" claim was subsequently repeated in articles and posts published by Newsweek, the Daily Kos, and Alternet.:Davis did die of complications from COVID-19, with several underlying health problems as contributory causes. On June 10, she did attend an event at her local youth church at the First Assembly of God in Fort Myers. However, reports that it was a ""COVID party"" were inaccurate and based on a gross misrepresentation of real descriptions of the event. AnalysisAn investigations report by the Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner Department provided the following account of Davis' death:17 year old female with a complex medical history including opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome (resolved at 5 years of age), hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction, precocious puberty, morbid obesity who present [sic] with respiratory failure. The decedent's mother and father are a nurse and physician's assistant, respectively.On June 10, the decedent attended a church function with 100 other children. She did not wear a mask. Social distancing was not followed. The parents prophylactically treated her with azithromycin (6/10-6/15). On June 13, she developed frontal headache, sinus pressure, mild cough. The family thought her symptoms were due to a sinus infection. The symptoms persisted.:On June 19, the mother noted she looked ""gray"" while sleeping. She tested the decedent's O2 saturation and it was in the 40s. The mother borrowed the decedent's grandfather's home oxygen (he has COPD) and her O2 saturation rose to the 60s on 5L. The parents gave her a dose of hydroxychloroquine. The parents took her to Gulf Coast Medical Center and she was transferred to Golisano Hospital PICU.On June 19, 2020, she was found to be positive for SARS CoV-2. Her LFTs [liver function tests] were significantly elevated. The parents declined intubation. The decedent received convalescent plasma therapy on June 20 and 21st. On June 22, 2020 the decedent's condition had not improved and intubation was required. The decedent was intubated. Her cardiorespiratory status continued to decline.On June 22, 2020, despite aggressive therapy and maneuvers, her best O2 saturation was low 70s. The mother requested heroic efforts despite knowing she had low chance of meaningful survival. Preparations were made to perform ECMO [extracorporeal membrane oxygenation] on the decedent. The decedent was transferred from Golisano Hospital to the Nicklaus Children's Hospital for ECMO. She was transported without incident directly to the cath lab at Nicklaus Children's for ECMO cannulation. After cannulation she required escalation of inotropic support and vasopressor support. She was transferred to the PICU after the procedure and continued to deteriorate requiring increasing doses of pressors.:Chest X-ray was performed and showed severe bilateral infiltrates and subcutaneous emphysema. She developed worsening distributive shock and multiorgan failure. She was to undergo dialysis and plasmapheresis however due to rapid deterioration and inability to bring up oxygen saturation, these interventions were unable to be performed. Echocardiogram was performed and showed no cardiac function, pupils were 5 mm and fixed. She was pronounced dead on 6/23/2020 at 1306.The report specified that Davis' cause of death was ""Complications of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) Pneumonia,"" with the following listed as contributory causes: ""Hypothalamic-Pituitary Axis Dysfunction, Morbid Obesity, Bronchial Asthma.""It's not clear how or where Davis contracted COVID-19. According to the medical examiner's report, she first developed symptoms three days after attending a church event with 100 other children. However, COVID-19 symptoms can take between two and 14 days to appear after exposure, so it cannot be assumed that Davis caught the virus at the June 10 church event. It's true that Davis' parents did attempt to treat her illness with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine, a controversial proposed treatment for COVID-19 that has been touted by President Donald Trump. That aspect of the news reports mentioned above was accurate.:However, no evidence has been presented to support the claim that the June 10 church event was billed as a ""COVID party,"" or was designed as a forum for young people to intentionally or wantonly expose themselves and others to the disease.Rebekah Jones, a data scientist who was fired by the Florida Department of Health after what the department told Snopes was a ""a repeated course of insubordination"" and ""blatant disrespect"" for her colleagues, first uncovered the medical examiner's report on Davis' death. (Jones has insisted she was fired for refusing to manipulate COVID-19-related data, while the Associated Press reported she had repeatedly made unauthorized public comments on the state's COVID-19 data-collection methods.)That document was first published on FloridaCovidVictims.com, which is run by Florida Covid Action, an alternative provider of COVID-19 data in Florida, and an initiative by Jones and others. On Twitter, Jones posted what appeared to be a screenshot taken from the Facebook page of First Youth Church at the First Assembly of God in Fort Myers -- the Davis family's church. In a June 10 post, First Youth Church wrote::""Service is back and better than ever! We will be having our Release Party in the gym TONIGHT at 6:45. There will be games, awesome giveaways, free food, a DJ and music, and the start of our new sermon series. AND we'll be starting Summer Nights afterwords [sic] with karaoke and basketball! We hope to see you there!""It was Jones, and not the church itself, who described the June 10 event as a ""COVID party,"" and the screenshot, presented as evidence by Jones, actually undermines her own contention that the event attended by Davis and others was a ""COVID party."" The FloridaCovidVictims.com blog post was especially misleading, because it placed quotation marks around the phrase ""COVID party,"" falsely indicating that that description originated with the organizers themselves. :On July 7, in response to the news reports mentioned above, the First Assembly of God posted a strongly worded news release on Facebook, firmly rejecting claims that the church had hosted a ""COVID party"":""Over the past 24 hours First Assembly of God of Fort Myers has been accused of hosting 'COVID-19 parties.' Nothing could be farther from the truth. First Assembly of God of Fort Myers is following all of the health protections and protocols recommended by the state and local government with regard to holding its church services. Let us be clear -- media reports and postings accusing the church of ignoring protocols or actively engaging in behavior intended to expose our congregation to the virus are absolutely false and defamatory.""The statement added that claims of a ""COVID party"" were ""based upon irresponsible speculation and inaccurate information.""Although the medical examiner's report notes that Davis herself did not wear a mask at the June 10 event, it's unclear whether others did. Snopes sent a list of questions to First Assembly of God officials, including asking what COVID-19 mitigation guidelines or rules, if any, the church had implemented during the ""Release Party."" We did not receive a response of any kind in time for publication. :Pastor David Thomas told WBBH that the church had taken unspecified precautions to ensure the safety of children at the event, but that it was left to individual children to decide whether to practice social distancing. This indicates that any official church enforcement of social distancing at the event was relaxed.After initial publication, several news outlets and websites updated their articles to reflect the fact that the characterization of the June 10 event as a ""COVID party"" had come from others, and not from the youth church organizers themselves. FloridaCovidVictims.com, whose original blog post formed the basis of several other articles, later removed all references to a ""COVID party,"" instead describing the June 10 event as ""a large youth event at her church, where more than 100 children without masks were in attendance."" The updated post did not provide evidence to substantiate the claim that the 100 children in attendance did not wear masks. Newsweek replaced the phrase ""coronavirus party"" with ""church party"" in its headline, and Raw Story replaced ""church 'COVID party'"" with ""church event"" in its headline, adding the following note: ""Jones' analysis of the medical examiner's report suggested that Davis had intentionally exposed her daughter to the virus at the event, but there's no additional evidence to support that claim. This report has been updated to reflect subsequent reporting on the teen's illness."":At the time of this Snopes reporting, neither the Daily Kos nor Alternet had published similar updates or corrections.

87,87,182.DidLizCheneySaytheRe,"Claim:In response to an interview question about former U.S. President Donald Trump's ""hold on the Republican Party,"" U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said that ""large portions"" of the party, including leadership at the state and national levels, are ""very sick.""Rating:Correct AttributionAbout this rating On Aug. 22, 2022, readers asked if U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., truly had used the words ""very sick"" to describe the Republican Party. We soon found that this was a genuine quote.:The ""very sick"" remark from Cheney came during an interview with ABC News chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl. The interview aired on ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos"" on Aug. 21, just days after Cheney lost her primary in Wyoming.We transcribed the complete question and answer from the episode. During her answer, Cheney also mentioned ""the lie."" This may have been a reference to the baseless and debunked conspiracy theory that massive voter fraud occurred  in the 2020 U.S. presidential election and that former U.S. President Donald Trump had won:Karl: What does your defeat say about Trump's hold on the Republican Party?Cheney: I think, one, it says that people continue to believe the lie, they continue to believe what he's saying, which is very dangerous. I think it also tells you that large portions of our party, including the leadership of our party, both at the state level in Wyoming, as well as on a national level with the RNC, is very sick, and that, you know, we really have got to decide whether or not we're going to be a party based on substance and policy, or whether we're going to remain, as so many of our party are today, in the grips of a dangerous former president.:Cheney was one of only two Republicans serving on the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol insurrection. The violent incident in early 2021 was ignited by the same evidence-free conspiracy theory about massive voter fraud in the election.Prior to Cheney's primary loss, The Associated Press reported that her defeat was expected, but that future plans for 2024 might also be in the works:Cheney's unrelenting criticism of Trump from a Capitol Hill committee room represents the centerpiece of an unconventional campaign strategy that may well lead to her political demise, at least in the short term. Many Cheney allies are prepared for -- if not resigned to -- a loss in Wyoming's Aug. 16 Republican primary against Trump-backed challenger Harriet Hageman.But as primary day approaches, there is also a pervasive belief among Cheney's team that her unorthodox strategy in 2022 may put her in a stronger position for the 2024 presidential contest. Cheney's fierce anti-Trump message as vice chairman of the congressional committee investigating the insurrection has strengthened her national brand while expanding a national network of donors and Trump critics in both parties who could boost a prospective White House run.Cheney has yet to finalize any decisions about 2024, but she has not ruled out a presidential run as a Republican or an independent.:In sum, yes, Cheney referred to ""large portions"" of the Republican Party as being ""very sick."""

The ninth anniversary of the Dec. 14, 2012, mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, takes place in less than two weeks.The picture was originally taken by Associated Press photographer Jessica Hill. The official AP caption read: ""In this Dec. 14, 2012 file photo, Carlee Soto uses a phone to get information about her sister, Victoria Soto, a teacher at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., after gunman Adam Lanza killed 26 people inside the school, including 20 children.

It was captioned with: ""Your truck has 3 pedals and I've only got 2 feet. You should have known there would be issues having a liberal girlfriend."":We also found dozens of public Facebook posts that featured the words with Soto's picture. It's unclear how many private posts also posted the meme. Some only included the top part of the caption about the truck and pedals. We chose to not republish the meme in this article.For years, a number of baseless conspiracy theories have surrounded the mass shooting at Sandy Hook. Those conspiracy theories included plenty of instances of photographs being misused to spread falsehoods about the victims, family members, and others.We found multiple comments on the recent Facebook meme posts that claimed Soto was a ""crisis actor,"" which was false. This was one of the baseless conspiracy theories that for years has been posted on social media. Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who owns Infowars, originally spread the false conspiracy theory that the incident at Sandy Hook was a ""giant hoax"" and that the people involved were ""crisis actors.""On Nov. 15, 2021, NBC News reported that Jones ""was found liable for damages in lawsuits brought by parents of children killed in the shooting."":Monday's ruling marks the fourth defamation lawsuit Jones has lost against Sandy Hook families, three of them in Texas....Jones outraged Sandy Hook parents by falsely claiming that the mass slaughter was staged by crisis actors whose goal was to overturn the Second Amendment. He later acknowledged that the massacre occurred. His lawyers defended his speech in court as ""rhetorical hyperbole"" and denied that it was defamation.Lawyers for the parents claimed that Jones and his companies, including Infowars and Free Speech Systems, violated court rules by failing to turn over documents, including internal company documents showing whether and how Jones and Infowars profited from talking about the school shooting and other mass shootings.Jones also recently made the news for a separate matter when he was subpoenaed by a committee investigating the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol insurrection.

Most important to her were the ""SOFACRO"" gang, as the cousins call themselves. Vicki was the glue that held this family together. She was the one organizing all family events, including her favorite holiday, Christmas. She was the only one who could pick out that perfect tree! Secret Santa was a family tradition, as were outings with her cousins as often as they could all get together. She was a ball of energy and was always up for anything! Vicki had many friends and saw them often, but no one could ever replace her Rachel. They were like sisters since meeting in their early days of college. She also loved her black lab Roxie, who she would dress up - yes, dress up - and call her ""Rita,"" ""Rita Ann,"" ""Rooney"" and ""Angela,"" for no apparent reason.Not only was she beautiful on the outside, with those gorgeous blue eyes, but she was smart. Some may even say ""perfect"" and funny with a laugh that was contagious. Although she was taken from us far too soon, Vicki lived life every day and knew beyond her years how precious life truly is. Her mantra was: Live, Laugh, Love. Every single day Vicki did just that. She lived life passionately, laughed often, and loved unconditionally.:To learn more about the life of former Sandy Hook Elementary School teacher Victoria Soto, visit teamvickisoto.com.The victims in the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, were as follows:Charlotte Bacon, 6Daniel Barden, 7Olivia Engel, 6Josephine Gay, 7Dylan Hockley, 6Madeleine Hsu, 6Catherine Hubbard, 6Chase Kowalski, 7Jesse Lewis, 6Ana Marquez-Greene, 6James Mattioli, 6Grace McDonnell, 7Emilie Parker, 6:Jack Pinto, 6Noah Pozner, 6Caroline Previdi, 6Jessica Rekos, 6Avielle Richman, 6Benjamin Wheeler, 6Allison Wyatt, 6Rachel D'Avino, 29Dawn Hochsprung, 47Anne Marie Murphy, 52Lauren Rousseau, 30Mary Sherlach, 56Victoria Leigh Soto, 27"
89,89,184.IsChetHanksTomHanksS,"Claim:Chet Hanks is actor Tom Hanks' son.Rating:TrueAbout this rating In late March 2021, actor and musician Chet Hanks made headlines after making remarks in an Instagram video. This led Twitter users to tweet about Chet purportedly being the son of two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks::One tweet included a video that was shared thousands of times:Another person shared an analogy::It's true that Chet Hanks is one of Tom Hanks' sons. His mother, Rita Wilson, is also an actor in major motion picture roles. Tom Hanks also had another son, Colin, and a daughter, Elizabeth, with his previous spouse, Samantha Lewes. Hanks and Lewes divorced in 1987.The reason why Chet Hanks was being tweeted about in late March and early April was because of two news stories. One involved a phrase from his Instagram videos, while the other was about a purportedly violent incident reported by TMZ.'White Boy Summer'In an Instagram video from late March, Chet Hanks said he had ""feeling"" that it was ""about to be a white boy summer.""VICE reported of the phrase: ""According to Chet, White Boy Summer ultimately means 'nothing but good vibes towards everybody, that means everybody.' He explicitly calls out prejudicial beliefs against anyone from a different background than you, while also encouraging his viewers to 'keep suck-a-duckin.'"":According to Los Angeles Magazine, the ""white boy summer"" concept also included a number of rules about clothing and phrases.TMZ VideoOn March 31, TMZ published a video that showed a purportedly bloodied Chet Hanks after an altercation with an ex-girlfriend:Chet Hanks and an ex-girlfriend are at war over a volatile relationship that recently ended -- with both of them slinging allegations of violence, and there's video of a bloodied Hanks.TMZ has obtained video of what Chet says is the end of an altercation between him and his ex, Kiana Parker, that turned violent back on January 8 at Chet's place in Sugarland, TX. Chet turns the camera on Kiana when she appears to swipe at him as she holds a pot, with a bloodied Chet reappearing in the next frame, saying she charged at him with the knife ... something Kiana denies.Chet's not the only one to claim violence ... Kiana got a restraining order against Chet in January, alleging he roughed her up on multiple occasions between Oct. 2020 and Jan. 2021.:The video appeared just days after Hanks' ""white boy summer"" comments were trending online.Conspiracy Theory TrollingHanks also was no stranger to trolling viewers when it came to the debunked ideas in the QAnon conspiracy theory. In a March 2020 video, he made fun of ""a lot of Trump supporters"" who purportedly believed Tom Hanks and his family were all involved in ""elite pedophile sex trafficking rings""::We previously debunked the false rumor.On March 31, @StephBencin tweeted the joke: ""If Tom Hanks is America's dad, that means Chet is America, which totally tracks."" The same was also tweeted earlier by @TheMarkDowling.In sum, it's true that Chet Hanks is the son of Hollywood actor Tom Hanks.:"
90,90,233.DidMailinBallotsSecr,"Claim:As part of a sting operation to prevent voter fraud, the government added either a ""QFS watermark"" or a ""quantum blockchain watermark"" to mail-in ballots that will one day reveal U.S. President Donald Trump as the true winner of the 2020 presidential election. Rating:FalseAbout this rating Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.:Following U.S. President Donald Trump's projected loss in the 2020 election, several vague claims asserting a sting operation aimed at catching Democrats in the act of voter fraud have gone viral. As we explained in an earlier, more general debunker, such claims -- including this one -- rely on a series of deeply flawed assumptions about the role of the federal government in ballot production and the mechanics of the American electoral process. At issue in this fact check is one of the most pervasive claims within this genre of disinformation: The notion that all the ""official"" mail-in ballots in the election had a secret watermark making them identifiable to ""elite units"" of the National Guard who are currently undertaking a secret recount made possible by ""quantum blockchain"" technology. A representative formulation of this claim can actually be found, according to Reuters reporter Brad Heath, on the Facebook page of one of the people cited in a Trump campaign lawsuit purporting to be a witness to voter fraud in Michigan:On Sunday, November 8, 2020, a recount of ballots nationwide was being done by elite units of the National Guards [sic]. To prevent fraud, official ballots had been printed with an invisible, unbreakable code watermark and registered on a Quantum Blockchain System. As of writing, in five states, 14 million ballots had been put through a laser scanner - 78% of which failed because there was no watermark to verify the ballot. Of those ballots that failed, 100% had checked for Biden.:Nothing in the above statement is factually defensible or logically consistent. In fact, the claim originates with a regular InfoWars guest named Steve Pieczenik. While Pieczenik was once a fairly high-level government employee during the Carter administration, he is more famous now for pushing vile conspiracy theories including those that suggest the Sandy Hook mass shooting was staged. (It wasn't.) ""Every one of these paid [Sandy Hook] parents, whoever they may be, are totally, totally disingenuous,"" he once argued alongside Alex Jones.On a Nov. 5, 2020, episode of the InfoWars program ""War Room with Owen Shroyer,"" Pieczenik first laid out the alleged ballot fraud sting scheme, citing unnamed sources within the government:Now I do not work for the federal government. I'm not paid by them. Let me just say again. What I said in 2016, there are honorable members of our intelligence, military, and civilian community in the government who understood exactly how corrupt Biden and the democratic machine is, was, and will be. This is really a sting operation, contrary to what everybody else said. Trump knew this was happening. ... What happened was we marked watermark every ballot with what's called the QFS blockchain encryption code. In other words, we know pretty well where every ballot is where it went, and who has it. So this is not a stolen election. ... All of this was expected. All of this was part of the sting operation we're running.:What is a 'QFS Blockchain Encryption Code'?Early iterations of this conspiracy theory, as reported by other pseudoscientific or conspiracy-focused websites, interpret QFS as ""quantum financial system"" -- a wholly imaginary concept. This purported financial system has its origins in a longstanding conspiracy theory known as NESARA, adherents of which assert that a series of financial reforms (proposed in the 1990s by Harvey Francis Barnard and named the ""National Economic Security and Recovery Act"") were secretly passed and suppressed by the government, but will one day usher in ""an era of debt forgiveness and monetary reform.""Perhaps because Bernard's self-published 1996 book is titled ""Draining the Swamp,"" the possibility of Trump being the leader to usher in that new era became a popular part of the QAnon ecosystem of pro-Trump conspiracy theories. As Logical.ly reported in September 2020, QAnon ""co-opted the global reset narrative"" of NESARA ""to announce that a new era of debt forgiveness and monetary reform -- where cash would be replaced with a gold-backed cryptocurrency -- would imminently be ushered in by none other than Trump."" This new financial future is powered, in theory, by what some claim is a ""quantum financial system."":Believing that a ""QFS blockchain encryption code,"" as Pieczenik called it, is hidden on mail-in ballots also requires a broader belief that an ""imminent global reset"" is about to forgive all of your debt.What About a 'Quantum Watermark'?Later iterations of the claim, like the example from the Facebook page of the Trump voter fraud lawsuit presented earlier, drop the ""QFS"" terminology. These claims retain only the ""quantum"" portion of the concept. ""Official ballots had been printed with an invisible, unbreakable code watermark and registered on a Quantum Blockchain System,"" that person claimed. Terms like ""blockchain"" and ""quantum"" sound impressive and scientific -- which is likely one of the reasons for their use here -- but the way in which these terms are employed in this conspiracy theory is nonsensical.In extremely simplistic terms, blockchain refers to a cryptologic method of preserving and securing digital information. Blockchains are essentially records of transactions stored in a decentralized network in a way that makes them virtually impossible to alter and accessible only to individuals with a mathematically unbreakable cryptographic key. The technology currently exists and underlies, in some form, all cryptocurrency transactions.:In relation to cryptography, ""quantum"" almost always refers to quantum computing. Quantum computing is a real thing. Though still in its infancy and largely theoretical, it is a form of computing that is not based, like all traditional computers, on bits of binary code (i.e. ones and zeros). It has the theoretical potential to offer computational power far greater than anything currently possible. Blockchain systems do not require quantum computers. In fact, quantum computing is a threat to blockchain systems, as they may one day potentially offer enough power to break the previously unbreakable encryption keys underlying such systems.A ""quantum blockchain system"" is like the ""quantum financial system"" --  an imaginary notion.Flawed Evidence Used To Support the Sting NarrativeSeveral of the same bits of evidence allegedly supporting the watermark-based DHS sting are repeatedly cited in message board forums, conspiracy websites, and on social media. These include the existence of a United States Postal Service patent application for a blockchain-based system to secure mail-in voting during elections and purported images of watermarks on ballots. Neither of these items, in fact, support that narrative.:The patent is real, but the Postal Service applied for it in Feb. 2019, it wasn't granted until Aug. 2020, and it is an extremely broad document that does not suggest the development of any specific new technology. David Jefferson, a computer scientist at the Center for Applied Scientific Computing at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, told the outlet Decrypt that the patent ""strikes me as a quick attempt to grab a big swath of patent rights rather than to actually invent anything original."" Whatever its aims, nothing in the patent would have been, or was, ready for the November 2020 election.Additionally, it has been public knowledge since well before the 2020 election or its associated push for mail-in voting that blockchain-based systems are of interest to election officials. They have, in fact, been both proposed and tested for limited use in previous American elections. In 2018, for example, West Virginia tested a blockchain-based voting app named Voatz in that mid-term election, giving the option to service members and their families serving abroad to vote digitally. (It was not used in the 2020 election). In other words, the patent doesn't reveal some new truth about U.S. election officials' interest in blockchain security.:It is similarly unnewsworthy to point out the existence of a watermark on a ballot, even though several such images have been shared as evidence of the veracity or plausibility of the so-called DHS sting. It is public knowledge that most mail-in ballots have watermarks, QR codes, or other security devices included. Like the patent application, the purported existence of a watermark does not confirm any DHS plot, it merely suggests that the mail-in ballot used in your jurisdiction, like thousands of others around the country, employ watermarks as one of their security features.The Bottom Line on 'Quantum Blockchain Systems'As we explained in our broader debunker about this genre of claim, the idea that Democrats could, on a mass scale, merely toss out Trump ballots and replace them with Biden votes betrays a fundamental ignorance of how elections are administered in the United States. Neither the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) nor any other federal agency is ""in charge"" of elections or responsible in any way for ballot production, recounts, or auditing.:While states are in charge of their own elections, the entities responsible for designing, printing, and distributing the actual ballots are private contractors selected by the officials or boards of local election jurisdictions. These companies do not receive their raw paper material from the federal government, and there are over 10,000 different election jurisdictions in the United States. Each of these jurisdictions would have their own ballot design and security features, separate local races, and their own unique identifiers tying specific ballots to specific registered voters.One can not simply print new votes for Biden even if ""quantum blockchain systems"" or ""quantum financial systems"" were real things. As they are not, the claim is ""False."" "
91,91,133.DidChristineBlaseyFo,"Claim:Dr. Christine Blasey Ford made a sexual assault accusation against Justice Neil Gorsuch during his Supreme Court nomination process.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 16 September 2018, Christine Blasey Ford identified herself publicly as the woman who wrote a confidential letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein alleging that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in the 1980s when he was a student at Georgetown Prep.:The news immediately inspired a series of inaccurate ""reporting"" aimed at attacking Blasey Ford's credibility. One such allegation which briefly went viral, despite a wholesale lack of corroborating evidence, was the claim that Blasey Ford had written a similar confidential letter regarding president Trump's previous Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch (who also attended Georgetown Prep), and that she had posted about her idea to do so on Facebook::This claim originated solely in two tweets (garnering over 8,000 retweets) from the Twitter account of Josh Cornett, who describes himself as ""proudly blocked"" by several journalists and/or political Twitter accounts. On 18 September 2018, in a series of two tweets, Cornett claimed that:BREAKING: According to sources Diane [sic] Feinstein's reluctance to mention the Kavanaugh accuser's letter during confirmation session is because the accuser sent a similiar [sic] letter directed at Judge Gorsuch last year. The whereabouts of the earlier letter remain a mystery.developingI was literally forwarded this information 50 minutes ago. Is it true? I have no idea..but the MSM are reporting the Kavanaugh accuser's claim with absolutely zero evidence. So let's report this story too? I will say that my source has been very accurate in the past. Let's see!One source that has decidedly not been accurate in the past is the Twitter account of Josh Cornett, which has at various times promoted the Pizzagate conspiracy theory (which alleged a Hillary Clinton-connected pedophile sex ring run out of the basement of a DC-area pizza shop which has no basement) as well as the the #QAnon conspiracy theory (which alleges that a secret group of patriots deep within the U.S. government are communicating to their followers through riddles posted on the message board 8chan or on websites that sell t-shirts).:Cornett has also claimed that ""99% of Liberal women (Kavanaugh accusers) are bitter, unattractive, Liars, and have a long history of being rejected by men,"" and that he was bored by the allegations of domestic abuse made against former Trump staffer Rob Porter by both of his former wives.As the New York Times reported, Cornett ""appears to have a history of amplifying right-wing misinformation,"" and ""there is no known letter sent by Dr. Blasey about Justice Gorsuch, or any other Supreme Court justice."" There have, however, been additional accusations against Kavanaugh since Cornett's tweets were posted."
92,92,148.WasFlightMH370Foundw,"Claim:A black box recording has surfaced featuring an eerie message that suggests the disappearance of Malaysia Flight MH370 involved extraterrestrials.Rating:FalseAbout this rating OriginOn 8 March 2014, a Malaysia Airlines jetliner carrying 239 passengers and crew disappeared somewhere on a redeye flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The years-long but fruitless efforts to find the missing Boeing 777 have resulted, inevitably, in bizarre conspiracy theories, as no official explanation for how the plane vanished or its whereabouts has been offered -- not even significant leads.:One outlandish fantasy that has made the rounds is that the plane was taken by space aliens, as demonstrated by an apparent Internet hoax that went viral around the incident's fourth anniversary.  The fake news site Your News Wire published an article reporting that a black box recording had surfaced featuring an eerie message that suggested the disappearance of involved extraterrestrials.Images have emerged of the wreckage of missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, just hours after a Black Box recording surfaced featuring an eerie message.The message was in military codesign, which translates to: ""Danger SOS it is dire for you to evacuate be cautious they are not human sos danger SOS."" The eerie voicemail also gave a series of numbers.Users started doing their investigations on the meaning behind the ""series of numbers."" The numbers when used as coordinates, pointed to a location near Malaysia. Digging deeper, it revealed that it was within the area in the radar where flight MH370 was last seen.As is typical of Your News Wire's false reporting, no ""black box recording"" from Flight MH370 was found, and the ""eerie message"" it supposedly contained was based on a purported voicemail received by ""Ty,"" a Twitter user with the handle @strayedaway who has since altered that Twitter account to make it appear to belong to a 15-year-old girl. In the posts about the message, which have since been deleted but are archived, Ty claims a person was taking pictures of him at 3 A.M. from outside his home when he received the strange messages on his cell phone, along with a warning to delete his posts.:In the message, an automated female voice reads off a series of letters in the phonetic alphabet that spell out the message ""Danger SOS it is dire for you to evacuate be cautious they are not human."" The message then reads off a series of numbers: 042933964230.Because of the content of the message and the fact some Internet users have chosen to believe the numbers are coordinates to the region in which the plane is believed to have gone down, the viral voicemail story has been conflated with an all-too-common (but unfounded) conspiracy theory that MH370 was abducted by aliens. As with many viral but completely unfounded stories, the narrative can be found on the message board 4chan.Although there is no evidence suggesting that the message and the Twitter account associated with ""Ty"" are anything other than blatant Internet hoaxes, it is easy to see why the story gained such momentum online. Nine percent of Americans polled by CNN/ORC International in 2014 said they believed aliens from another dimension were responsible for the disappearance of the plane. Since then, virtually no new information explaining the loss of the airplane, its passengers and crew has been made public.:In 2015, Wired reported that the wrenching and upsetting lack of transparency by the Malaysian government which withheld key facts in the days after the plane went missing -- including that the aircraft may still have been flying when search-and-rescue crews began scouring the area where it was last seen on air traffic controllers' screens, and that it had been spotted flying dark and off course by military trackers who took no action -- has contributed mightily to the rumors and theories:The blankness of the investigation became an enormous canvas upon which any fear, rationally considered or raving lunacy, could be sketched into a workable, and not disprovable, theory. Ten per cent of Americans, according to a CNN poll, believe the disappearance of an aircraft involved nothing more complicated than an alien abduction.As of March 2018, the prospect that the mystery surrounding the fate of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 will be solved remains, at the very least, uncertain. On 10 January 2018, one year after intergovernmental search efforts coordinated by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau were suspended, the Malaysian government made a contract with Ocean Infinity, an American deep sea exploration firm. They began canvassing the Indian Ocean, which is believed to be the airplane's resting place, on 21 January 2018. Seven weeks into their search, nothing significant has been found.:"

While dozens of medical experts have already debunked this idea (the evidence indicates that the virus evolved naturally), this bit of misinformation continued to spread on social media. In April 2020, for instance, a lengthy text message started to circulate on Facebook and WhatsApp that supposedly included a quote from Nobel laureate Dr. Tasuku Honjo in which he ostensibly said that COVID-19 was ""invented"" at a lab in Wuhan, China::The text of the post reads: It's as damning an indictment as it could be stretched to. China is accused of inventing the Coronavirus in its Wuhan laboratory with whatever intent that might have prompted the venture.A Nobel laureate Japanese academician, Dr. Tasuku Honjo (pictured below), who had shared a 2018 Nobel prize for his outstanding works in the study of immunology, had revealed the reasons for blaming China for inventing the deadly virus that had already infected, maimed and killed millions across the globe.Professor Honjo maintains, ""I know the Chinese labs where the virus was perfected. I called many times since the Wuhan breakout. Phones are dead. Doctors and technicians involved were killed.""He added, ""natural viruses are temperature and climate-sensitive. Corona had affected every nation, irrespective of geography, climate and temperature. Had it been natural, it's spreading would have been limited to Wuhan like places and climate.""Dr. Honjo threw a challenge in support of his finding and the assertions, saying, ""if it's not proven even after my death, take away my Nobel prize."":Honjo never worked at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the quotes in this post are fictitious, and China did not ""invent"" this virus. But in this message's defense, it does accurately state that Honjo won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2018.Honjo is currently the Deputy Director-General and Distinguished Professor at the Kyoto University Institute for Advanced Study. A biography on the KUIAS website lists the various institutes and academies Honjo has been associated with since the 1960s. The Wuhan Institute of Virology is not included. We searched for the quotes included in this viral text but could not find them reported by any credible sources. In fact, it appears that this quotation exists solely in social media posts. We did find a Twitter account using the handle @TasukuHonjo that expressed similar sentiments as the above-displayed quotes, but it doesn't appear that this account actually belongs to the Nobel Prize winner. :For starters, this account is not verified. It is also only a few days old (its first tweet was posted on April 23) and it has been used almost exclusively to push conspiratorial content regarding COVID-19. The Indian fact-checking website News Meter managed to contact one of Honjo's students who issued a statement on the Nobel Prize winner's behalf. The statement confirmed that this Twitter account was fake, that Honjo never worked at the Wuhan lab, and that these were not real quotes: Prof. Honjo never gave any such statement. Each and every sentence of this post is completely false and has no connection with truth. Prof. Honjo never worked in Wuhan laboratory. He never called there. He did not work on virus origin and functions and other related issues. All the contents are just concocted and nothing else...... The twitter handle you mentioned does not belong to Prof. Tasuku Honjo. it is created by someone possibly with malicious intentions. Please stop this fake news.Furthermore, Honjo's genuine public statements about the pandemic fly in the face of the quotes presented in this viral piece of text.:For instance, in an interview with the Nikkei Asian Review, Honjo was asked why medical advancements have not been able to eradicate infectious diseases. While the fake quote included in the above-displayed text falsely claimed Honjo said that ""natural viruses"" couldn't spread around the globe due to factors such as climate, Honjo's genuine response to this question shows that he actually has the opposite view, saying that ""one novel virus can turn the world on its head"" and that ""infectious disease can spread quickly to a large number of patients.""Honjo said:Medicine has evolved dramatically even compared with 20 years ago, but every new virus requires a new response. Physics and chemistry have established principles, but biology is a science that's still developing, and there's so much we still don't know. So one novel virus can turn the world on its head. Many people probably wonder why, but that's just the reality.Infectious diseases are completely different from something like cancer. Infectious diseases can spread quickly to a large number of patients. Meanwhile, incidence and survival rates for cancer largely stay constant, and expertise in the area is growing steadily.Research into infectious diseases needs to go hand in hand with immunology. There's no point in looking only at the virus, and we need to know how people battling the virus respond to it.:On April 27, 2020, Honjo published a statement saying that he was ""greatly saddened"" that his name, and the name of Kyoto University, have been used to spread misinformation.Honjo wrote:In the wake of the pain, economic loss, and unprecedented global suffering caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, I am greatly saddened that my name and that of Kyoto University have been used to spread false accusations and misinformation.This is a time for all of us, especially those of us devoting our careers to the forefronts of scientific research, to work together to fight this common enemy.

Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.On Dec. 11, 2020, a Twitter user posted a new permutation of a conspiracy theory about Dominion Voting Systems, the technology firm that provided voting systems in multiple U.S. jurisdictions in the November 2020 election, and which has also been the target of a disinformation campaign falsely claiming its systems were used to perpetrate widespread voter fraud.:One of the narratives in the election fraud conspiracy theory holds that voting machines provided by Dominion switched votes from ballots cast for U.S. President Donald Trump to his challenger, Joe Biden, who is now president-elect. Trump has refused to accept his electoral loss, and has perpetuated the lie that Dominion machines were used en masse to flip votes.Hence, more than a month after Biden was declared winner of the election, conspiracy theories continued to flourish. In this case, a Twitter user falsely claimed that Dominion is owned by a member of Biden family, namely his nephew. But the tweet in question is nothing but a patchwork of misleading screenshots and assumptions, based on people sharing a common surname. We cropped the user's name out below::The screenshots in the meme above contain what appear to be the professional biographies of two men, Stephen Owens and R. Kevin Owens, neither of which mentions Dominion.The meme included in the tweet points to President-elect Biden's sister and campaign manager Valerie Biden Owens, with the alleged clincher being that Stephen Owens, a co-founder of Staple Street Capital, an investment firm that owns 75% stake in Dominion, shares a surname. However, ""Owens"" is a common last name, so that hardly serves as proof at all.Valerie and her husband, John T. Owens, have three children, none named Stephen. A spokesperson for Staple Street confirmed in an email to Snopes that Stephen Owens has no relation to the Biden family.And although the meme includes mention of R. Kevin Owens, an attorney who is related to Valerie's husband, we see no connection between this person and Dominion.:In other iterations of this conspiracy theory, the voting systems company has been falsely linked to deceased Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, as well as various Democratic politicians, including U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, and the Clinton Foundation, the charitable foundation run by former President Bill and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Trump's own administration has undermined his post-election disinformation blitz by stating the November 2020 election was ""the most secure in American history.""""There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised,"" the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which is a component of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said in a Nov. 12, 2020, statement."

The U.S. Department of Defense in August 2020 said it is partnering with the private sector to develop both high-powered laser and microwave weapons. The weapons would be used in battlefield or military defense scenarios to hit targets like drones and rockets, and eventually defend aircraft against missiles and bring down ballistic missile threats.In late 2020, in the wake of yet another round of devastating wildfires -- this time raging in California, Oregon, and Washington state -- Facebook users shared the following meme as evidence that the fires were caused by direct energy weapons: :The image above is not from a wildfire in 2020. The original image was taken in 2015 by Associated Press photographer Elaine Thompson.The original image was included in a gallery of photographs published by ABC News depicting the 2015 Valley Fire, which tore through Lake County and Napa County, about 90 miles north of San Francisco. According to investigators, the Valley Fire was caused by a hot tub with improperly installed wiring at a residential home in the town of Cobb.Even without that information, if you inspect the image, you will notice that the plastic slide isn't the only thing undamaged by fire. A number of trees, in addition to a swing set in the background -- which appears to be made of metal components and not microwave safe -- were also undamaged""While some of the [2020] fires are still under investigation, we have no reason to believe any were caused by energy weapons,"" Lynne Tolmachoff, spokesperson for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, told Snopes by phone.While many of the fires were started by dry lightning strikes, some were caused by human activities -- for example, the El Dorado fire was caused by a pyrotechnic device used by a family at a gender reveal party. Experts say that the intensity and frequency wildfires in California as a whole are being exacerbated by climate change.:"

That same rumor was then amplified by Elon Musk in a tweet (since deleted), just days after he had reportedly taken control of Twitter as its new owner. :Related: Is This Paul Pelosi's DUI Mug Shot? It Was a Break-InFirst, let's establish some facts. Based on police statements, The Associated Press reported that the assailant broke into the Pelosi home:An intruder wielding a hammer smashed his way through a rear door into the Pelosi residence in San Francisco shortly before 2:30 a.m. Friday. The man confronted Paul Pelosi and shouted, ""Where is Nancy,"" according to a person familiar with the situation who was granted anonymity to discuss it.Paul Pelosi called 911 himself and when police arrived they found him struggling with the assailant. The man managed to strike Pelosi at least once with the hammer before he was tackled by officers and arrested, police said.Nancy Pelosi was in Washington at the time of the attack.:The New York Times reported that Paul Pelosi underwent surgery on the day of the attack ""after sustaining a fractured skull and serious injuries to his hands and right arm, according to a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi.""In a news conference hours after the assault, San Francisco Police Chief William Scott said of the crime, ""Based on our investigation at this point, this was not a random act. This was intentional. And it's wrong. Our elected officials are here to do the business of their cities, their counties, their states, and this nation. Their families don't sign up for this, to be harmed, and it is wrong. And everybody should be disgusted about what happened this morning.""The assailant, a 42-year-old man named David DePape, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, elder abuse, and burglary.The False 'Male Prostitute' RumorOn the day after the attack, the Santa Monica Observer website published an article that claimed in its headline, ""The Awful Truth: Paul Pelosi Was Drunk Again, And In a Dispute With a Male Prostitute Early Friday Morning."" The story claimed, without evidence, that Pelosi had met DePape at a gay bar and brought him to his house.:The ""drunk again"" part of the headline referred to Pelosi's May 2022 arrest for driving under the influence. He later pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five days in jail and three years of probation.The article, which purported to describe ""what really happened"" in the author's ""humble opinion,"" claimed, again without evidence, that DePape was a ""male prostitute.""The story also said that DePape was a ""former Castro nudist protester,"" a claim backed up by reporting from The Associated Press, which described DePape as ""a two-decade resident of the San Francisco Bay Area"" who ""was known locally as a pro-nudity activist who had picketed naked at protests against laws requiring people to be clothed in public.""On the day after the Observer published its ""humble opinion"" piece, an update was added to the beginning of the article that read, ""Update 10/30: In response to this story, San Francisco Police said today that victim Pelosi and suspect DePape, did not know each other prior to the attack. SFPD reaffirmed that the assault followed a break-in."":Musk Deletes Tweet Amplifying RumorTwo days after the attack, and the same day the Observer added the one-sentence update to its story revealing that it was contradicted by police reports, Musk, who has over 100 million followers on Twitter, tweeted a link to that very article.The AP noted that the same publication had ""previously asserted that Hillary Clinton died on Sept. 11 and was replaced with a body double,"" which was false. It was perhaps a coincidence that Musk's tweet that promoted the Observer's article was in a response to another tweet from Hillary Clinton:Musk [replied] to a tweet by Hillary Clinton. Her tweet had criticized Republicans for generally spreading ""hate and deranged conspiracy theories"" and said, ""It is shocking, but not surprising, that violence is the result.""In response to Clinton's tweet, Musk provided a link to the Santa Monica Observer article and added, ""There is a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye.""The Los Angeles Times, the dominant news organization in the Southern California area where the Observer is located, has said the Observer is ""notorious for fake news."":Musk later deleted his tweet.'Break Her Kneecaps'Three days following the attack, The AP published new details about DePape. According to findings reported by federal authorities, the assailant told authorities that he had broken into the residence seeking to break Nancy Pelosi's kneecaps:The man accused of attacking House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband with a hammer told police he wanted to hold the Democratic leader hostage and ""break her kneecaps"" to show other members of Congress there were ""consequences for their actions,"" authorities said Monday.In a chilling federal complaint, officials say that David DePape, 42, carrying zip ties and tape in a backpack, broke into the couple's San Francisco home early Friday morning, went upstairs where 82-year-old Paul Pelosi was sleeping, and demanded to talk to ""Nancy.""When a surprised Paul Pelosi told the intruder she was not there, DePape said he would wait -- even after being told she would not be home for some days. The assailant then started taking out twist ties, to tie him up, the complaint says.The federal filing stands in contrast to the mocking jokes and conspiracy theories about the Pelosi attack circulating by far-right figures and even some leading Republicans just a week before the hard-fought midterm elections. The San Francisco district attorney and police chief both said the attack was intentional.:As of this writing on Oct. 31, Paul Pelosi remained hospitalized in San Francisco."
97,97,606.GovernmentBuriesWeat,"Claim:The government buried news of weather modification in the classifieds section of a small newspaper.Rating:Mostly FalseAbout this rating What's TrueThe Los Angeles Department of Public Works (DPW) placed classified ads in the Pasadena Star News in early 2016 notifying locals about upcoming cloud seeding equipment installations.What's FalseThe only way residents could learn of the program was via a hard to find classified ad; the media ignored the announcement; cloud seeding is a shadowy and sinister form of weather modification somehow linked to chemtrails.:On 12 March 2016, the web site Wakeup World (described as news pertaining to the ""energetic organism we call Earth, the Universe and the Multiverse"") published a blog post claiming the American government ""quietly"" admitted to engaging in ""weather modification"" activities in a notice buried in the classifieds section of a small California newspaper:... the level of propaganda and indoctrination that the average American must wade through in order to get the smallest amount of Truth is staggering. We have reached a point in which Americans are so overwhelmed with the current battle taking place between the Alternative News community and mainstream media, and its barrage of contradicting ""Facts,"" that most have simply chosen to completely remove themselves from any critical thinking. Even when the government itself reveals an age-old lie to be true, most are so indoctrinated with the idea of the ""conspiracy"" that they convince themselves that the revelation is just another trick of those deceptive ""conspiracy theorists."" ... A perfect example of this is weather modification.Weather modification, geoengineering, chemtrails; these are all topics that if brought up in most circles today, would garner the speaker the telltale look that most Truthers have become all too familiar with. It is a look that has been ingrained into all who have opted to cast aside their critical thinking for their comforting daily lie. There is a herd mentality that has been established that causes even those on the fence or those interested in ""outside the box"" ideas, to fall in line while surrounded by the docile mass. So when the government recently released a ""Notice of Intent"" on page 11 of the Pasadena Star Classifieds, announcing their plan to carry out weather modification in Los Angeles County, it became clear that those blank stares should be turned inward, for some much needed self-reflection and re-evaluation.:The post included photographs of early 2016 classified ads placed by Los Angeles County's Department of Public Works (DPW) in the Pasadena Star News::The blog went on to assert that the odd venue for announcement was clearly an attempt to bury the information from the public, particularly sharper folks who'd kept an eye on such developments over the years:Obviously the appropriate area of the paper to release such a controversial topic is the classifieds, where it will no doubt be noticed by all. Sarcasm aside, it is clear they did not want anyone to take notice of this declaration of weather manipulation that has been fervently denied up until last year.However, the Los Angeles DPW devoted an entire page to the activity (cloud seeding) mentioned in the classified  [PDF]. That document explained cloud seeding was an anti-drought measure practiced intermittently for more than half a century in Los Angeles:Yes, since in the 1950's the County of Los Angeles has conducted cloud seeding activities in order to augment local water supplies. When there is abundant rain or major fires affect the targeted watersheds, cloud seeding is temporarily halted.Public Works last had a cloud seeding contract in 2009 with North American Weather Consultants, Incorporated.:Also addressed was the classified ad, which was not new in 2016:A Public Notice of the Draft Mitigated Negative Declaration (DMND) was published in the Los Angeles Daily News, Los Angeles Times, Pasadena Star News, and San Gabriel Valley Tribune newspapers on July 24, 2009. Copies of the DMND were also sent to 8 cities and 11 local libraries ... A Notice of Intent was published in the San Gabriel Valley Tribune, Pasadena Star, and Los Angeles Daily newspapers from January 22 through February 5, 2016.The FAQ also discussed concerns about safety and chemtrails, noting that data was collected on cloud seeding from the 1950s onward. Regarding chemtrails, the DPW said:There is no evidence of any connection between cloud seeding and chemical trails (chemtrails). Atmospheric scientists use the term ""contrails"" which are defined as trails of condensed water vapor created by an engine at high altitudes. These trails are the result of normal emissions of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and some carbon-containing particulates. Contrails are normally observed on otherwise clear days, when cloud seeding would not be conducted. Cloud seeding sources do not produce such visible clouds.:Per the original blog post (which gained additional traction via the unreliable Facebook page ""The Mind Unleashed""), government officials sought to hide the cloud seeding initiative by placing news of it in a single classified ads section. However, the DPW stated that the same ad appeared in multiple Los Angeles-area newspapers.First, the story wasn't restricted to the classifieds. On the same date the blog post was published warning of this secret classifieds-only initiative CBS News covered cloud seeding in Los Angeles, as did KNSD and Gizmodo (on 9 March 2016); The Weather Channel (on 10 March 2016) KCAL (on 11 March 2016); and the Los Angeles Times (all the way back on 8 March 2016).Moreover, the claim that the government ""fervently"" denied such programs until the 2016 classified ad appeared was easily proved false. The National Center for Atmospheric Research and University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (NCAR and UCAR) published a fact sheet in 2008, Scientific American and U.S. News and World Report covered cloud seeding in 2009, ABC News reported on it way back in 2002, and the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) released a fact sheet in 2001. It would be difficult for anyone with a consistent interest in cloud seeding to miss news and information published widely over the years; the conspiracy's core claims relied on an audience that was to-date unfamiliar with the practice wholesale.:So while it was true Los Angeles' DPW announced cloud seeding plans via classified ads in early 2016, the disclosure was neither ""quiet"" nor novel in 2016; cloud seeding in the area occurred intermittently and openly beginning in the 1950s. Moreover, the 12 March 2016 blog post claiming that the program was a subtle admission (validating long-held suspicions) neglected to mention widespread media coverage across several high-profile sites in the days prior to its publication. Focusing on one of several classified ads provided the inaccurate impression that the program was largely secretive in nature, but information was easily obtained via both the DPW's web site and in contemporaneous news coverage."
98,98,223.HaveLeakedDocumentsB,"Claim:The ""Wall Street Journal"" (or another large news outlet) has published documents leaked from Walter Reed Medical Center which show President Donald Trump's ""true"" weight and prove a conspiracy to mislead the public.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In January 2018, the White House published the results of a routine medical examination performed on President Donald Trump by his then physician, Navy Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson, at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. :Some observers greeted the details of the ""periodic physical exam"" with skepticism, expressing doubt about Trump's weight, in particular, which Jackson listed as being 239 pounds, and his height, which he listed as 6'3"".This skepticism, which often comes from individuals who are otherwise critical of the president and his policies, and part of the loosely-defined anti-Trump ""Resistance,"" has coalesced online into a self-described ""Girther"" movement, a reference to the ""Birther"" conspiracy theory which surrounded former president Barack Obama and which was championed by Trump himself.In late April, Jackson was embroiled in controversy after reports emerged of an alleged pattern of drinking to excess while at work, overprescribing medication, and harassing colleagues. As a result of these allegations, Jackson withdrew from consideration for Veterans Affairs Secretary, a position for which Trump had nominated him. Around the same time, the ""Girther"" movement crystalized into a full-blown conspiracy theory, claiming corrupt practices by the president in nominating Jackson for a cabinet position in return for the favor of -- according to the theory -- lying about his vital statistics.  In the midst of all this innuendo and outright allegation, a viral meme emerged which appeared to some to be the smoking gun. Although the exact wording has varied, the meme typically reads as follows::BREAKING NEWS from [the Wall Street Journal], leaked documents from Walter Reed Hospital shows [sic] [the President of the United States] weight is 289 lbs, [blood pressure] is 154/91, cholesterol is 237. Not quite the healthy person we were told. At 71, Trump could drop dead any time. BREAKING NEWS from WSJ, leaked documents from Walter Reed Hospital shows @POTUS weight is 289 lbs, BP is 154/91, cholesterol is 237. Not quite the healthy person we were told. At 71, #Trump could drop dead any time. pic.twitter.com/rbyAUyVsXi-- Tomthunkit(tm) (@TomthunkitsMind) May 13, 2018In reality, the Wall Street Journal has not published any leaked documents from Walter Reed regarding Trump's physical condition. Presidents of the United States are under no legal obligation to make their private health records public, but occupants of the White House (as well as candidates) typically agree to do so as a matter of convention. :For someone who has custody over a sitting president's medical records to disclose those records without the consent of the president would most likely be a serious violation of HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, a 1996 law signed by then-president Bill Clinton. HIPAA states:A person who knowingly and in violation of this part --(1) uses or causes to be used a unique health identifier;(2) obtains individually identifiable health information relating to an individual; or(3) discloses individually identifiable health information to another personshall......(1) be fined not more than $50,000, imprisoned not more than one year, or both;(2) if the offense is committed under false pretenses, be fined not more than $100,000, imprisoned not more than five years, or both; and(3) if the offense is committed with intend to sell, transfer or use individually identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm, be fined not more than $250,000, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.There is absolutely no evidence that anyone has done this with Trump's private medical records, nor that the president's physical condition was not accurately described in Jackson's January 2018 examination report. The Wall Street Journal has certainly not published anything resembling a ""leak"" of Trump's ""true"" physical examination. :Those who attempt to attack the credibility of Trump's officially-recorded weight by comparing photographs of the president with elite athletes are basing their skepticism on false assumptions about the relationship between height, weight and body fat. Body shapes and types vary from person to person, based on several factors, and not everyone who weighs 239 pounds and is 6'3"" has a muscular build, or is required to have one in order to meet that weight at that height.Dr. Martin Binks is an associate professor of nutritional sciences at Texas Tech University and an expert in obesity and metabolism. While he did not specifically address the case of President Donald Trump, Binks explained the science to us:Observations of weight status made based on a fully clothed individual's appearance are inappropriate...""Appearance"", when it comes to body composition and health risk, is basically useless (as is weight). Two people of equal height and weight may have vastly different body composition based on relative differences in body fat, bone density, muscle and water retention.Weight by itself is not a ""meaningful gauge"" of a person's health, Binks added, and sometimes fat deposits that are not visible to the casual observer can be more strongly associated with health risks than are visible ones::Visceral fat deposits -- those for example surrounding and within organs, typically beneath the muscle -- are associated with greater health risk. Yet someone may appear to have considerable visible body fat (subcutaneous) immediately beneath the skin, which is associated less strongly with health risk.Not only is there no evidence of a conspiracy to suppress the president's ""true"" weight and mislead the American public, but the ""Girther"" theory is based on a fundamentally flawed understanding of how the human body can vary from person to person.

99,99,17.HeSpentTheirBloodLik,"Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.Three weeks before Election Day in 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump promoted a gruesome, incoherent, and baseless conspiracy theory that holds that his Democratic opponent Joe Biden had orchestrated the killings of U.S. special forces involved in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.According to the theory, Biden ordered the deaths either to keep the members of ""Seal Team Six"" from disclosing that the raid was a sham that had killed only bin Laden's ""double,"" or as a form of ""blood sacrifice"" to Iran, in return for the silence of Iranian officials on the ""true"" nature of the May 2011 operation in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Trump's tweets marked yet another extraordinary departure from the norms of political campaign rhetoric, by a president who trailed his rival by more than 10 points in national polls, and who had previously promoted a tweet that falsely labeled  Biden a ""pedophile."":At an NBC town hall event on Oct. 16, host Savannah Guthrie asked Trump why he had promoted the ""Seal Team Six"" conspiracy theory to his 87 million Twitter followers, to which the president replied, ""I know nothing about it, that was a retweet, that was an opinion of somebody, and that was a retweet. I put it out there, people can decide for themselves, I don't take a position.""Snopes asked the White House and Trump's reelection campaign whether the president believed that bin Laden was actually dead, or if he shared the view that Biden had deliberately arranged the assassinations of several members of the fabled ""Seal Team Six."" Remarkably, we did not receive a response to those requests for clarification.What Trump 'Put Out There'Trump promoted the conspiracy theory twice on Oct. 13. First, he retweeted a post by the account @The171111 that claimed ""Hiden Biden and Obama may have had Seal Team 6 killed!"" and linked to an article on the website DJHJ Media. The headline read: ""EXPLOSIVE: CIA Whistleblower Exposes Biden's Alleged Role With the Deaths of Seal Team - Claims to Have Documented Proof."":: Shortly afterward, Twitter permanently banned @The171111 for what a company spokesperson told Snopes was a violation of its ""ban evasion"" policy.The DJHJ Media article uncritically presented, and included partial transcripts of, an interview conducted by Alan Howell Parrot, a Maine falconer, with Nick Noe, who describes himself as a U.S. Air Force veteran and is presented by supporters as a ""Benghazi whistleblower,"" and Charles Woods, the father of Tyrone Woods, a former Navy SEAL who later served as a CIA contract protective officer and was killed in September 2012 while protecting the CIA base in Benghazi, Libya.The full video of that Oct. 12 interview can be viewed here. It was posted to YouTube by Anna Khait, a former professional poker player who took part in Season 32 of the reality television show ""Survivor,"" previously wrote for The Epoch Times and, as of 2019, worked as a real estate agent in New York. She was prominent in pushing Parrot and Noe's conspiracy theories on Twitter in October 2020.:A summary of the claims made by Parrot, both in that Oct. 12 interview, and in the 2010 documentary film ""Feathered Cocaine"", is available here. We'll examine the most significant ones in detail farther down.:Later on Oct. 13, Trump promoted a tweet by @VFL2013 that was a retweet of a post by @HeshmatAlavi. It contained the following text:Benghazi whistleblower Nick Noe-three former CIA Directors involved in keeping bin Laden alive in Iran, moved him from Iran to Pakistan for Obama's trophy kill-Payments to Iran were related.@HeshmatAlavi's tweet also featured a two-minute video clip of Noe and a link to the longer, original video. In the short clip promoted by Trump, Noe repeats Parrot's claim that three CIA directors were responsible for arranging Osama bin Laden's peaceful house arrest in Iran for several years. He also repeats the claim that, despite Iran's offer to hand over bin Laden to American custody, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and others ""cooked up [a] plan"" to have bin Laden transferred to Pakistan ""for a trophy kill"" (i.e. in order that the Obama administration might receive acclaim for killing bin Laden). Noe also claims that the Obama administration's purported payments to Iran were related to the bin Laden raid and speculates that the man killed in the Abbottabad raid may have, in fact, been bin Laden's ""double."":Alan Howell Parrot Alan Howell Parrot, the director of The Union for the Conservation of Raptors holds a falcon at the premiere of ""Feathered Cocaine"" during The 2010 Tribeca Film Festival at Village East Cinema on April 23, 2010 in New York City. (Photo by Will Ragozzino/Getty Images for Tribeca Film Festival)Parrot, who pronounces his last name ""Par-oh"", has a colorful past. He was born in Bangor, Maine, in April 1955, and as of October 2020, he lives in the town of Hancock, Maine. In 2010, he was the subject of an Icelandic documentary film in which he recounted his life and career as a professional falconer, leaving the United States at the age of 18 and traveling to the Middle East to train, raise, and sell falcons to wealthy sheikhs, businessmen, and politicians. :In the late 1970s, he studied biology at Cornell University, converted to Sikhism at the age of 22, and has worn a turban ever since. In 1980, while living in Ithaca, New York, he legally changed his name from Alan Howell Parrot to Hari Har Singh Khalsa. During the 1980s, he began campaigning against the mistreatment and smuggling of falcons. He claims to have had a hand in the arrest of hundreds of falcon smugglers during Operation Falcon, a joint undercover investigation by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Canadian Wildlife Service, which culminated in 1984 and caused divisions in the higher echelons of North American falconry. One 1987 news report claimed Khalsa (Parrot) was ""widely disliked in the falconry world,"" and in 1990, the Los Angeles Times reported that he had been responsible for informing on two prominent falconers. It quoted Khalsa as saying:""I have worked very hard to put my competition out of business. Every one of my competitors is terrified of me. I am ruthless. I don't care if they hate me. If you were pulling a big scam and I was yelling about it, you'd hate me, too."":In 1992, while living in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Khalsa legally changed his name back to Alan Howell Parrot. Since 2004, Parrot has been president of the Union for the Conservation of Raptors, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that aims to combat falcon smuggling, in particular among wealthy Middle Eastern businessmen and politicians.The Conspiracy TheoryAs we have mentioned, Parrot has made a variety of other claims about successive U.S. governments' policy toward bin Laden, but the following analysis will focus specifically on the Seal Team Six conspiracy theory, since that was the subject of several inquiries from Snopes readers in October 2020. It was also an allegation which, if it took hold, had the potential to make an impact on the 2020 presidential election.The claim that Biden was personally responsible for ordering the slayings of Seal Team Six members is without merit.:The official U.S. government version of events is by now well known, and summaries can be found here and here. In brief, the U.S. intelligence community identified a courier known to bin Laden, which then led them to a suspicious compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. From there, they used various methods to gather information on the layout of the compound and to ascertain bin Laden's presence within it.A small team of special forces planned and carried out the raid in the early hours of May 2, 2011, local time. Although official policy is to not provide certain details on special forces operations, it has been widely reported, and never disputed by government or military officials, that the Abbottabad raid was executed by members of the Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU, more commonly known as ""Seal Team Six"").According to the official version of events, Seal Team Six found bin Laden and shot him dead, after he provided resistance, within nine minutes of entering the compound. U.S. forces also killed three other adult males in what was described as a firefight. Bin Laden's body was positively identified and he was buried at sea. :By contrast, Parrot has claimed, without presenting evidence, that a Pakistani-Iranian double agent tipped off bin Laden about the impending U.S. assault on the compound, and Bin Laden was moved ""at the 11th hour"" and replaced with a ""double,"" who was subsequently shot dead. In order to prevent Iran from revealing this embarrassing and damaging secret, the Obama administration paid them $152 billion, according to Parrot.Parrot also claimed that Biden ""paid with the blood of Seal Team Six when he had them killed,"" suggesting that those deaths were ordered as a kind of ""blood sacrifice,"" to accompany the $152 billion payment to Iran. However, in his Oct. 12 interview, Parrot also indicated that Biden orchestrated the deaths of Seal Team Six in order to ensure their silence about the Abbottabad raid. Snopes asked Parrot to provide clarification on this point, but he declined to do so.The following is a summary of some of the major factual and logical problems with the conspiracy theory promoted repeatedly by Trump in October 2020, a theory he later said he ""put out there"" for public consumption::No evidence exists to show that any of the Seal Team Six members who took part in the bin Laden raid are even dead, and convincing evidence exists to the contrary. Robert O'Neill speaks onstage during book signing and lecture at Richard Nixon Library on July 26, 2017, in Yorba Linda, California. (Photo by Phillip Faraone/Getty Images):Two individuals widely understood to have taken part in the killing of bin Laden -- Robert O'Neill and Matt Bissonnette -- have spoken publicly about their respective roles in the Abbottabad raid. No government or military official has ever disputed their claimed participation in the mission that killed bin Laden. In 2016, the U.S. government sued Bissonnette over his failure to submit his memoir, ""No Easy Day,"" for pre-publication review by the Defense Department. In court filings that were not contested by the government, Bissonnette and his attorneys described him as a former Navy SEAL who took part in the Abbottabad mission.In 2014, as O'Neill was preparing to do a high-profile interview with Fox News, Rear Admiral Brian Losey, head of U.S. Naval Special Warfare Command, and Naval Special Warfare Force Master Michael Magaraci co-signed a letter that contained thinly veiled criticisms of O'Neill and Bissonnette, writing: A critical [tenet] of our ethos is ""I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions."" Our ethos is a life-long commitment and obligation, both in and out of the Service. Violators of our ethos are neither teammates in good standing, nor teammates who represent Naval Special Warfare. We do not abide willful or selfish disregard for our core values in return for public notoriety and financial gain, which only diminishes otherwise honorable service, courage and sacrifice. :Although Losey and Magaraci did not name O'Neill and Bissonnette in the letter, the context makes it clear that they were their intended targets, and the letter therefore constitutes de facto confirmation of O'Neill and Bissonnette's roles in the bin Laden raid. Since O'Neill and Bissonnette are demonstrably still alive, the claim that Biden orchestrated the deaths of Seal Team Six members involved in the Abbottabad mission was demonstrably false. For his part, O'Neill himself responded to Parrot's claims on Twitter, writing: ""Every SEAL from the [bin Laden] mission is alive while you are reading this.""The theory appears to stitch together previously debunked claims, rather than being based on ""explosive"" new evidenceSnopes asked Parrot to explain how Biden had orchestrated the deaths of Seal Team Six, as well as requesting any evidence he had proving that any member of the bin Laden team was actually dead. Replying by email, Parrot said he was bound by federal law against ""misprision of treason,"" which makes it a crime to be aware of an act of treason and either conceal it, or fail to disclose it to a state or federal judge, a state governor, or the U.S. president. However, Parrot told Snopes he would be happy to present additional evidence to a congressional committee, ""after President Donald J. Trump is reelected."":In the absence of any explanation or supportive evidence from Parrot, the claim that Biden had arranged for the deaths of Seal Team Six strongly appears to be no more than a rehash of a years-old conspiracy theory that Snopes has already debunked. In May 2011, shortly after the announcement of the bin Laden raid, then-Vice President Joe Biden mentioned in a speech the involvement of Navy SEALs and the CIA in the operation, details that had already been publicly reported in several forums. On that basis, radio personality Jeffrey Kuhner bizarrely accused Biden of deliberately putting Seal Team Six members at risk (even though Biden never mentioned Seal Team Six), and causing the deaths of 15 Seal Team Six members who were killed in Afghanistan in August 2011, when Taliban forces shot down a U.S. Chinook helicopter.Neither Kuhner, nor anyone else, has ever explained how Biden was personally, directly responsible for the deaths of those Seal Team Six members by being one of several individuals to mention the involvement of Navy SEALs in the bin Laden raid, without specifying the involvement of Seal Team Six, or how anything Biden said or did informed the Taliban of the fact that the helicopter in question had 15 Seal Team Six members on board, along with 23 other U.S. military forces and civilians, all of whom were killed.:The theory has even less credibility when one bears in mind that ""Seal Team Six"" had nearly 2,000 members, as of 2015, and the SEALs killed in August 2011 were, in any case, widely reported to have come from ""Gold Squadron,"" and those involved in the bin Laden raid three months earlier were widely reported to have come from ""Red Squadron.""A further nail in the coffin of the theory is the fact that the Taliban shot down the Chinook transport helicopter in the context of a U.S. assault on Taliban forces in the Tangi Valley, in Wardak Province, Afghanistan. To suggest that the Taliban shot down the helicopter specifically or exclusively based on information made public by Biden requires believing not only that they somehow knew it had Seal Team Six members on board, but also that they knew those members had taken part in the bin Laden raid (even though they came from an entirely different squadron within Seal Team Six), and that the Taliban would not have fired upon any U.S. military helicopter in that area at that time because they were under attack. This aspect of the theory is therefore logically incoherent as well as inaccurate. Similarly, the claim that the Obama administration had paid $152 billion in order to prevent Iranian officials from disclosing the ""truth"" behind the Abbottabad raid appears to be based on another, old misrepresentation of the truth already debunked by Snopes. As we reported in January 2019::The $150 billion figure is an estimate of the value of Iranian assets that were unfrozen as a result of Iran's agreeing to the terms of the nuclear agreement reached with seven nations in 2015, including the U.S., an agreement formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. In other words, Iran gained access to assets that already belonged to them, assets that had been frozen in various financial institutions around the world due to sanctions imposed to curb Iran's nuclear program. But Iran didn't get $150 billion in cash, nor did they receive any money at all from U.S. taxpayers -- they only regained access to assets that had been frozen in several different countries (not just the U.S.), and the $150 billion figure was merely an upper estimate.Moreover, that $150 billion figure was the highest estimate of the value of Iran's frozen assets, with multiple sources reporting much lower figures. For example, Adam J. Szubin, Acting Under Secretary of Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, supplied written testimony to a U.S. Senate committee in August 2015 stating that U.S. assessment of the total liquid assets Iran would regain control of as a result of the nuclear agreement was ""a little more than $50 billion.""'I Don't Take a Position':Trump's Oct. 13 retweets constituted a promotion by the president of the United States, to his 87 million followers, of extraordinary, inflammatory and baseless allegations and conspiracy theories, aimed at his electoral rival, to which very few social media users would have been exposed, if not for his interventions. In light of the content of the theories promoted by Trump, it's worth clarifying his position on certain basic matters of fact and historical record. In 2012, the future president stated as fact that Navy SEALS had killed bin Laden, so it's not clear why, in October 2020, he promoted a conspiracy theory whose key premise was the exact opposite.  Snopes asked the White House and Trump's reelection campaign for eight straightforward clarifications. The following is an exact transcript of the questions we asked:- Does Pres. Trump believe that Osama Bin Laden is dead? Does he believe that he was killed by U.S. forces in Abbottabad, in May 2011?:- Does Pres. Trump accept the official version of events presented by the U.S. government, in relation to the mission to locate and capture/kill Osama Bin Laden? If not, what is his position on what happened?- Does Pres. Trump believe that former Vice President Biden was responsible for arranging the purported deaths of, or attacks upon, members of Seal Team 6, either in order to secure their silence about the ""true"" nature of the Abbottabad raid, or as a form of payment or ""blood sacrifice"" to Iran, in order to preserve Iran's silence as to the ""true"" nature of the Abbottabad raid?- Does Pres. Trump believe that payments made by the Obama administration to Iran were made in return for Iran's silence on the ""true"" nature of the Abbottabad raid?- Does Pres. Trump believe that John Brennan, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, or other Obama administration officials, knowingly allowed Osama Bin Laden to be held peacefully, under effective house arrest, in Iran, for several years after the 9/11 attacks?- Does Pres. Trump believe that Obama administration officials arranged for Osama Bin Laden's transfer to Pakistan, in order to allow for a later ""trophy kill"" orchestrated by the Obama administration?:- Does Pres. Trump believe that John Brennan is a Muslim?- If Pres. Trump, does not believe, support, endorse or agree with the claims made by Parrot and Noe, why did he promote those claims on his Twitter account on Oct. 13?Remarkably, neither the White House nor the Trump campaign provided a substantive response to any of those questions.

100,100,224.FBIAdmitsSandyHookHo,"On 25 September 2014, the conspiracy theories that sprang up following the Sandy Hook Elementary school massacre of December 2012 gained a bizarre new chapter, as the website InfoWars put forth a new claim. While the belief that the murders were a ""false flag"" attack is not novel, the site alleged that the FBI released a report proving that no one died that day in Newtown:Example:   [Collected via E-mail, September 2014]Saw an FBI report for Connecticut for 2012 that listed no murders in Newtown, Connecticut. What about the 23 children that were supposedly killed at Sandy Hook Elementary? Interesting don't you think!Sandy Hook hoax theories are legion, although they mostly circle back to the general idea that the massacre was staged to drum up support for an eventual massive revocation of the right to bear arms. In the intervening years, no such ""gun grabs"" have come to fruition or even been attempted; but the notion of a Newtown conspiracy remains deeply entrenched in some corners of the web.:The InfoWars post published in September 2014 drilled down on new crime data provided by the FBI, making a specific observation about the lack of murders tallied in Newtown, Connecticut for 2012. The site outlines the general conspiracy first, explaining:On December 14, 2012, the world watched in horror as the corporate media reported the deaths of 20 students and 6 staff members at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown at the hands of a deranged 20-year-old.Internet sleuths immediately took to the web to stitch together clues indicating the shooting could be a carefully-scripted false flag event, similar to the 9/11 terror attacks, the central tenet being that the event would be used to galvanize future support for gun control legislation. Two years later, and scores of politicians and gun control groups have cited the Sandy Hook incident as a pretext to curtail Americans' Second Amendment rights.It's worth noting that the narrative subtly implies the media was ""in on"" the ruse, colluding with authorities (and locals, and law enforcement, and politicians, naturally) to bamboozle Americans out of their guns. Notable also is the suggestion that conspiracy buffs were invested in rooting out subterfuge (whether it existed or not), as well as the suggestion that gun restrictions were a risk after the killings. (No major legislation was passed in response to the event.):The article goes on to note that a separate mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado in appear in FBI statistics, adding:In contrast to the Connecticut report, the 2012 FBI crime report for the state of Colorado shows that 29 murders occurred in the town of Aurora that year, a figure which takes into account the number of people who died in the Century Theater during the premiere of Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight film.Finally, and somewhat nonsensically, the site concludes that the FBI report is proof positive Sandy Hook was staged::While those who question the official Sandy Hook story have largely been marginalized, the FBI's own data is now seemingly substantiating their theories.Of course, had the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting been staged deliberately to separate Americans from their guns, one would expect the FBI to be complicit. Should the statistics for crime in Newtown inadvertently reveal a conspiracy of heretofore unimaginable scope, that agency need only explain its oversight as a clerical error, which has not happened.As it turns out, a recordkeeping anomaly of sorts is at the root of the FBI report's dissonant statistics for the Sandy Hook massacre. If you followed news of the incident at the time, you may recall that Connecticut State Police (not local city or town police) managed the crime scene in the hours, days, and weeks after the event in Newtown. Accordingly, the Sandy Hook Elementary victims were included in Connecticut's statewide records, but they were not tallied as crimes of any description in Newtown in 2012. Rather, the deaths were classified under ""State Police Misc."" in separate records.:Although the state's murder total was 146 that year, only 110 of those deaths were assigned to specific local jurisdictions in the FBI report. The statewide tally of 146 includes the 27 victims of the Sandy Hook massacre."

The original photograph was taken on 6 February 1972 and showed the crew of Apollo 16, Lunar Module Pilot Charles M. Duke, Commander John W. Young, and Command Module Pilot Thomas K. Mattingly II, during a training exercise at the Kennedy Space Center::It wasn't until about two months later, on 21 April 1972, that these astronauts touched down on the surface of the moon. On that occasion, they wore their helmets::On April 16, 1972, the sixth manned lunar landing mission, Apollo 16, launched from Kennedy Space Center, Fla. on its way to conduct scientific investigations on the Moon's Descartes highlands. The mission was also the first usage of the Moon as an astronomical observatory with the use of the ultraviolet camera/spectrograph which photographed ultraviolet light emitted by Earth and other celestial objects. In this photo taken by lunar module pilot Charles M. Duke, commander of the Apollo 16 lunar landing mission, John W. Young, salutes the United States flag during the mission's first extravehicular activity. Both the Lunar Module (LM) ""Orion"" and the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) can be seen in the background.

102,102,451.Did50KBallotsSuspici,"Claim:Poll workers in Georgia's Senate runoff election illegally uncovered 50,000 ballots in the early morning hours of Jan. 6, 2021.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Shortly after Democrat Raphael Warnock was announced the winner of one of Georgia's two Senate runoff races on Jan. 6, 2021, putting the Senate majority within the party's reach, U.S. President Donald Trump attempted to cast doubt on the integrity of the election by claiming poll workers mysteriously uncovered 50,000 ballots overnight. He said in a tweet::They just happened to find 50,000 ballots late last night. The USA is embarrassed by fools. Our Election Process is worse than that of third world countries.The post was part of the president's long-spanning misinformation campaign (including the above-displayed tweet) to convince Americans of an illicit, coordinated scheme by Trump's political enemies to undermine him, even though nothing of the sort was taking place.:Snopes debunked similar assertions by Trump that secretive late-night vote ""dumps"" helped his opponent in the 2020 presidential election, Democrat Joe Biden, win key battleground states.As was the case then, Georgia voters' heavy reliance on mail-in voting instead of in-person polls -- to reduce the risk of catching COVID-19 -- increased the chances of voting results shifting significantly late at night, as poll workers counted more ballots. That phenomenon was not a result of a conspiracy against Trump, but rather a product of a Georgia law that prohibits poll workers from counting any ballots until after polls close.The Associated Press reported on Jan. 4, the day before the special election:Absentee ballots must be received by the close of polls to be counted. Military and overseas ballots postmarked by Tuesday and received by Friday will be counted, and absentee voters also have until Friday to fix any problems so their votes can be counted.No ballots, including absentee ballots received in advance of Election Day, can be counted until the polls close. [...]In a close contest, look for the Republican candidate to jump out to an early lead. That due to two factors: First, Republican areas of the state usually report their results first. Second, Republican voters have been more likely to vote in person, either on Election Day or during the early voting period. Many counties release those in-person results first.Meanwhile, heavily Democratic counties, including Fulton, DeKalb and Chatham counties, historically take longer to count votes. :In regards to the president's assertion regarding a ""dump"" of 50,000 ballots to supposedly undermine Republican candidates Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, specifically, Snopes found no evidence to support the allegation of voter fraud, and Georgia election officials refuted such claims. ""Election Day for the Georgia Senate runoffs has progressed with few issues and almost nonexistent wait times,"" the Georgia Secretary of State said in a news release.Below is our evidence for that conclusion.Just hours after polls closed, some elections officials statewide finished processing and tabulating ballots, and the public learned which candidate received the majority of votes in those counties. Meanwhile, ballot counting in other precincts remained ongoing.The Atlanta Journal Constitution reported at 9:30 p.m.::It's still early, but Republicans are increasingly antsy about their chances. Early returns are showing U.S. Sen. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue underperforming in important GOP strongholds in rural areas and the exurbs.And turnout in Democratic bastions is nearing November general election levels in some left-leaning rural counties that have already reported most of their results.By 11 p.m., the newspaper said, election workers had tallied more than 300,000 votes, and only a small number of precincts were outstanding. Shortly afterwards, as Atlanta's DeKalb County uploaded its voter tallies, some news outlets, including Vox, declared Warnock the winner. He led Loeffler by about 37,000 votes, with 97% precincts reporting, according to the AJC.""Of the outstanding votes left to count, many were expected to come in from Democratic strongholds in DeKalb and Fulton counties,"" the newspaper reported. At 12:49 a.m., NBC was the first major news network to announce Loeffler had no statistical chance of overcoming Warnock's margin of victory. National news outlets including The Associated Press, CNN, and ABC News quickly followed suit.:At 2 a.m. the AJC reported Fulton County election officials were calling it a night and preparing to count the last rounds of ballots in the morning. In all, about 25,000 mail-in ballots remained uncounted across the state, with the bulk in the Atlanta metro area, according to preliminary estimates from the Secretary of State's office.:In other words, voting spikes occurred over the course of hours, late at night, for predictable reasons. Counting in multiple Democratic strongholds, as well as several smaller and more conservative-leaning counties, resumed by 6:45 a.m. on Jan. 6, according to the newspaper.Shortly after the president's tweet about poll workers nefariously ""finding"" 50,000 ballots, Gabriel Sterling, a Republican who oversees voting systems for the secretary of state's office, highlighted evidence showing typical voter returns based on the state's estimated number of absentee voters. He said in a tweet:No Mr. President, there weren't ""found"" ballots. We have known the number of advanced votes since this weekend. We saw record Election Day turnout. As of Monday 970,000 absentees had been accepted. 31k more were added in yesterday's totals. That leaves 60k that came in yesterday.:In sum, considering Sterling's direct refutation of Trump's claim, as well as the fact that no evidence exists to prove the president's conspiracy theory about 50,000 ballots, and all proof showed predictable vote-counting processes in the early morning hours of Jan. 6, we rate this claim ""false."""
103,103,667.HasBillBarrBeenAppoi,"Claim:U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr was appointed to serve on the board of a company that owns, operates, or is in some way related to Dominion Voting Systems.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.In an ongoing campaign to sow doubt about the validity of the 2020 presidential election, hardcore supporters of outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump and related QAnon conspiracy theorists have suggested a corrupt connection between U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr and the company Dominion Voting Systems. Dominion has been a subject of myriad debunked conspiracy theories regarding ""flipped votes,"" and in late November 2020 Barr became the target of Trumpist scorn after he stated he had seen no evidence of widespread voter fraud::The allegation is that Barr was appointed to serve on, and currently is a member of, the board of directors for Dominion. This is flawed for several reasons, but a fairly central problem is that a news release that accompanied the above tweet refers to the Virginia-based Energy behemoth Dominion Energy Services, Inc., which has nothing whatsoever to do with the company Dominion Voting Services.:It is true that Barr was elected to serve on the board of directors of Dominion Energy. This occurred over a decade ago, in December 2009. In February 2019, when Barr was confirmed as Trump's attorney general, he resigned that position, as noted in a company news release:The company ... announced the resignation from the board of William P. Barr, effective Feb. 12, 2019. Barr was nominated by President Donald Trump in December to be U.S. Attorney General, and he was confirmed today. Barr joined Dominion Energy's board in 2009 and chaired the Compensation, Governance and Nominating Committee at the time of his resignation.It is not true, however, that Dominion Energy is related to Dominion Voting. An attempt at making this connection focused on the false assertion that Dominion Voting Services is or was one of the ""over 240"" subsidiaries of Dominion Energy. Indeed, Dominion Energy, Inc. owns several subsidiaries, but Dominion Voting Services -- or any election-related company -- is not one of them, according to their most recent SEC filings.:As there is no connection outside of the shared use of the word ""Dominion"" in their company's name, there is also no connection -- even an out-of-date one -- between Barr and Dominion Voting Systems. The claim therefore is ""False."""

Chase told us that this letter was sent in error. :In late August 2021, an image started circulating on social media that supposedly showed a letter issued by Chase Bank informing retired Gen. Michael Flynn that his credit cards had been canceled due to a ""reputational risk"":This is a genuine letter sent from Chase to a member of the Flynn family. The first name on this letter has been redacted so we can't say with certainty that this letter was addressed to Gen. Flynn. A spokesperson for Chase confirmed to us that this letter was real, but added that it was sent by mistake and that this person's credit cards would not actually be closed. :A spokesperson for Chase told us: ""We've contacted our customer to let her know that we made an error and we apologized for any inconvenience this caused.""The Chase spokesperson's use of the pronoun ""her"" leads us to believe that this letter may not have been sent to Flynn himself, but to another member of his family. The spokesperson did not elaborate.Where Did the Image of This Letter Originate?Many people encountered this letter as it was circulated on Twitter by third-party accounts. As this letter wasn't shared on the platform under Flynn's own handle (Flynn has been banned from Twitter since January 2021), it left people wondering if this letter was authentic. Disinformation researcher Jim Stewartson detailed the origins of the letter in a Twitter thread. According to Stewartson, this letter was originally shared on Telegram by Qanon influencer and recently elected South Carolina GOP official Tracy Diaz (@tracybeanz). The letter was deleted shortly after it was posted along with a message stating that there had been a ""miscommunication"" about making the letter public. However, the image continued to circulate and eventually Flynn posted two messages on Telegram that seemingly confirmed the authenticity of the letter.::We archived @RealGenFlynn's Telegram posts here and here. On Aug. 30, 2021, Flynn posted an update to the situation, thanking his followers for their support and praying that ""Chase Bank and all their cancel culture partners think twice about what they are doing to destroy the fabric of our constitution.""What Is 'Reputational Risk'?Banks assess a number of risk factors when deciding whether or not to do business with someone. For example, if a person has a criminal history of fraud they may find it difficult to get a credit card. Banks also look at reputational risk, or the impact that doing business with a person or company may have on the bank's reputation. Here's how the German multinational investment bank Deutsche Bank explains their approach to ""reputational risk."" The reputation of Deutsche Bank is founded on trust from its employees, clients, shareholders, regulators and from the public in general. Isolated events can undermine that trust and negatively impact Deutsche Bank's reputation and it is therefore of the utmost importance that it is protected, for which it is the responsibility of every employee of the Bank.Reputational risk at Deutsche Bank is defined as the risk of possible damage to Deutsche Bank's brand and reputation, and the associated risk to earnings, capital or liquidity arising from any association, action or inaction which could be perceived by stakeholders to be inappropriate, unethical or inconsistent with the Bank's values and beliefs. Reputational risk is governed by the Reputational Risk Framework, which was established to provide consistent standards for the identification, assessment and management of reputational risk issues.:Why Would Flynn Be a Reputational Risk?Assuming this letter is real, it's possible that Chase deemed Flynn a ""reputational risk"" as he pled guilty to lying to federal officials about his contacts with a Russian ambassador in 2017 (Flynn was later pardoned by former U.S. President Donald Trump), his statements in support of the QAnon conspiracy theory, or, more recently, his comments in June 2021 that seemingly encouraged people to stage a violent coup to overthrow the U.S. government. Flynn later released a statement saying that he has never advocated for a coup. It's also possible that Chase deemed Flynn a ""reputational risk"" due to questionable financial transactions. In 2017, for example, it was reported that Flynn's consulting firm received more than $500,000 from the Turkish government while Flynn was serving as Trump's national security adviser. The New York Times reported::The candidate he was advising last fall was running on a platform of America First. The client he was working for last fall was paying him more than $500,000 to put Turkey first.Michael T. Flynn, who went from the campaign trail to the White House as President Trump's first national security adviser, filed papers this week acknowledging that he worked as a foreign agent last year representing the interests of the Turkish government in a dispute with the United States.The viral image truly shows a letter that was sent from Chase Bank to Gen. Flynn's family regarding credits cards that were to be canceled due to reputational risk. A spokesperson for Chase confirmed the authenticity of the letter, but said that it had been sent in error and that the account would not be closed."

Price who as a leader of this highly specialized American Special Forces unit protects high-ranking diplomats traveling in Middle Eastern and Asian combat zones.As usual, this was just more of the typical WhatDoesItMean.com conspiracy nuttery, spun around the recent tragic suicide of Commander Job W. Price, the 42-year-old leader of U.S. Navy SEAL Team 4, who had killed himself with a pistol while deployed in Afghanistan a few days earlier.  And, as usual, the equally notorious and unreliable (but more professional looking) conspiracy-mongering European Union Times web site reprinted WhatDoesItMean.com's fabricated article about the secret plane crash.:The European Union Times' version of the fake article gained enough traction that it was eventually shared by a few U.S. military personnel and U.S. Department of State staffers via e-mail, prompting some confusion and chuckles among its recipients::That likely would have been the end of this fake article's brief lifespan, except for the fact that its having been forwarded via the Department of State's e-mail system meant it ended up being included among the archive of 30,322 e-mails sent to and from Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server while she was Secretary of State that were released online by WikiLeaks on 16 March 2016.Shortly after Hillary Clinton collapsed at 9/11 memorial service and spurred the renewal of rumors that she was suffering from, and concealing, a major medical ailment (purportedly of a neurological nature), several fringe political sites picked up on the confluence of the 2012 article's having recently appeared in a State Dept. e-mail leak and ran with the notion that the original four-year-old WhatDoesItMean.com fake news piece was true, that it proved that Clinton was covering up a serious plane crash injury that had left her ""unconscious and bleeding profusely,"" and that all of this had been ""verified"" by WikiLeaks:For years we have been given the story over and over again that Hillary Clinton is fine and she is perfectly healthy. The story line gradually morphed into Hillary ""fell"" and suffered a concussion, which then, in turn, led to brain clots. Well, color me NOT surprised but apparently that was all a lie told by a couple that wouldn't know the truth if it bit them!:WikiLeaks has released another round of emails exposing some MAJOR bombshells surrounding Hillary.

One of the members of that team was reportedly killed when the aircraft crash-landed. The government had previously claimed that Commander Job W. Price died of a possible ""suicide."" His death was listed as a non-combat related injury. Commander Price was a leader of this highly specialized American Special Forces unit. Their mission was to protect high-ranking diplomats traveling in Middle Eastern and Asian combat zones.US military flight logs recorded by Russian air and space forces confirm that Commander Price, and other members of US Navy Seal Team 4, left their base in Urozgan Province, Afghanistan on a flight to US Naval Support Activity Bahrain where they met up with the then-Secretary of State, Hillary, and all of them transferred to the C-12 Huron and proceeded to fly to Baghdad.:As we noted at the head of this article, the fantastic ""secret plane crash"" tale was a complete fabrication, and it appeared on WikiLeaks only because some State Department staffers had forwarded the article among themselves via-email.

(Note: We recognize that pedophilia, which is defined as a sexual attraction to children, is not the same as child sexual abuse, although the web sites under discussion do not observe that distinction.):A YourNewsWire story written by Dmitry Baxter (one of the promulgators of the thoroughly discredited ""Pizzagate"" conspiracy theory claiming in 2016 that Hillary Clinton and other ""Washington elites"" ran a pedophile ring out of a pizza restaurant in the nation's capitol) intimated that the reason Bieber canceled the last leg of his 2017 world tour in July was his realization that pedophilia is rampant in the entertainment business: Justin Bieber told hundreds of people at a Bible study class in Los Angeles that he has ""woken up"" to the ""evils of the music industry"" and he needs to take a break from the industry because it is ""controlled by the absolute worst kind of people -- pedophiles.""Bieber has become a regular at the Bible study class held at the Montage in Beverly Hills and on Saturday 22nd July he shared what he described as a ""horrific story"" with the congregation and explained why he felt he had to quit his world tour.Describing a party on tour -- attended by the upper echelon of the music business, including executive VPs of development, producers, power agents and international financiers -- Bieber said he was encouraged to sexually abuse a young child who had been bought to the party for the sexual gratification of the industry elite.:One day later, a similar article about Katy Perry was posted on the web site Neon Nettle (another hardcore purveyor of ""Pizzagate"" rumors, not to mention articles falsely attributing statements about show business pedophilia to actor Brad Pitt and implying connections between the deaths of alt-rockers Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington and music industry child abusers):In a shocking expose from one of the biggest pop stars in the world, Katy Perry has dealt a devastating blow to the entertainment world elite by revealing that the entire industry is ""controlled"" by ""sick pedophiles"".The ""I Kissed a Girl"" singer had left many concerned about her mental state following a series of public breakdowns earlier this year.She made headlines when she disclosed her suicidal tendencies and exhibited signs of a split personality disorder, saying ""I don't want to be Katy Perry anymore"".The article goes on to paint a picture virtually identical to that in the YourNewsWire article of industry pedophiles making up an ""exclusive club"": :Clearly troubled by the details, she told a group of close friends:""I can't live this life any longer. They're all pedophiles. What they do to these children is sick.""She continues to elaborate, visibly traumatized by the things she's witnessed:""And they're every where you go. It's like they're not even trying to hide it. They flaunt it like it's a badge of honor"" ""The producers, the executives, the big names...

Even the women.""""They say to me, 'Katy, you need to take the next step in your career', but there's no way I would do those things to kids.""Despite the fact that both stories include elements of truth to shore up their credibility -- Justin Bieber did cancel part of his 2017 tour, for example, and Katy Perry did say in a live-streamed therapy session that she doesn't want to be ""Katy Perry"" anymore (i.e., in the sense of having to live up to fans' expectations) -- in neither case are the statements attributed to them about pedophilia sufficiently sourced or corroborated to earn readers' credence. No such statements by Bieber and Perry have been quoted (or even mentioned) by any mainstream news outlets.:On the contrary, these statements are lurid fabrications designed either to garner social media likes and shares (and advertising dollars), or spread disinformation intended to harm the reputations of so-called ""Hollywood elites"" (a favorite political target of both YourNewsWire and Neon Nettle), or both.Unfortunately, by disseminating these false stories, the web sites dilute and lend confusion to the impact of actual claims of industry pedophilia made by the likes of former child actors Corey Feldman and Elijah Wood, who have separately gone on record saying the extent to which the sexual abuse of minors occurs in Hollywood is underreported.Worse, child abuse is one of those emotion-laden topics that can lead to violence, so there's no room for false reporting. One would hope that lessons were learned from the Pizzagate debacle, which resulted in a credulous fake news reader firing an AR-15 rifle inside Washington DC's Comet Ping Pong, a family restaurant; the shooter said he expected to rescue ""child sex slaves"" from a pedophile ring that does not exist, which was purportedly run out of the restaurant's basement, which also does not exist.:We reached out to representatives of Justin Bieber and Kate Perry for comment, but did not hear back before publication time."

We found an online source that sent a test message to Abedin's personal address during or before the first week of September 2016 -- which was when she supposedly sent the incriminating e-mail to her brother -- and reported that the message was returned as undeliverable, indicating that her account was no longer active."
109,109,423.WastheUSGovernmentFo,"Claim:The U.S. government was sued and found culpable for the murder of Martin Luther King, Jr., but the news media refused to report it.Rating:Mostly FalseAbout this rating Intermittently, rumors have circulated on social media holding that the United States government was found guilty in 1999 of conspiring to assassinate Martin Luther King, Jr. Furthermore, according to these rumors, the reason this relatively new information (King was murdered on 4 April 1968) comes as a surprise to many is the ""mainstream media"" intentionally suppressed it after the government's role in King's death was exposed::It's common for exaggerated claims to contain a few elements of truth, and that factor comes into play in this conspiracy theory rumor for a few reasons. One is rudimentary research would confirm the claim's basics (i.e., the verdict in a wrongful death civil action did allow that ""government agencies"" participated in a conspiracy to assassinate Dr. King), leading readers to believe the entirety of the rumor was factual. Another is the shaky foundation on which the conspiracy theory rests is a matter of some nuance. As well, the gravity of the trial's supposed conclusion, when contrasted with the relatively little public discussion of that addendum to King's life, has lent credence to the belief the trial in question and its outcome were deliberately omitted from the news.:Historical figures like Martin Luther King, Jr. tend to be the subject of complicated conspiracy theories, particularly when they are vectors for widespread societal change. The man who was charged with King's murder, James Earl Ray, confessed to the crime and pled guilty; he then recanted his confession, hinted at a conspiracy, and sought to withdraw his guilty plea and secure a trial. However, any claim made by Ray about his guilt or innocence should be weighed against his strong incentive to be freed from prison (where he died in 1998).Also at issue is the difference between Ray's guilty plea in 1969, which avoided his undergoing a criminal trial, and the case cited by the rumors, which was a civil trial heard in 1999. The latter (King vs. Jowers) was a civil suit brought by agents of King's estate (including his widow, Coretta Scott King) against a man named Loyd Jowers, who claimed to have taken part in a conspiracy to assassinate King. In a criminal trial the guilt of the defendant must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, but in a civil suit the plaintiff need only support his claim with a preponderance of evidence to prevail.Loyd Jowers was a Memphis restaurant owner who inserted himself into the narrative about King's death in the course of a 1993 television interview during which he claimed to have been party to a larger conspiracy to assassinate King. However, Jowers had long asserted he had no involvement in the event before suddenly and bizarrely claiming, twenty-five years after the fact, he had been paid to hire a hit man to kill Martin Luther King. He then repudiated his claims when required to testify to them under oath::At the time of the assassination, Loyd Jowers owned and operated Jim's Grill, a tavern below the rooming house where James Earl Ray rented a room on April 4, 1968. Until 1993, Jowers maintained in several public statements that he was merely serving customers in his tavern when Dr. King was shot. He did not claim any involvement in the assassination or significant knowledge about it.In December 1993, Jowers appeared on ABC's Prime Time Live and radically changed his story, claiming he participated in a plot to assassinate Dr. King. According to Jowers, a Memphis produce dealer, who was involved with the Mafia, gave him $100,000 to hire an assassin and assured him that the police would not be at the scene of the shooting. Jowers also reported that he hired a hit man to shoot Dr. King from behind Jim's Grill and received the murder weapon prior to the killing from someone with a name sounding like Raoul. Jowers further maintained that Ray did not shoot Dr. King and that he did not believe Ray knowingly participated in the conspiracy.Since his television appearance, Jowers and his attorney have given additional statements about the assassination to the media, the King family, Ray's defenders, law enforcement personnel, relatives, friends, and courts. Jowers, however, has never made his conspiracy claims under oath. In fact, he did not testify in King v. Jowers, despite the fact that he was the party being sued. The one time Jowers did testify under oath about his allegations in an earlier civil suit, Ray v. Jowers, he repudiated them. Further, he has also renounced his confessions in certain private conversations without his attorney. For example, in an impromptu, recorded conversation with a state investigator, Jowers characterized a central feature of his story -- that someone besides Ray shot Dr. King with a rifle other than the one recovered at the crime scene -- as ""bullshit."" Consequently, Jowers has only confessed in circumstances where candor has not been required by law or where he has not been required to reconcile his prior inconsistencies.:The U.S. Department of Justice found Jowers' claims were without merit and explained that he'd never been able to provide any support for later assertions about his involvement in King's death:When Jowers has confessed, he has contradicted himself on virtually every key point about the alleged conspiracy. For example, he not only identified two different people as the assassin, but also most recently claimed that he saw the assassin and did not recognize him. Jowers also abandoned his initial allegation that he received $100,000 with which he hired a hit man to kill Dr. King, claiming instead that he merely held the money for the conspirators. Additionally, Jowers has been inconsistent about other aspects of the alleged conspiracy, including his role in it, Raoul's responsibilities, whether and how Memphis police officers were involved, and the disposal of the alleged murder weapon.Furthermore, the Justice Department's investigation determined no physical evidence whatsoever supported Jowers' multiple and conflicting accounts of his involvement in King's assassination, and Jowers stood to profit from his assertions::It was not until 1993, during a meeting with the producer of a televised mock trial of James Earl Ray, that Jowers first publicly disclosed the details of the alleged plot, including the names of the purported assassin and other co-conspirators. He also initially sought compensation for his story, and his friends and relatives acknowledge that he hoped to make money from his account.In summary, we have determined that Jowers' claims about an alleged conspiracy are materially contradictory and unsubstantiated. Moreover, Jowers' repudiations, even under oath, his failure to testify during King v. Jowers, his refusal to cooperate with our investigation, his reported motive to make money from his claims, and his efforts along with his friends to promote his story all suggest a lack of credibility. We do not believe that Jowers, or those he accuses, participated in the assassination of Dr. King.Unfortunately, the jury who heard the case of King vs. Jowers (in which the King family was represented by James Earl Ray's former lawyer, William Pepper) returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, holding that Loyd Jowers had participated in a conspiracy to kill King, and that ""governmental agencies"" were party to the conspiracy::THE COURT: In answer to the question did Loyd Jowers participate in a conspiracy to do harm to Dr. Martin Luther King, your answer is yes. Do you also find that others, including governmental agencies, were parties to this conspiracy as alleged by the defendant? Your answer to that one is also yes. And the total amount of damages you find for the plaintiffs entitled to is one hundred dollars. Is that your verdict?THE JURY: Yes (In unison).However, the verdict was of no real significance given that virtually nothing was at stake (this was not a criminal trial, and the defendant was only being sued for a mere $100 and thus had little motivation for vigorously defending himself), allowing the King family to present a mostly unopposed version of events and guide the jury to return the verdict they desired. As noted in the New York Times' report of the verdict, the one-sided presentation of the case allowed for no other result:John Campbell, an assistant district attorney in Memphis, who was not part of the civil proceedings but was part of the criminal case against Mr. Ray, said, ""I'm not surprised by the verdict. This case overlooked so much contradictory evidence that never was presented, what other option did the jury have but to accept Mr. Pepper's version?""And Gerald Posner, whose recent book, ""Killing the Dream"" made the case that Mr. Ray was the killer, said, ""It distresses me greatly that the legal system was used in such a callous and farcical manner in Memphis. If the King family wanted a rubber stamp of their own view of the facts, they got it."":The Justice Department also found the evidence presented in the civil trial to be lacking in credibility:The evidence introduced in King v. Jowers to support various conspiracy allegations consisted of either inaccurate and incomplete information or unsubstantiated conjecture, supplied most often by sources, many unnamed, who did not testify. Important information from the historical record and our investigation contradicts and undermines it. When considered in light of all other available relevant facts, the trial's evidence fails to establish the existence of any conspiracy to kill Dr. King. The verdict presented by the parties and adopted by the jury is incompatible with the weight of all relevant information, much of which the jury never heard.All of this is therefore a very slender thread on which to hang the claim that the ""U.S. government was proved responsible for King's assassination."" (In the event, the verdict referred only to ""governmental agencies"" rather than the U.S. government specifically, a term that could include anything from local police to the CIA.) And contrary to the rumor's assertion, the 1999 civil case involving Jowers was widely reported by major news outlets at the time (including, as referenced above, the New York Times).:More to the point, however, Jowers (who didn't even testify) was the only named party in the civil suit brought by the King family, and the judgment awarded in that case was a paltry $100, widely described as a token award to mark the trial's outcome. No other parties (including any branches or agents of the United States Government) were named as defendants in King v. Jowers, and no identification was provided by Jowers of the purported other parties with whom he colluded to assassinate King. By all accounts, the two main parties involved, the King family and Jowers, had disparate goals served by the civil suit's outcome; and no substantive evidence was presented to establish any of the claims made by Jowers had any merit.In a statement about the 1999 civil suit, Coretta Scott King cited several unrelated and unspecified agents in her description of the parties she believed were responsible for her husband's murder:There is abundant evidence of a major high level conspiracy in the assassination of my husband, Martin Luther King, Jr. And the civil court's unanimous verdict has validated our belief. I wholeheartedly applaud the verdict of the jury and I feel that justice has been well served in their deliberations. This verdict is not only a great victory for my family, but also a great victory for America. It is a great victory for truth itself. It is important to know that this was a SWIFT verdict, delivered after about an hour of jury deliberation. The jury was clearly convinced by the extensive evidence that was presented during the trial that, in addition to Mr. Jowers, the conspiracy of the Mafia, local, state and federal government agencies, were deeply involved in the assassination of my husband. The jury also affirmed overwhelming evidence that identified someone else, not James Earl Ray, as the shooter, and that Mr. Ray was set up to take the blame. I want to make it clear that my family has no interest in retribution. Instead, our sole concern has been that the full truth of the assassination has been revealed and adjudicated in a court of law.:The one thing the conspiracy rumor correctly states is a 1999 civil trial reached a verdict that cited the existence of a conspiracy to assassinate Martin Luther King, Jr. What it neglects to mention is the relative worth of such a judgment: The verdict in question was civil rather than criminal, the sole named defendant was someone who stood to gain both publicity and money from repeating his claims, and the King family's motivation in bringing the suit was to validate their long-held suspicions a larger conspiracy was at play in the death of the civil rights leader. Given the minor sum of money awarded, a jury would have little incentive to not find in favor of an account supported by both sides of a flawed case.The U.S. Justice Department concluded in June 2000 the ""allegations originating with Loyd Jowers ... are not credible"":After reviewing all available materials from prior official investigations and other sources, including the evidence from King v. Jowers, and after conducting a year and a half of original investigation, we have concluded that the allegations originating with Loyd Jowers and Donald Wilson are not credible.We found no reliable evidence to support Jowers' allegations that he conspired with others to shoot Dr. King from behind Jim's Grill. In fact, credible evidence contradicting his allegations, as well as material inconsistencies among his accounts and his own repudiations of them, demonstrate that Jowers has not been truthful. Rather, it appears that Jowers contrived and promoted a sensational story of a plot to kill Dr. King.Questions and speculation may always surround the assassination of Dr. King and other national tragedies. Our investigation of these most recent allegations, as well as several exhaustive previous official investigations, found no reliable evidence that Dr. King was killed by conspirators who framed James Earl Ray. Nor have any of the conspiracy theories advanced in the last 30 years, including the Jowers and the Wilson allegations, survived critical examination.:"
110,110,400.WasaCarvingofaModern,"Claim:A 2,000-year-old carving of a figure riding a modern bicycle was found inside an ancient temple in India.Rating:MiscaptionedAbout this rating On 21 July 2018, a video purportedly showing a 2000-year-old carving of a man riding bicycle found inside of an ancient temple in India was posted to Facebook by Mohan Praveen, the host of the ""Phenomenal Travel Videos"" YouTube show.Praveen argued in a longer version of this video posted to his YouTube channel that this extraordinary finding was puzzling because the modern bicycle wasn't invented until the 19th century, but the temple in which a carving of a bicycle was found, the Panchavarnaswamy Temple, was built over 2,000 years ago.:Is this bicycle carving, as Praveen hypothesized in a tweet, evidence of an ""advanced ancient technology?""Praveen claimed that historians were attempting to discredit this miraculous finding by arguing that this ""ancient"" temple was actually constructed only a hundred years ago. After an unnecessarily long explanation of what the carving depicts (a man on a bike), Praveen asserted that the temple undeniably dates to at least the 7th century, long before the development of the modern bicycle:How was this carved in this ancient temple which is about 2,000 years old?Some have argued that this temple was entirely built just a hundred years ago. Since this is not an ancient temple, all these carvings are new and sculptors carved what they saw. There were bikes hundred years ago so it was easy for sculptors to carve this. Are experts right about this? Is it possible that this is a new temple built in the last century? No, because this temple is mentioned in the 7th century text called Tevaram.:The experts that we've encountered, however, haven't argued that this ""temple was entirely built just a hundred years ago."" Rather, they've argued that specific portions of this 2,000-year-old temple were renovated about a hundred years ago, and that a sculptor working on those relatively modern renovations added the carving of a by-now-common bicycle at that time.In 2015, long before this carving was presented as an ""unexplained"" marking on an ancient temple in a variety of clickbait articles, Dr. R. Kalaikovan provided a much more logical explanation for it to The Hindu:""After the prayer, while taking a look around, I came across the carving of a bicycle on a pillar behind the Amman temple,"" says Dr. Kalaikovan. ""It was so funny and intriguing to see the picture of a cycle in an ancient temple. But neither the officials nor the scholar who wrote its history, were able to explain how it came there. I started researching this fact.""Through multiple forays into the history of the bicycle (which was invented in Germany in 1800s), and the Chola-era Woraiyur temple, he theorised that the vehicle was possibly a novelty in Tiruchi of the 1920s, when the temple had been renovated. ""Perhaps the sculptor had seen someone on a cycle, was impressed by it and had recorded it forever on stone,"" says Dr. Kalaikovan.:This isn't the first time that the ""discovery"" of a depiction of a modern object on the walls of an ancient structure has served as fodder for a conspiracy theory. Photographs showing a carving of an astronaut on the wall of a 12th century Spanish cathedral have been circulating for years along with theories about the ""unexplained"" phenomena. However, as was the case with this bicycle carving, the ""ancient astronaut"" was added to the cathedral during a renovation conducted in the 1990s. A carving of an ""ancient alien cellphone"" was similarly found to be the work of a modern artist."
111,111,594.Did41SenatorsVotetoL,"Claim:In 2019 and 2020, Democratic and Independent U.S. Senators voted to allow health care practitioners to let babies die, untreated, if born alive after an abortion.Rating:Mostly FalseAbout this rating What's TrueBy voting to block Senate Bill 311, Democratic and Independent U.S. senators prevented the advancement of a bill that would insert into federal law a uniform, nationwide obligation on health care practitioners to provide medical care to babies born alive after failed abortions and introduce uniform, nationwide criminal penalties for failing to uphold those obligations. What's FalseIn explaining their reasons for voting against the bill, senators did not express indifference to the fate of newborn babies, but rather argued that the bill was legally unnecessary (existing federal law and some states' laws already protect babies born alive after abortions), unfairly criminalized health care practitioners, and inappropriately interfered in the doctor-patient relationships.:OriginIn the summer of 2020, Snopes readers asked us to look into the accuracy of social media posts that claimed to list the names of 41 U.S. Senators who had ""voted to let babies scream until they die if born alive."":The meme referred to Senate Bill 311 (SB 311), which was introduced in the Senate in January 2019 by Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb. The non-partisan Congressional Research Service summary of the legislation reads as follows: This bill establishes requirements for the degree of care a health care practitioner must exercise in the event a child is born alive following an abortion or attempted abortion.A health care practitioner who is present must (1) exercise the same degree of care as reasonably provided to another child born alive at the same gestational age, and (2) immediately admit the child to a hospital. The bill also requires a health care practitioner or other employee to immediately report any failure to comply with this requirement to law enforcement.A person who violates the requirements is subject to criminal penalties -- a fine, up to five years in prison, or both. Additionally, an individual who intentionally kills or attempts to kill a child born alive is subject to prosecution for murder.The bill bars the criminal prosecution of a mother of a child born alive for conspiracy to violate these provisions, for being an accessory after the fact, or for concealment of felony. A woman who undergoes an abortion or attempted abortion may file a civil action for damages against an individual who violates this bill.:The text of SB 311 can be read in full here. It's true that Democratic and Independent senators did vote to block that bill's progress, but the above-displayed Facebook meme leaves out crucial context -- federal and state laws already provide protections for babies born alive after abortions -- and obscure the stated reasons for those votes, an essential component of any evaluation of a legislative vote. Overall, we rate the meme's core claim as ""Mostly False."" VotesThe proposed ""Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act"" has been stuck in the Senate since February 2019, despite efforts by Republicans to revive it in February 2020. The bill has not been forwarded to any Senate committee, and Republicans have failed on two occasions to obtain the votes necessary to advance the legislation through the Senate. Those two votes, in February 2019 and February 2020, were on motions of cloture. A motion of cloture is, roughly speaking, a proposal signed by at least 16 senators to close debate on a particular bill. At first glance, that might suggest that those in favor of the cloture motion are opposed to the content of the legislation itself, but in fact, ""invoking cloture"" is a way to advance a bill's progress in the Senate by pushing through the debate stage and arriving at a full-Senate vote on the legislation itself. Cloture is a key mechanism for breaking a filibuster in the Senate. :On most matters, a cloture motion must be agreed to by 60% of senators, which usually means 60 votes (except in cases where a Senate seat is temporarily vacant). In the 2019 vote, only 53 members voted ""Yea,"" and in 2020 that number was 56 -- below the 60-vote threshold on each occasion.It's worth noting that the Senate has not yet voted on whether to pass SB 311 itself, so a vote in favor of a motion for cloture should not be conflated with a vote in favor of the substance of the legislation. However, it is reasonable to assume, in general, that senators who voted to push SB 311 through to the next stage towards enactment were also in favor of enacting the bill itself, and those who voted against the cloture motions were doing so in order to halt the legislation's progress because they opposed its contents.This assumption is borne out in the partisan contours of the 2019 and 2020 cloture votes: On both occasions, no Republican voted against the motion, and only Democrats voted against it (including Independent Sens. Angus King of Maine and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who both caucus with the Democrats). On both occasions, three Democrats crossed the floor and voted in favor of the cloture motions: Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, and Doug Jones of Alabama. :The exact claim in the Facebook meme is somewhat confusing. The caption refers to 41 senators, but the list contains 44 names. In February 2019, all 44 of the senators listed in the meme voted against the Republican cloture motion. However, in February 2020, 41 of them voted against the cloture motion, with the remaining three not voting (Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Sanders). So it's not clear to which vote the meme refers. However, on each occasion the wording of the cloture motion and the question put to senators was identical, so the distinction is only a formal one.The Content of SB 311In evaluating whether the Democratic senators listed in the meme did, in fact, ""vote to let babies scream until they die if born alive,"" it is necessary to assess the reasons for their votes against cloture motions and the effect of the failure of the cloture motions. It hardly needs to be said, but neither the bill itself, nor any statements made by the Democratic senators who opposed it, contained any mention of ""babies screaming until they die."" So in voting against the progress of SB 311, no senator was explicitly voting in order to bring about that outcome, in those terms. Rather, that phrase was a characterization of the effect of the votes, which originated from the creator of the Facebook meme. :EffectsBy voting against the cloture motions, the senators halted the progress of a bill that, if enacted, would mean that federal law required health care practitioners to provide the same life-saving treatments and interventions for a baby born alive after a failed abortion (including admitting the baby to a hospital) as they are currently required to provide to babies born alive under other circumstances.The bill would also mean that health care practitioners would be required, under federal law, to report to law enforcement if they became aware that someone else had violated those requirements. Any health practitioner convicted of failing to fulfill those requirements, or failing to report someone else's violation, would be liable to be fined and/or imprisoned for up to five years. SB 311 would also mean that a person found to have intentionally killed a baby born alive after a failed abortion would be liable to conviction and punishment under the federal prohibition against murder. :Does this mean that by preventing the passage of SB 311 Democratic senators were allowing health care practitioners to lawfully let babies die, without rendering aid, if they are born alive after a failed abortion? Not really. Federal law already explicitly states that babies born alive, regardless of the circumstances, are human persons and should be treated as such in the context of criminal law. The Born-Alive Infants Protection Act was signed into law by U.S. President George W. Bush in 2002. It states that:(a) In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States, the words ""person"", ""human being"", ""child"", and ""individual"", shall include every infant member of the species homo sapiens who is born alive at any stage of development.As used in this section, the term ""born alive"", with respect to a member of the species homo sapiens, means the complete expulsion or extraction from his or her mother of that member, at any stage of development, who after such expulsion or extraction breathes or has a beating heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, regardless of whether the umbilical cord has been cut, and regardless of whether the expulsion or extraction occurs as a result of natural or induced labor, cesarean section, or induced abortion.:This means that intentionally killing a baby born alive can be, and is, prosecuted as murder, since the baby is defined under the 2002 act as a human person. In principle, it also means that doctors and nurses have the same professional, legal, and ethical responsibility to babies born alive after failed abortions as they do to babies born alive in other circumstances. The 2002 law does not include an explicit, affirmative duty of care for health care practitioners and does not stipulate any penalties for failing to provide appropriate care. However, many individual states do.Based on research originally published by the anti-abortion Family Research Council, Snopes checked legislation in all 50 states and found that, as of Aug. 20, 2020, 34 states have laws that explicitly either: affirm the equal right to medical care of a baby born alive after an abortion; or assert an affirmative legal obligation for medical practitioners to provide care; or set out criminal penalties for failing to provide care; or all of the above provisions. A full list of each state's ""born alive"" abortion laws, including links to the original legislation, can be found here. :(Note: At the time of the first cloture vote in February 2019, the number of states with ""born alive"" abortion laws was 33. West Virginia's Senate passed the state's own Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act on Feb. 10, 2020, and Gov. Jim Justice signed it into law on March 2, 2020. By the time the U.S. Senate had its second cloture motion on Feb. 25, 2020, Justice had already vowed to sign the West Virginia law, meaning the number of states with ""born alive"" abortion laws was imminently about to become 34.)The effect of the decision to block the progress of SB 311 through the U.S. Senate was to preserve the legal status quo around the country, namely that: two-thirds of states already had laws offering various levels of protection for babies born alive after failed abortions, and various levels of criminal penalties set out for health care practitioners who fail to provide care for them; and that federal law already recognized that babies born alive after failed abortions should be treated as human persons in the context of criminal law. This significantly undermines the Facebook meme's claim that the 44 senators had voted to allow babies to be left to die if they are born alive after a failed abortion, because that it isn't the case in most states.:However, passing SB 311 would mean that there would be no ambiguity about the criminal implications and consequences of the 2002 law. Under SB 311, federal law would unequivocally set out a legal duty of care and a reporting obligation for health care professionals, as well as specific criminal penalties. While the 2002 law empowered states to enact their own ""born alive"" abortion laws, and 34 states have opted to do just that, 16 states have not, and SB 311 would introduce a ""born alive"" abortion law that would apply uniformly throughout the entire country. By voting to block the progress of SB 311, the Democratic and Independent senators did undoubtedly prevent that outcome from becoming much more likely. In evaluating whether voting against the cloture motions on SB 311 meant the 44 senators were voting to allow babies born alive after abortion to simply die without medical aid, it is also necessary to examine the reasons why the senators voted the way they did. Reasons:In general, the Democratic senators who gave statements about their votes on SB 311 said that they had opposed the passage of the bill because they felt it was unnecessary in light of existing law and because they felt it inappropriately criminalized health care practitioners and interfered in the doctor-patient relationship. None said they had voted against the cloture motions in order to allow babies to be left to die or expressed indifference about that outcome.Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, for example, wrote, ""We should not unnecessarily create new federal crimes and penalties to punish behavior that is already illegal under existing state and federal laws."" Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland wrote, ""It has always been illegal to kill or harm a newborn infant, and this bill had nothing to do with that. Instead, this bill would have subjected medical professionals to unprecedented criminal liability and inappropriately comes between a woman and her doctor.""Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii said SB 311 was ""a solution in search of a problem,"" adding, ""Contrary to what the proponents of this bill argue, it is and has always been a crime to harm or kill newborn babies. And people guilty of this crime can already be charged and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."":Speaking from the floor of the Senate, Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois emphasized the fact that abortions that take place late enough for a fetus to show vital signs overwhelmingly occur in the context of a late diagnosis of a fetal abnormality that will, in short order, prove fatal. She stated that her reason for opposing SB 311 was that it would exacerbate the suffering of parents in such scenarios and force health care practitioners to attempt medical interventions that they know to be futile.... Imagine the heartbreak of going to the doctor one day and learning that there's no chance your baby will survive... that there's no hope your baby girl will ever speak her first word or take her first step ... Or that delivering her would put your own life at risk, leaving your firstborn to grow up without a mother. These are the types of scenarios that lead to the heart-wrenching decision to terminate a pregnancy later on. As the mom of two little girls, I can't begin to fathom that kind of pain.And yet today, some on the other side of the aisle are trying to use those parents' suffering for political advantage ... making worst-case scenarios like these all the more difficult by pushing a bill aimed to criminalize reproductive care no matter the cost. If it becomes law, this bill would force doctors to perform ineffective, invasive procedures on fetuses born with fatal abnormalities ... even if it's against the best interests of the child. Even if it goes against recommended standards of care and they know it wouldn't extend or improve the baby's life. Even if it would prolong the suffering of the families ... forcing women to endure added lasting trauma ... making one of the worst moments in their lives somehow even more painful. If physicians refuse, they'd be punished ... sentenced to up to five years in prison.:In February 2019, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American College of Nurse-Midwives co-signed a letter to U.S. Senators, urging them to vote against SB 311 for similar reasons to those given by Duckworth and others, writing:""It [S. 311] injects politicians into the patient-provider relationship, disregarding providers' training and clinical judgment and undermining their ability to determine the best course of action with their patients.""Late-term abortions are exceedingly rare. In 2016, the most recent year for which data was available, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that just 1.2% of abortions took place after 21 weeks' gestational age.Deaths involving babies born alive after an abortion are even rarer. According to CDC data, just 143 newborn deaths were recorded as resulting from spontaneous or induced terminations of pregnancy between 2003 and 2014, a period during which more than 49 million live births took place. The CDC advised that the figure of 143 might be an understatement, but also stated that two-thirds of those newborn deaths involved a ""maternal complication or one or more congenital anomalies,"" which corroborates the claims of Duckworth and others. :"

Marjorie Taylor Greene's account in March 2021 in an attempt to ""silence"" her.Rating:MixtureAbout this rating What's TrueGreene was temporarily suspended by Twitter in March 2021 for roughly half a day.What's FalseHowever, according to Twitter, the suspension was the result of an error in an automated system and not in response to any violation of the platform's terms of service.:On March 19, 2021, some news outlets cited an email sent by the campaign of U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, R-Ga., that stated Greene was suspended by the social media platform Twitter for 12 hours as the result of an attempt to ""silence"" her.""This is yet another attempt by the Silicon Valley Cartel to silence voices that speak out against their far-left woke orthodoxy,"" Greene's office told Politico.Not so, according to Twitter.Twitter said that it did suspend Greene's account temporarily, but by accident, a result of its automated systems erroneously taking enforcement action. Greene's account was reinstated.:Greene is one of the more controversial members of Congress due to her record of voicing of support for various conspiracy theories, such as the pro-Trump conspiracy cult known as QAnon. She was elected to Congress in the November 2020 general election after running unopposed. In February 2021 she was stripped of her committee assignments in Congress over her incendiary rhetoric and support for conspiracy theories.Greene responded to the situation by tweeting that it was the result of a conspiracy against her by Twitter and House Democrats, a claim she offered without evidence::Her tweet was directed at Twitter founder and CEO Jack Dorsey:I was just told @Twitter suspended me for 12 hrs in 'error,' on the same day Dems introduced a resolution to expel me from Congress.What a coincidence?Twitter's little error wasn't resolved until after 12 hrs.@jackwhich employee made the ""error?""Reply to my email, JackGreene was referring to a resolution introduced by U.S. Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif., on the same day of the Twitter kerfuffle. The resolution seeks to expel Greene from the House and accuses Greene of rhetoric supporting violence against her Democratic peers in Congress. Expelling a member of Congress would require support from two-thirds of the House, making the resolution's failure likely, however.:Greene was temporarily suspended by Twitter in January 2021 for violating the platform's terms on election integrity. Greene had promoted false claims of mass-scale voter fraud. Such claims by her and others incited a deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, by supporters of former U.S, President Donald Trump. Trump has been permanently suspended by Twitter for his own role in inciting the riot."

The U.S. ban is slated to take effect April 1, 2024.The decision comes on the heels of repeated public appeals to the Western world by Bill Gates to stop eating real meat and transition to lab-grown synthetic ""beef"" instead.:This item was not a factual recounting of real-life events. The article originated with a website that describes its output as being humorous or satirical in nature, as follows:This is an April Fool's article and the FDA ban on real meat is a fictional scenario. A primary reason why we post April Fool's articles is to act as warnings. We want to wake people up to see what could happen if actions aren't taken to protect and preserve freedom.Mention of the ""Great Reset"" in the article's opening sentence is a reference to a conspiracy theory that posits a cabal of secretive global elites were bent on using the COVID-19 pandemic ""to advance their interests and push forward a globalist plot to destroy American sovereignty and prosperity,"" according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which tracks hate and extremism.As is often the case with conspiracy theories that invoke a ""global elite,"" the conspiracy theory has been used to espouse anti-Semitic ideas, per the ADL.:For background, here is why we sometimes write about satire/humor."
114,114,274.QAnonStillThrivesonF,"As of mid-August 2021, various Facebook accounts, pages, and groups, are still hosting content promoting the cluster of far-right conspiracy theories known as QAnon. This flies in the face of Facebook's Oct. 6, 2020, announcement stating that the company would remove content ""representing QAnon,"" even if those posts or accounts ""contained no violent content.""It's true that various QAnon keywords and hashtags such as ""#WWG1WGA"" (""Where We Go One We Go All"") have been disabled in Facebook's search tool. Instead of seeing search results when looking for these terms, users are shown a link to Facebook's Community Standards. Courtesy: Facebook:However, while no results show up in these searches on Facebook, we found that QAnon content is still hosted by the platform. Users need to do little more than find one post to begin falling down a rabbit hole of deception and lies. Basically, once a single QAnon post is found, it's dangerously simple to follow the trail of likes, comments, and accounts, without the need to do any searching whatsoever.The idea behind QAnon, as The New York Times described it, is about false allegations ""that the world is run by a cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles."" With this falsehood comes a number of hashtags such as #SaveTheChildren and #SaveOurChildren, for example.We easily located a number of Facebook posts that mentioned #SaveOurChildren with #WWG1WGA. In fact, we found multiple posts from a single user over the course of several months that all referenced QAnon. The fact that this screenshot was taken only 23 seconds after the post was made perhaps meant that ""Sass Queen"" controlled both accounts.:Finding this account led us to a QAnon Facebook group named Digital Soldiers United, which had a giant cover image that read: ""Save The Children."" We also found a large number of posts within the public group that carried the hashtag ""#SaveTheChildren."" This group had been around for around one month with nearly 800 posts.In another Facebook group named Trump MAGA Supporters, members shared frog emojis to represent the QAnon mascot, Pepe the Frog. They also mixed vaccine misinformation with QAnon rhetoric and constantly mentioned ""the great awakening,"" which is part of the QAnon conspiracy theory.: The frog emoji was commonly used to represent the QAnon mascot, Pepe the Frog.From these groups and accounts, a Facebook user can follow a rabbit hole into the world of QAnon. Clicking on the accounts of people who liked or commented on the QAnon posts led us to more memes and links.:Further, the sampling of findings in this story perhaps only scratch the surface of the breadth of QAnon content that's hosted by Facebook. According to a DFRLab report from Jared Holt and Max Rizzuto, a lot of the old phrases and keywords that were once associated with QAnon have changed and evolved. The findings were first published on May 26, 2021.Holt and Rizzuto published that a ""neo-QAnon"" now exists, described as ""a cluster of loosely connected conspiracy theory-driven movements that advocate many of the same false claims without the hallmark linguistic stylings that defined QAnon communities during their years of growth.""It's unclear why Facebook and its ""30,000 or 35,000 people"" who are employed to review content are unable to find and take action on QAnon posts and groups like these. Those figures, according to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a July 2021 interview with The Verge, are the number of people who review Facebook content to see if any action needs to be taken.Beyond all of this, we manually reported a handful of these QAnon posts using Facebook's reporting tool, which is available to all users. In 100 percent of the responses that we received from Facebook's support team, the company claimed that the QAnon content ""doesn't go against one of our specific Community Standards."" In reality, all of the posts were very much against Facebook's policies.: A textbook case of QAnon content that Facebook's support team reviewed and said was perfectly acceptable.In our past research, Facebook's reporting tool has long been shown to be extremely ineffective. For example, during our exclusive investigation of ""The BL,"" we manually submitted reports to the company for hundreds of fake accounts. Facebook's support team responses initially claimed that around 95 percent of the accounts were not fake, even though they were. Company employees with higher-ranking job titles finally appeared to step in and remove all of the fake accounts weeks later.:Facebook announced the ban of ""The BL"" weeks after we first filed our first report and notified them by email. It was perhaps the largest foreign disinformation network takedown in Facebook history, involving 55 million followers and $9.5 million in Facebook ads. The news appeared to be mostly lost in the blur of the holiday season, as the ban was announced by Facebook on the Friday afternoon before Christmas in 2019.It's unclear why Facebook and its ""30,000 to 35,000"" content review employees don't take a more proactive approach regarding finding and removing dangerous content, especially considering the gravity of recent national and world news and events. However, until that day comes, we will continue to report our findings to the company.We emailed Facebook about the QAnon rhetoric mentioned in this story. After we reached out, the company appeared to remove much of the policy-breaking content.A Facebook company spokesperson did not respond directly to our questions. Instead, they sent this statement: ""We remove Pages, groups and Instagram accounts that represent QAnon when we identify them and disable the profiles who admin them. We recognize that this is an evolving movement and there are always going to be efforts to circumvent our enforcement. That's why we work to identify new terms and partner with external experts to study its evolution so we can keep more of this content off of our platform."":"
115,115,682.WasanFBIAgentWhoExpo,"Claim:An FBI agent who exposed Hillary Clinton's corruption was found murdered.Rating:FalseAbout this rating OriginOn 18 June 2018, the disreputable Neon Nettle website  published an article reporting that an FBI agent was murdered as part of a conspiracy to cover up the corruption of Hillary Clinton, who unsuccessfully ran for the presidency of the U.S. in 2016::An FBI Special Agent, who was anticipated to expose the extent of Clinton and Obama malpractice and corruption in the ""Operation Fast and Furious"" cover-up before a US Federal Grand Jury, has been found dead at his home.The FBI official's wife was also found dead at the scene with the couple both being murdered using the 52-year-old agent's own gun.Special Agent David Raynor was ""stabbed multiple times"" and ""shot twice with his own weapon,"" according to local media reports. Raynor's tragic death comes just one day before he was due to testify before a US Federal Grand Jury.He was widely expected to testify that Hillary Clinton acted illegally to protect Obama administration crimes while covering up the Fast and Furious scandal.But there's no mystery surrounding how Raynor died -- Anne Arundel County Police Lt. Ryan Frashure told us officers witnessed Raynor's turning his gun on himself on 7 March 2018: There is nothing in the investigation that turned up evidence indicating it's anything other than a domestic-related suicide. When our officers confronted [Raynor], he committed suicide in front of our officers. He was given verbal commands to drop the weapon, and when [officers] were approaching him, that's when he put the gun to his head.:Investigators believe Raynor stabbed his 54-year-old wife, Donna Fisher, to death near their home in Crownsville, Maryland, before killing himself. The couple had been in the midst of divorce proceedings and, Frashure said, were  ""having serious domestic issues."" The week they died they were in court fighting over custody of their 10-year-old daughter.According to investigators, no evidence suggests Raynor's death was in any way connected to the Fast and Furious operation, an Obama-era ""gunwalking"" scandal.  Moreover, ""Fast and Furious"" had nothing to do with Hillary Clinton's State Department, as it involved the Phoenix division of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' (ATF), an organization within the United States Department of Justice (DOJ).Neon Nettle's sole documentation for their claim that Raynor died ""just one day before he was due to testify before a US Federal Grand Jury"" was a link to an eight-month-old news article about the shooting death of a Baltimore homicide detective, an article that made no mention of David Raynor, the FBI, Hillary Clinton, or ""Fast and Furious."" (The slain detective was scheduled to testify before a federal grand jury, but that case was about Baltimore police accused of shaking down citizens and conspiring with drug dealers, not about the ATF and gunwalking in Arizona.):As is often the case with stories published by Neon Nettle, the only other sources reporting that Raynor was murdered in a conspiracy to cover up Clinton's corruption were similar disreputable web sites."
116,116,607.DidtheFBIWipethePhon,"Claim:The FBI ""wiped"" phones belonging to eyewitnesses of the Las Vegas massacre.Rating:UnprovenAbout this rating On 12 October 2017, conspiracy trolling network InfoWars and its YouTube-ranting editor-at-large Paul Joseph Watson reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had ""wiped"" the phones of eye witnesses to the 1 October Las Vegas mass shooting before returning them to their owners.:For proof of what one would imagine to be an explosive claim, Watson cited only Facebook posts he had seen:According to a Las Vegas resident who posted a status update on Facebook, ""A bunch of people that worked the Route 91 said they got their cell phones back today. They all said that all their phones are completely wiped clean! All messages and info from that weekend are completely gone. Anyone else experience this?""""A few different people who were vendors there are all saying the same thing,"" the woman later comments.InfoWars has been busily stitching together a cover-up narrative that the FBI and local law enforcement are actively seizing evidence of a second gunman in a far-reaching conspiracy to hide yet another ""false flag"" operation (a false flag is conspiracy jargon for a catastrophe engineered by the government; the ""false flag"" is often presented as a precursor to taking Americans' guns away, something that has demonstrably not happened over the decades of mass shootings in the United States). David Knight, host of a show on InfoWars called ""The Real News"" put it this way in a segment about Las Vegas::[It] is time for us to remind each other of the long history of our government's setting up false flag attacks. They don't care if people die if it forwards their agenda for legislation or for government control or for surveillance. When people die it only makes it more powerful for them when that happens.We reached out to the FBI and got no response; however, generally speaking, the Bureau does not comment on ongoing investigations. On 10 October 2017, the FBI began returning personal items to the crowd of 22,000 concert goers who had abruptly fled the hail of gunfire ten days earlier -- everything from cell phones, to purses, wallets, jewelry, and clothing. The shooter's electronic belongings were taken to the FBI's laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, according to news reports. Whether any of the returned cell phones were damaged or had missing data is unclear. InfoWars blurred out the names of two people who allegedly posted about it, making it impossible to reach out to them.But the FBI didn't ""wipe"" witnesses' phones to hide evidence of a second shooter. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD), which is leading the investigation, found no evidence anyone other than Stephen Paddock, 64, of Mesquite, Nevada, shot at the Route 91 Harvest Festival crowd that night before turning the gun on himself. :The report cobbled together by Watson -- based on no evidence other than the hearsay of a Facebook conversation -- was picked up by a swarm of disreputable web sites eager to prove their pet conspiracy theories, including quack health site Natural News and the rabidly anti-Muslim MadWorld News and Geller Report. It was also shared far and wide by individual Facebook users and pages like The Daily Sheeple, which has more than 60,000 fans.Since the deadliest mass shooting in recent American history, in which 58 were killed and hundreds injured, conspiracy theorists have, as usual, cherry-picked bits of information that fit their own narratives. Many have latched on to the fact that during the course of the investigation, details like the timeline of events and Paddock's check-in date at the Mandalay Bay hotel, from which he fired on the crowd, have changed -- although Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo and other high-ranking law enforcement officials have already said that should be expected due to large number of people and agencies involved in the incident, from which information had to be collected and organized.As a case in point, apparently dissatisfied with the anticlimactic fact that no motive has yet been ascertained and that Paddock has no currently known ties to foreign terrorist organizations, conservative media personality Ann Coulter wrote for Breitbart.com::I don't know what happened -- and, apparently, neither do the cops -- but it's kind of odd that we keep being told things that aren't true about the Las Vegas massacre, from the basic timeline to this weird insistence that Paddock made a good living at gambling.The most likely explanation is that the reporters and investigators are incompetent nitwits. But the changing facts from law enforcement and preposterous lies from the press aren't doing a lot to tamp down alternative theories of the crime.[...]If this were a movie script, a terrorist would go to Paddock's room on the pretense of buying guns, kill Paddock, commit the massacre, put his gunshot residue-covered gloves on Paddock's dead hands and slip out of the room when the coast was clear.In a previous interview about the conspiracy theories surrounding the investigation, LVMPD officer Larry Hadfield told us that no matter what they say about the facts gathered in the course of the official investigation, police can't convince those who are determined to believe their own preferred narrative::We tell people what we know. If they don't believe it but they're going to believe whatever web site, then I don't know what else to tell you."
117,117,643.UKRAINENewCrisisGrim,"It is a grim measure of the frequency of crisis events in recent years, and the ubiquity of online disinformation, that when a major story breaks -- a terrorist attack, a mass shooting, or an act of war -- the writers and editors at Snopes can typically predict what comes next. Recycled videos and photographs, stripped from their proper context, and the same old tropes, all designed to inflame or confuse, or even amuse, the reader.Each fresh crisis brings its own new styles and variants of misinformation, of course, which require careful and patient analysis. However, we can quickly recognize much of what appears online for what it is -- unoriginal and inauthentic. So it was during the week of Feb. 21, when Russian troops began their invasion of Ukraine.The following is a rough overview of the familiar disinformation trends and recurring memes that the Snopes team recognized and addressed, in the opening days of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Images: Rehashed, Recycled, and Repurposed:Misleading, decontextualized, and even fabricated photographs and video footage have long been a feature of conflicts and crises. Our collective experience and institutional memory of such major events means we're immediately on the lookout for similar inauthentic content, with every new crisis.For example, back in February 2019, a video emerged online that appeared to show an Indian air strike against Islamic militants in Pakistan. However, upon further inspection, Snopes was able to determine that the footage actually came from a military simulation video game called ARMA 2. Similarly, when a U.S. drone strike killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Iraq in January 2020, we addressed rumors about a viral clip that was presented as showing the attack on Soleimani, but in fact originated with another video game.  :So, in February 2022, when widely shared social media posts appeared to show Ukrainian forces firing missiles at Russian artillery, in the context of the invasion, it grabbed our attention and prompted some digging. As it turned out, the video clip originated in yet another video game, this time ARMA 3 -- the sequel of the game that gave rise to the fake Pakistani footage three years earlier. A different crisis on a different continent, but the same misinformation techniques.On Feb. 25, we encountered a case of ""art imitating life"" when social media users enthusiastically shared a clip that appeared to show the ""Ghost of Kyiv"" -- purportedly a Ukrainian fighter pilot responsible for shooting down six Russian military aircraft during the conflict. In reality, the fake footage came from Digital Combat Simulator, though its creator said it had been intended as a tribute to the legendary fighter pilot, whose exploits have not yet been confirmed as fact.Troll Tropes: Sam Hyde and 'Bernie Gores':Sam Hyde is an American comedian whose face and name, or variations of it, have been linked with mass shootings, terrorist attacks, and other major news events, for several years, as part of a protracted and now grimly predictable collective acts of trolling. Those acts are popular among the alt-right and far-right pseudo-satirical, ""post-ironic"" internet users who frequent online forums such as 4chan.In November 2017, for example, such individuals -- typically young men -- delighted in promoting apparently earnest posts that named ""Samir al-Hajid"" (a crudely modified version of Hyde's name) as the suspected shooter in a mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas.Trolls have also named Hyde as a suspect in several other mass shootings such as those in: Kalamazoo, Michigan; Las Vegas, Nevada; Orlando, Florida; and San Bernardino, California. In 2017, U.S. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-Texas, inadvertently named Hyde as a suspect in the Sutherland Springs shooting, during a live interview with CNN.:So in February 2022, when social media users shared what looked like a Ukrainian passport described as belonging to a ""fallen Azov leader,"" we immediately recognized the photograph as Hyde's::The fake passport appears to have originated on 4chan and Twitter, sometimes along with clues as to its pseudo-satirical origins, but screenshots of it were subsequently disseminated on Facebook, without such context.Hyde's face also featured in bogus social media posts that actually originated in authentic news reports published by the Irish Times and the Times of London. In one particularly egregious example, trolls digitally edited an authentic photograph of a real Ukrainian soldier, 29-year-old Andrey Valerievich, who died near Kramatorsk in Donetsk in May 2020, according to a Facebook tribute posted by the mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi::Hoaxers superimposed Hyde's face on to Valerievich's, edited the flag patch to show the Russian flag instead of the Ukrainian, and posted the resulting image online with the caption ""Russian airborne troops have reported [their] first casualty""::In a similar vein, trolls promoted another recurring hoax involving ""Bernie Gores"" -- a fictional character whose name is a play on words which, when pronounced in a certain way, forces the speaker to utter an exceptionally offensive racist phrase. While ""Gores"" does not exist, the man in the photograph typically associated with him does. He is a YouTube personality and gamer named Jodie Johnston, who is also known as ""Wings of Redemption.""Since August 2020, trolls associated with the gamer and alt-right subcultures have used photographs of Johnston, along with the fictional ""Gores"" name, typically describing him as the victim of various disasters and acts of violence including: the August 2020 Beirut explosion; the Taliban takeover of Kabul in August 2021; and a devastating tornado in Kentucky, in December 2021.So when the name and face appeared again in February 2022 -- this time ""Bernie Goranov"" as a ""journalist"" killed in Ukraine -- we understood the background and could place it in the broader context of crisis-related alt-right trolling::Crisis/Opportunity for Conspiracy TheoristsBecause Snopes has been writing about disinformation for so long, we know that another common feature of global events is that conspiracy theorists and bad actors frequently take advantage of the uncertainty, confusion, and fear that surrounds major crises, in order to advance and spread their theory of choice.In 2020, for example, conspiracy theorists used the COVID-19 pandemic to fuel and promote pre-existing, fear-mongering about the ""New World Order,"" mass surveillance, vaccination, and involuntarily implanted microchips and tracking devices. Similarly, conspiracy theorists repeatedly seize upon mass shootings to promote their baseless claims about gun control and authoritarianism.Similarly, in February 2022, conspiracy theorists seized upon Russia's air bombing of military targets in Ukraine to advance an old, baseless piece of Russian propaganda -- given new life by COVID-era conspiracy theorists -- that the United States has been developing a top-secret network of laboratories for producing biological weapons including coronavirus itself and, most insidiously of all, that Russia's invasion of Ukraine was in fact a heroic campaign to disarm those biolabs.: "
118,118,55.IWasSethRichforaDayD,"Jeff Gero, 36, has lived and worked in the nation's capitol for 10 years, but the closest he ever came to involvement in national politics was when he was mistaken for a deceased Democratic Party campaign worker -- and not just any deceased Democratic Party campaign worker.As Gero quizzically informed his friends in a 7 August 2017 post on his Facebook page, a ""conspiracy theory ding dong"" had tagged him in a Twitter photo as Seth Rich, the 27-year-old Democratic National Committee (DNC) data analyst who was murdered two weeks before the 2016 Democratic convention::Gero, who owns and manages a bar called Looking Glass in Washington, D.C. (but never, to his knowledge, met or bumped into Seth Rich), says he was at a tennis match when a friend showed him a text message containing the post. ""We had to leave for fear of disrupting the match because we were laughing so hard,"" he told us via e-mail.That is Gero in the photo, on the left, he confirmed. The photo was indeed taken at the Wonderland Ballroom (another D.C. watering hole), during a spring fundraising event called the ""Sundress Fest"" -- which explains the frilly attire, in case you were wondering.""I don't often wear dresses but I think I pull it off pretty well,"" Gero joked. ""It's an awesome party.""We have not been able to piece together the precise chain of events leading up to the tweet identifying the sundress-clad Jeff Gero as Seth Rich, but we do know who issued the tweet, and, in general terms, why. Self-styled ""conservative truth-slinger"" Matt Couch tweeted the photo on 2 August 2017, as part of his ongoing effort to prove that Rich was ""assassinated"" for leaking a trove of internal DNC e-mails to WikiLeaks.:As of this writing, Rich's murder remains unsolved. The Metropolitan Police Department says that he was shot twice in the back while walking home from a bar In the early morning hours of 10 July 2016, in what appears to have been a botched robbery attempt. Despite the MPD's insistence that no evidence has emerged indicating that the homicide was related to Rich's work at the DNC, conspiracy theorists on both the right and the left have relentlessly pushed the alternative narrative that it was Rich, not Russian hackers, who leaked the tens of thousands of DNC e-mails that showed up on the WikiLeaks web site less than a week after his death, and that was the ""real"" reason he was killed.Matt Couch is one of the many ""investigators"" still promulgating these unsubstantiated claims, despite pleas from Rich's family that they stop. ""The continual push of false and inaccurate information about Seth's death, along with the harassment of Seth's friends, family and co-workers, hurts those who were closest to Seth, and does nothing to bring justice to his killers,"" his parents and brother said in a joint statement released on the one-year anniversary -- 10 July 2017 -- of Rich's death. ""Those who still live in Seth's neighborhood are owed the peace of mind that comes with finding those responsible for this heinous crime, and we deserve that no less."":In some cases it fell on deaf ears, unfortunately:Why will no one close to Seth Rich. Work towards solving his murder??? #SethRich-- Matt Couch (@RealMattCouch) July 19, 2017The Roommates lied... The Girlfriend Lied... The Police are Lying... Why is everyone Lying in the Seth Rich Murder? #SethRich #CoverUp-- Matt Couch (@RealMattCouch) August 5, 2017We strongly believe that Seth Rich was lured out of Lou's City Bar or The Wonderland Ballroom by someone he knew. #HisNameWasSethRich-- Matt Couch (@RealMattCouch) July 27, 2017Couch's preoccupation with the Wonderland Ballroom stems, we assume, from unconfirmed reports that Rich either went there, or told someone he was going there, the night he was killed. Someone -- whether it was Couch himself or a fellow ""investigator,"" we do not know -- discovered the uncaptioned photograph of Gero on the Wonderland Ballroom's web site and leaped to the conclusion that it was of Seth Rich, resulting in the tweet (since deleted, for obvious reasons) that would make Jeff Gero's day.:Of the unknown number of Couch's 43,000 or so followers who retweeted the photo, one, at least, called him on his misidentification of the subject, tweeting this visual aid for comparison:Close, but no cigar...hairline is biggest indicator. pic.twitter.com/FU4HFQzUJM-- ClevelandITGuy (@ClevelandITGuy) August 7, 2017This presumably figured in Couch's decision to scrub the erroneous tweet. In any case, he never went on to correctly identify Gero as the subject of the photo, much less contact him to discuss it. ""You would think, claiming to be the ""truth slinger"" he is,"" Gero says, ""he would have retracted it and publicly apologized."" The good news is that outing himself as the real subject of the photo did not lead to Gero's being hounded or harassed by any of the folks he refers to as ""crazies."" He and his friends ""had a good laugh"" upon sharing Couch's tweet, Gero says, but he has little patience for the Seth Rich conspiracy theory itself, nor does anyone else in the circles in which he travels.:""Most people I know are rational people,"" says Gero. ""My thoughts are with Seth Rich's family. I feel bad that they have to deal with people perpetuating this garbage.""Our attempts to contact Matt Couch for comment were unsuccessful."

120,120,141.DidTrumpDirecttheUSE,"Claim:The Trump administration gave a directive to the U.S. embassy in South Africa not to assist former President Obama during his trip there.On 18 July 2018, South African newspaper The Citizen reported that the Trump administration had directed the American embassy in Pretoria, South Africa, not to provide any assistance, other than security, to former President Barack Obama during the latter's visit there celebrating the 100th birthday anniversary of late anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela. Citing a highly-placed source, The Citizen reported: 'Instructions by Washington' were that no assistance other than security be given to the former US president - a break from diplomatic tradition.The Mandela 100 commemoration became a mini battlefield in the ongoing US political war this week, as the Trump administration ordered that Barack Obama not be given any assistance other than security arrangements by the American embassy in South Africa.The high-profile visit by the former president was mainly arranged and coordinated by the Nelson Mandela and Obama foundations, with no assistance from the US embassy in Pretoria - a break from the diplomatic tradition of offering support to any visiting American leader.None of the US embassy staff had to play any role due to ""instructions by Washington"" that Obama should not be provided any assistance, according to a highly placed source.In the past, the US embassy has always provided full support to any visiting American leader regardless of party affiliation.:Charles Cilliers, digital editor for The Citizen, followed up with us two weeks after the article was originally published and said the newspaper stands by its report, noting their source is a ""well-placed member of staff at the embassy itself.""Cilliers also pointed out that the U.S. embassy in Pretoria effectively corroborated The Citizen's report by confirming it helped only with security during Obama's visit. The embassy also did not deny receiving a directive from the White House instructing staff not to provide any further assistance beyond that in a statement to The Citizen quoted in a follow-up story dated 21 July 2018:Embassy spokesperson Cynthia Harvey confirmed to The Citizen on Saturday that Obama had only been assisted with security arrangements: ""Former president Barack Obama's visit to South Africa was a private visit by a former president. He was in South Africa as a private citizen. The US Embassy in Pretoria supported US agencies providing security for the former president.""We are certainly honoured that the Nelson Mandela Foundation chose an American to be the speaker at their annual Mandela Lecture this year. The respect and admiration Obama had for Nelson Mandela is shared by many American leaders and citizens.""The high-profile visit by the former president was mainly arranged and coordinated by the Nelson Mandela and Obama foundations. The scant assistance from the US Embassy in Pretoria was seen by some as a break from the diplomatic tradition of offering support to any visiting American leader.:We reached out to the U.S. State Department and asked directly whether any instructions were given by the Trump administration regarding assistance from the embassy for Obama's visit, and whether former Obama or his foundation requested any assistance other than security. We receive the following response from a State Department spokesperson:Former President Barack Obama's visit to South Africa was a private visit by a former president. He was in South Africa as a private citizen. Any questions regarding his visit should be directed to the Obama Foundation or its representatives. The U.S. Embassy in Pretoria supported U.S. agencies providing security for the former President.We also reached out to the Obama Foundation and the White House but received no answers to similar questions by press time. It's no secret the relationship between U.S. President Donald Trump and Barack Obama is a contentious one. During his visit to South Africa, Obama gave a widely-viewed speech in Johannesburg honoring Mandela in which he took a swipe at what some interpreted as Trump's proclivity to stretch the truth, decrying the ""utter loss of shame among political leaders where they're caught in a lie and they just double down and they lie some more."":For his part, Donald Trump long promoted the ""birther"" conspiracy theory that falsely claims Barack Obama was born in Kenya and therefore was ineligible to serve as President of the United States. We will update this story pending further information."

Rating:FalseAbout this rating In November 2021, health officials announced that they had discovered a new variant of COVID-19 and that they were calling the new strain ""omicron."" Shortly thereafter, internet users pointed out that ""omicron"" is an anagram for ""moronic."" While this linguistic oddity proved humorous to some, others attempted to use this interesting, albeit completely irrelevant, factoid to sow doubt about the vaccines, falsely claiming that the pandemic was a hoax and that scientists were flaunting their control over society by naming these variants with disguised insults. (In reality, this variant was named after a letter in the Greek alphabet.):As this conspiracy theory gained traction, a similar rumor started to circulate on social media claiming that ""ecneics,"" science spelled backwards, was a pagan term for a device that was used to summon ""Satin"" (an apparent misspelling of ""Satan"").:""Ecneics"" is not a pagan word for a ""Satin""-summoning device that was used to ""brianwash"" children and turn them into ""syantasts.""We couldn't find this word in any English-language dictionaries. We also searched a number of pagan and Wiccan books -- such as ""The Dictionary of Wicca, Witchcraft and Magick,"" ""A Popular Dictionary of Paganism,"" ""The Wiccan's Dictionary of Prophecy and Omens,"" and ""A Dictionary of Pagan Religions"" -- but found no mentions of this word.The above-displayed tweet has been floating around since at least 2019. It's often shared in jest by those mocking people who have endorsed pseudoscience (such as those putting weight on the fact that omicron is an anagram of moronic). It was first posted by the now-defunct Twitter account @Warriorofwoke, an account that frequently posted messages about ""chemtrail"" and ""flat earth"" conspiracy theories. While we're not sure of the original poster's intent, the multiple misspellings in this tweet, the outrageousness of the claim, and the fact that it was posted by an account that often posted outlandish takes on conspiracy theories, leads us to believe that this message was first posted as a joke. In any case, ""ecneics"" is not a pagan word. :Even so, it has been used on occasion over the decades. In 1974, the ""New Scientists"" published an article about ""The Philosopher of Ecneics,"" a Japanese doctor who believed it was important to be critical of the influence science had on society. More recently, Chicago Tribune columnist Rex Huppke used the word in a 2015 article, writing:I'm not exactly sure what ""science"" means. I could look it up in a dictionary, but I don't believe in dictionaries. I've heard they cause brainwashing and are in the pocket of Big Lexicography.[...]It's thanks to that kind of logic that America faces the return of the once-eradicated measles virus. A small, vocal and highly insufferable portion of the population has taken it upon themselves to doubt the irrefutable scientific evidence that childhood vaccinations are safe and effective. And so they don't vaccinate their kids.[...]The problem is, we've got too many people who believe in ""ecneics"" (pronounced eck-nakes), which is ""science"" spelled backward. While scientists study the physical and natural word and reach consensus based on experimentation and observation, ecneictists (eck-nake-tists) look at a scientific consensus and then decide the opposite is true because that's what they want to believe.:"

In this case, there were plenty of anti-Semitic, anti-Zionist, and anti-Israeli groups eager to use the horrors of September 11 as fodder for propaganda to serve their own political ends.:The pieces quoted above scarcely merit the dignity of a rebuttal. One need only have read newspaper accounts of the thousands of deaths, viewed TV news interviews with grieving families, and scanned the lists of the dead and missing to know that the terrorist attack on New York City claimed the lives of Christians, Jews, and Muslims; agnostics, atheists, and the non-religious alike. No religion was spared, no denomination singled out. Ordinary people of all nationalities suffered. No miracles, human intervention, foreknowledge, coincidence, or vagaries of fate saved more than a few World Trade Center workers from meeting their deaths that day.Nonetheless, those with something to gain by sowing the seeds of divisiveness would have had us believe that Israel had advance warning of the World Trade Center attack and managed to notify 4,000 Israeli nationals who worked in the two towers about the upcoming horror, but that they left the U.S. completely unaware of the danger.(""Hello, David Rosenberg? This is the Mossad. Listen, don't go to work on Tuesday. Yeah, another terrorist attack on the U.S. ... call in sick. And remember, not a word to any of your gentile relatives, friends, or co-workers.""):And even though this scoop to top all scoops winged its way all over the Internet, the American press apparently remained completely in the dark about the nefarious scheme. Is it any surprise that this story emanated from sources such as Pravda and Al-Manar, the pro-Palestinian ""Channel of Arabs and Muslims""?Why would Israel follow such a course of action, betray its staunchest ally, and doom thousands of innocent Americans to death? There were no rational answers to that question, only ugly propagandistic ones. ""Israel wanted to draw America into a final showdown with its Arab enemies, so they didn't warn us"" -- the same type of conspiracy theory that posited our leaders knew about the impending Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor allowed it to happen in order to galvanize public support for a war. Old theory, new clothes. Even darker was the implication that Israel, not content to wait for an attack which would embroil America in a Middle Eastern war, forced the issue by pulling off a monstrous act of terrorism again the USA themselves.""It is clear to all that the Jews/Israel have most to gain and should be considered as a possible source behind this act,"" we were told. Those who authored and disseminated this kind of rubbish were really the ones with the most to gain.:News accounts in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks demonstrated that Jews and Israelis did die in the World Trade Towers that day. A 18 September 2001 CNN article reported on one Manhattan synagogue that had lost six of its members in the attacks, five in the towers and one at the Pentagon. A 21 September 2001 ABC News article showed that at (then) last count 400 Jews were killed in the attack. And a 21 September 2001 New York Times article detailed efforts then underway to identify the Jews whose bodies remained beneath the World Trade Center rubble.The rumor apparently originated with a relatively innocuous Israeli news report speculating that about 4,000 Israelis were believed to have been in the areas of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon at the time of the 9/11 attacks, and that tidbit quickly morphed into the idea that 4,000 Israelis -- all of them employees of companies housed in one or the other of the WTC towers -- had all suspiciously failed to show up for work on 9/11:Vague conspiracy theories blaming Israel began to appear within 24 hours of the attacks. Syria's government-owned Al Thawra newspaper may have been the first newspaper to make the ""4,000 Jews"" claim. According to U.S. embassy reporting, its September 15th edition falsely claimed ""four thousand Jews were absent from their work on the day of the explosions.""The 4,000 figure apparently came from an article entitled ""Hundreds of Israelis missing in WTC attack"" which appeared in the September 12th internet edition of the Jerusalem Post. It stated, ""The Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem has so far received the names of 4,000 Israelis believed to have been in the areas of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon at the time of the attacks.""Unknown conspiracy theorists apparently seized upon the 4,000 figure, transforming it into the false claim that 4,000 Jews did not report for work at the World Trade Center on September 11.:But later analysis showed that the proportion of Jews among occupants of the World Trade Center who were killed in the 9/11 attacks was the same as their proportion of the general New York area population:A total of 2,071 occupants of the World Trade Center died on September 11, among the 2,749 victims of the WTC attacks. According to an article in the October 11, 2001, Wall Street Journal, roughly 1,700 people had listed the religion of a person missing in the WTC attacks; approximately 10% were Jewish. A later article, in the September 5, 2002, Jewish Week, stated, ""based on the list of names, biographical information compiled by The New York Times, and information from records at the Medical Examiner's Office, there were at least 400 victims either confirmed or strongly believed to be Jewish."" This would be approximately 15% of the total victims of the WTC attacks. A partial list of 390 Cantor Fitzgerald employees who died (out of 658 in the company) lists 49 Jewish memorial services, which is between 12% and 13%.This 10-15% estimate of Jewish fatalities tracks closely with the percentage of Jews living in the New York area. According to the 2002 American Jewish Year Book, 9% of the population of New York State, where 64% of the WTC victims lived, is Jewish. A 2002 study estimated that New York City's population was 12% Jewish. Forty-three percent of the WTC victims lived in New York City. Thus, the number of Jewish victims correlates very closely with the number of Jewish residents in New York. If 4,000 Jews had not reported for work on September 11, the number of Jewish victims would have been much lower than 10-15%.:Additional Information::      The 4,000 Jews Rumor  (U.S. Department of State)"

No news stories published within a week of the meme's posting indicated that 24 children had been sent home from the hospital cancer-free. We contacted St. Jude about the claim and received following statement in response:""While we appreciate the promotion of the work we do at St. Jude to treat pediatric cancer and other life-threatening diseases, the idea of a cure is complicated. More than 80 percent of children with cancer become long-term survivors, meaning they survive five years past their cancer diagnosis. Each year, St. Jude treats more than 7,000 children with cancer.""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital is named after St. Jude Thaddeus, the patron saint of hope and impossible causes. It specializes in pediatric cancer and is renowned for treating patients free of cost thanks to donor support. According to the hospital's literature, its medical staff treats 7,500 patients annually, and St. Jude has 78 beds for children requiring in-patient treatment. We found no St. Jude press release boasting about 24 children all being released cancer-free in one week, a news event that the hospital, which is funded by charitable donations, almost certainly would have made public.:It's unclear what message the meme maker was trying to send. However the false notion that a cure for cancer exists but is being suppressed by the pharmaceutical industry is a popular and persistent conspiracy theory."

The Daily Dot reports that the creator of the site prefers to put it another way:Awake Dating is a site focused on pairing up people who identify as ""awake,"" which Jarrod Fidden, the COO of Awake Dating, defines as ""one who has investigated and come to his or her own conclusions on a collection of topics and issues.

The new site aims to connect the ""awake"" with one another, and match them up based on their set of beliefs -- in some ways, no different from dating by religious preferences (except instead of discussing God, you may be talking about Illuminati lizard people).:The YouTube ad for the site pokes fun at the way outsiders portray the ""awake"" with humorous photographs and a catchy tune about anti-vaxxers and false flags::It's possible that this page is an extended troll, but even if it is, there are other dating sites that cater to the conspiracy theory set."

Here's one example of from the social media site Imgur: (Screenshot, Imgur):We'll look at the origin of both the John Titor conspiracy theory below.Who Is John Titor?It all started on Nov. 2, 2000, when an internet user with the handle Timetravel_0 began posting on a forum, claiming he came from the future and had just stopped by at the turn of the century while on task to retrieve an IBM 5100 computer system from 1975.""My 'time' machine is a stationary mass, temporal displacement unit manufactured by General Electric. The unit is powered by two top-spin dual-positive singularities that produce a standard off-set Tipler sinusoid,"" he wrote.The user later began posting on forums using the name ""John Titor,"" generating a lot of curiosity and interest. The story was covered extensively by the popular supernatural- and conspiracy-themed radio show ""Coast to Coast,"" hosted by Art Bell.:On March 21, 2001, Titor stated he was returning to 2036 and stopped posting messages. He hasn't been heard from since. No one has ever taken credit for creating John Titor, nor has anyone been definitely proven to have posted as the time traveler. Sleuths have since attempted to trace the messages, with an Italian investigative TV show called ""Voyager"" pointing to a eponymously-named John Titor Foundation, which published a book presenting the Titor story as real, and an entertainment lawyer named Lawrence Haber, who some theorize was the mastermind of the John Titor phenomenon from the start.Where Did the Photo Come From?As we previously reported, the photograph above, in which the alleged time traveler allegedly appears, doesn't show any such thing. Though the man in the photograph may appear to some modern viewers to be dressed in anachronistic attire and out of place in 1941, all of the articles of clothing he's wearing in the picture, from the sunglasses to the Montreal Maroons shirt, were readily available at that time.:The photograph was taken in Canada at the reopening of the South Fork Bridge and was part of the Barlorne-Pioneer Museum's exhibit called ""The Past Lives Here,"" which started in 2004. Perhaps predictably, fantastical theories about the picture's contents took off after the museum digitized it and placed it in its online collection."

Lee Grady with the hopeful headline, ""North Korea Will Open Its Doors to Christianity."" The article was written amid news of historic thawing of relations between North and South Korea and talk of the North dismantling its nuclear program.:One day later, the notoriously disreputable blog YourNewsWire.com reappropriated the piece, for the most part republishing it word-for-word -- but attaching their own writer's name to it. YourNewsWire also rewrote the headline to misleadingly report that North Korea's acceptance of Christianity was a done deal: ""North Korea Agrees To Open Its Doors To Christianity.""But because the original story doesn't claim that North Korea is already welcoming the free practice of Christianity, the article doesn't support YourNewsWire's headline. Instead, it expresses religious views about ongoing developments on the Korean peninsula and hopes that Christians will make inroads soon:When I heard the news last week about the Korean miracle--after I pinched myself to see it was a dream--I turned to Psalm 46. It says: ""Come, see the works of the Lord ... He makes wars cease to the end of the earth; He breaks the bow and cuts off the spear; He burns the chariot in the fire"" (vv. 8-9).God has worked this miracle. It is not the work of any politician. He has heard the prayers of his people on both sides of this conflict--and the prayers of the faithful around the world who felt North Korea's pain. He will engineer a lasting peace in this part of the world, and open the doors wide for the gospel to flourish in a thirsty land.Before long, the churches of South Korea will freely send teams into the North with food, medicine and the message of Christ. Like a patient who has been in a coma, North Korea will awaken. The world will watch a national transformation. We are witnessing the greatest display of God's sovereign power over nations since the Berlin Wall fell.:Although the repressive state of North Korea may well some day welcome religion, it is currently de facto prohibited. Ji-Min Kang, a columnist for NK News who lived in Pyongyang until 2005, explained the dynamic in a 2014 column:North Korea's ruling principles are based on Juche ideology, which is itself based on Marxist materialism. Karl Marx was a sharp critic of organised religion, saying it was ""the opium of the people"". In essence then, the basic principles of North Korean socialism are strongly opposed to and incompatible with religious beliefs.Even though the North Korean constitution officially states that it allows the freedom of religion, this freedom simply does not exist in the North. As such, I had to learn continuously about the negative effects and harms of a religion while growing up in North Korea. This environment therefore makes many North Koreans agnostic, but some of course conduct religious activities behind closed doors, often however with serious consequences.YourNewsWire frequently generates clicks by latching on to the news cycle and adding their own outlandish, conspiratorial, or outright false narratives to actual news stories. For example, the site in 2017 lumped the suicide deaths of rock singers Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington in with the notorious (and utterly ridiculous) Pizzagate conspiracy theory, falsely reporting they were murdered because they were about to expose a ring of ""entertainment industry pedophiles."":"

Generally speaking, these posts made inflammatory and violent claims, then falsely attributed them to BLM.:For example, one such hoax held that BLM protesters were going to ""assassinate white families."" In June 2020, Snopes came across yet another flyer falsely attributed to Black Lives Matter that labeled white men, women, and children as ""the enemy""::But this is not a genuine flyer issued or endorsed by Black Lives Matter. This is a piece of racist propaganda that was created in an apparent attempt to smear BLM and heighten racial tensions. It isn't clear who created this fake poster. The earliest posting that we could find was from June 11, 2020, from a Twitter account devoted to QAnon, a wide-ranging and far-right conspiracy theory based almost entirely on anonymous social media posts that claim a ""deep state"" plot exists against President Donald Trump. From there, it was shared to the Russian site Aftershock.news; an All Lives Matter account; and an account adorned with British flags, where it received thousands of retweets.While we've found several accounts sharing this flyer along with messages denigrating Black Lives Matter, we've yet to see any accounts connected to the Black Lives Matter movement sharing this flyer in earnest. In addition to the fact that this flyer originated with posters critical of BLM -- and not with BLM accounts spreading this message in earnest -- the statements on this flyer are also contrary to the positions of the Black Lives Matter movement. Nowhere on the Black Lives Matter website are white people identified as ""enemies,"" and the website is void of any calls to violence against white people. :BLM has also not called for ""re-education camps,"" for ""Black power"" to run the government, or for white people to stop dating outside their race. The official Black Lives Matter website has put out a list of ""demands,"" but that list has practically nothing in common with the viral hoax shown above.

The items on this list are examples of what someone who is unfamiliar with the Black Lives Matter movement may fear are central tenets of this group.:When a similar fake flyer was found in England, a local BLM activist told Scotland's Evening Telegraph:Joy Gansh, a local BLM activist, believes the display was created by people trying to discredit the movement.She said: ""Things like that, after what happened with the George Floyd mural being defaced, I think that's something that a white supremacist would put up to discredit us.""Nobody that I've seen advocating for the BLM movement would think that that is appropriate. My personal opinion is that this is people being framed. This is a way to make us seem in the wrong.""The art student, who plans to organise a BLM march in Dundee soon, believes that ""white supremacists"" are using false posters to encourage violence.""People that hold those kinds of beliefs aren't part of this movement,"" she added. ""This seems like a way to stop us in our tracks and make us seem violent so they can come back with violence. We aren't here for violence, we're just here for justice and equality in all aspects of life."":This fake flyer, as well as similar items, have been pushed on internet forums such as 4chan in an explicit attempt to smear the Black Lives Matter movement. In one post, for example, a 4chan poster states that ""people are falling for this [hoax flyer], let's kick it into overdrive."" In another thread, users exchange various fake BLM posters and encourage each other to share them. In another thread, a user gives instructions on how to make and spread this racist propaganda:The only thing maintaining the completely bizarre state of affairs the USA and the world is in right now is the fact that some white people still think they can be on the ""right side of history"" by kneeling for the Noseberg-controlled BLM movement. We can destroy their whole plan. Make propaganda posters and spread them around. If enough whites realize that blacks will never ever feel that anything is ""enough"", they'll abandon the movement.

They have filed unsuccessful legal challenges seeking to overturn election results in states Biden carried, and they have brought forth witnesses alleging voter fraud who have turned out to be unreliable.The news media calling presidential races is a long-standing tradition that has been in place since the 1800s. The AP first called a race in 1848 for Zachary Taylor.The AP also called the 2016 election for Trump::But after the AP called the 2020 race for Biden, Trump complained about it::So when Ivanka Trump retweeted the AP's announcement that her father was projected to win Alaska and its three electoral college votes with a celebratory message, some called it hypocritical.""Ivanka trusts AP calling Alaska but not AP calling ... the presidency,"" observed Business Insider columnist Manny Fidel, with New York Times national politics reporter Astead Herndon tweeting a rhetorical question, ""so do we trust [AP] or no."""

131,131,449.BlackMobBeatsWhiteMa,"Claim:A white man was beaten by a group of black people for voting Trump.Rating:MixtureAbout this rating What's TrueChicago police are investigating a battery incident involving a 50-year-old white male victim who was attacked by five black males and females.What's FalsePolice say the incident stemmed from a traffic altercation, not politics. :On 10 November 2016, conspiracy theory web site InfoWars posted a video of a white man being pushed and kicked by a group of younger African-American people. (The article bore the inflammatory headline, ""SHOCK VIDEO: BLACK MOB VICIOUSLY BEATS WHITE TUMP VOTER."")The roughly 30-second YouTube video showed an older white man in a blue sweatshirt getting pushed to the ground and kicked by the younger people, while several people can be heard off-camera accusing him of voting for Donald Trump. A longer version of the video posted to Twitter is accompanied by the song ""Fuck Donald Trump,"" and shows the man clinging to his car and being dragged as someone drives away in it. Both the YouTube video and Twitter post have since been deleted.Chicago police told us that officers responded to a battery call on 9 November 2016 in which the 50-year-old victim reported being battered in a traffic-related altercation involving three unidentified males and two females, one of whom drove away in the man's car. A spokeswoman told us::Our Area North detectives are investigating. We're aware of the video. The [incident] report has nothing political in nature. We forwarded the video to detectives, so they're investigating.The man was transported to a nearby hospital in good condition, she said.The victim, David Wilcox, 49, spoke to the Chicago Tribune in an interview published 11 November 2016. He told the paper he did vote for Trump, but no one in the crowd could have known that. He said the crowd was egging on the beating with taunts, but the incident did start with a car accident:A man shown in a viral video getting punched and kicked as a crowd yells, ""Don't vote Trump"" acknowledges he supports Donald Trump but said Thursday that's not what started the beating on the West Side the day after the presidential election.David Wilcox, 49, said he was about to turn left from Kedzie Avenue to Roosevelt Road around 1 p.m. when a black sedan pulled up and scraped the right side of his Pontiac Bonneville.Wilcox said he did vote for Trump, but no one in the crowd would have known that. He said the taunts appeared to come from people watching the beating, including one person at the bus stop who he heard say, ""Yeah, it's one of them white boy Trump guys."":The clip has since been shared by white supremacist publication The Daily Stormer with the following text:We are bringing back law and order to this country.The age of the rabid monkey is closing.Let them take to the streets for their last big hurrah.Because in a couple of short months, America becomes Trumpland.And in Trumpland, criminals are punished with swift brutality. And cops are immune from prosecution.While it's clear Wilcox was assaulted, it seems from initial police reports and his own statements that the assault stemmed from a traffic incident. Bystanders are heard taunting him for voting for Trump, but that's not what the impetus for the beating was.It's also not clear, as some publications are claiming, that the battery suspects in the video were supporters of Trump's Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. One woman can be heard off camera asking, ""Are you gonna pay for my shit?"" which seems to align with the police statement that the fight stemmed from a traffic accident resulting in property damage.:Further, the racial undertones of some of the posts surrounding the video raises the possibility that the incident is being exploited in order to further inflame tensions on the heels of a charged and contentious election.On 22 November 2016, the Chicago Police Department notified us that they were unable to release a copy of the police report because doing so could jeopardize their ongoing investigation into the incident, and because some of those involved are juveniles.On 18 November 2016, the Chicago Tribune reported that three adults and one teenager were charged with one count each of felony vehicular hijacking."
132,132,528.EnfalacandDogFood,"Claim:   A mixture of Enfalac baby formula and dog food caused a toddler's stomach to explode.Status:   False.Example:   [Collected via e-mail, 2000]I'm a long-time journal reader, and I know that a lot of the journallers I read have just had babies. So I have to pass along this warning. My aunt works at the emergency room at the Children's Hospital in Los Angeles.Well, a few weeks ago a woman came in with her six month old daughter, probably the sickest baby she'd ever seen. The doctors examined her and thought she might have appendicitis, so they sent her for an ultrasound.Well, the minute they pressed on her belly, the baby stopped screaming and died right there. She died instantly. Everybody was horrified, and the poor mother was nearly out of her mind. So they did an exam to try and find out what happened, because the doctors had never seen anything like this before. When they did the exam, they discovered that the baby's stomach had exploded!! They took a lot of samples, and when the results came back, nobody could believe it.:It turns out that the mom had given her baby Enfalac baby formula, and put her on the floor to play while she caught up on her housework. Well, the baby crawled over and was chewing on a little bit of leftover dog food when she got sick and started crying.It turns out that Enfalac is still being tested, and it says right on the can not to mix it with penalathelyne phosphate, which is in about every single dog food there is. Nobody ever even imagined that the two could get mixed together, but they did, and the result was just a tragedy.I heard that the mother is suing Enfalac right now, and that maybe the police are going to charge them with something, but everybody wants to keep it quiet. I just couldn't live with myself if I did that, so please, please don't buy Enfalac baby formula. It comes in a pink and blue can, with the name spelled out in yellow ribbons. Please pass this on! Don't let this happen again!!!Origins:   Up until this item, Enfalac's primary connection to the world of urban legends was that they had fallen for the ""Mozart :effect"" canard and announced that they were teaming up with the Grammy Foundation to distribute a ""Smart Symphonies"" CD to new mothers.  (The canard being that ""research"" had indicated that ""babies unconsciously respond to the qualities of classical music, giving them a head start on developing the skills they will need to be proficient in science, math and problem-solving."")  Now they've joined Alka-Seltzer in the heady league of products that supposedly cause stomachs to explode, with the usual ""hush-hush"" conspiracy theory thrown in to boot.Enfalac is a baby formula product marketed by Mead Johnson.It is well out of the ""test"" phase and doesn't cause stomachs to explode, with or without dog food.  This rumor is so far removed from anything even remotely plausible that it must surely be the product of maliciousness rather than misinformation.A quick rundown of the issues: No deaths caused by Enfalac (and no post-mortem exploding stomachs) have been reported in the media any time in the last several years.  If Enfalac were even suspected of causing a death in the fashion described, the story would be all over the news, and every store in North America would already have yanked every can on Enfalac off its shelves.: There is no such substance as ""penalathelyne phosphate.""  Dog foods typically contain potassium compounds more commonly known as potash, but neither potash nor any other substance conceivably found in dog food could possibly combine with Enfalac to cause the effects described here.  Potash is also a common fertilizer; this whole scenario sounds like someone's imagination run amok with the idea that one can create powerful explosives using fertilizer, as was done in the Oklahoma City bombing.  (Phenolphthalein phosphate, also known as PPP, is a real substance, but it's certainly not something found in dog food.)Cans of Enfalac do not carry warnings ""not to mix it with penalathelyne phosphate"" (a non-existent substance) or even phenolphthalein phosphate (a real substance not used in dog food).  Even if they did, this claim is nonsensical: if the makers of Enfalac ""never imagined that the two could get mixed together,"" then why would they have placed a warning against exactly that possibility on the label?  (And how could they possibly have been oblivious to the ""fact"" that the very substance they specifically warned against was found ""in about every single dog food there is""?) ""I heard that the mother is suing Enfalac right now, but everybody wants to keep it quiet.""  Uh-huh.   If your child had just been killed by a baby product that was on the market even though it was ""still being tested,"" because of a danger the manufacturer clearly knew about (since the product label carried a warning about it), would you keep quiet about it?  If you were a typical parent, your tear-streaked face would be on news programs all over the country as you related the horrors of what some callous, greedy, corporate giant's product had done to your poor child.: Although this warning mentions Los Angeles, Enfalac is a product marketed primarily in Canada and Europe, not the U.S. The U.S. equivalent of this product is called Enfamil.  Although it's not impossible to get Enfalac in the U.S., this detail is yet one more inconsistency that casts doubt on the literal truth of this warning.What to make of all this?  People are to willing to believe the worst about infant formulas these days from hearing about the aggressive marketing ploys that Nestle used to push baby formula in third-world countries, a product that reportedly led to the deaths of many infants from malnutrition.  Whatever the motive for this spurious ""warning,"" it's not hard to see why at least some people would be willing to believe it.Last updated:   30 December 2005 "
133,133,362.IsMorganFreemanReall,"Claim:Musician Jimi Hendrix faked his death and is now living as actor Morgan Freeman. Rating:FalseAbout this rating A bizarre conspiracy theory holding that U.S. musician Jimi Hendrix faked his death in 1970 and is now living as renowned actor Morgan Freeman is frequently shared on social media. For instance, Newspunch, a website that has repeatedly trafficked in this sort of misinformation, published an article entitled ""Morgan Freeman is Jimi Hendrix, Researchers Claim"" in May 2018, stating::Jimi Hendrix reinvented himself as actor Morgan Freeman in the 1970's, shortly after faking his own death, researchers claim.According to internet sleuths, Morgan Freeman's sudden rise to fame in the 1970's occurred after Hendrix supposedly died on September 18, 1970.Newspunch later updated the intro and title of this article to make it clear that this rumor originated with conspiracy theorists and not ""researchers"": We have updated the headline and opening of the article to make it clear that while the theory that Jimi Hendrix and Morgan Freeman are the same person is entertaining, it is extremely unlikely to be true.The idea that Freeman is actually Hendrix is largely based on three claims: Freeman and Hendrix are both fans of music; Freeman and Hendrix look alike; and Freeman's acting career didn't take off until after Hendrix' death in 1970.While the first two claims may be accurate, they are also not especially convincing. After all, Freeman and Hendrix are far from the only people who enjoy music. Freeman does own a blues bar in Mississippi, but if liking blues music is the threshold for evidence, it's equally likely that Freeman is actually Robert Johnson, Howlin' Wolf, Freddie King, Little Walter, Big Bill Broonzy, Mississippi John Hurt, T-Bone Walker, or any other famous, deceased blues musician.:Freeman's appreciation for blues music probably speaks more to his upbringing in Memphis, Tennessee, and Chicago, Illinois, than it does to the claim that Freeman is actually a deceased musician. Freeman and Hendrix also do bare a passing resemblance to one another::However, many of the image comparisons accompanying this rumor border on parody. The website WellAware1, for instance, attempted to draw a definitive link between Freeman and Hendrix based on the wrinkles seen in two photographs taken decades apart::Scribbling lines onto a photograph does not constitute evidence.The final claim, holding that Freeman's career didn't begin until after Hendrix's death, is inaccurate. Hendrix died on Sept. 18, 1970. A post-mortem examination found that Hendrix died of ""suffocation due to barbiturate intoxication."" A newspaper clipping on Hendrix' death can be found below: Tue, Sep 29, 1970 - 78 * Chicago Tribune (Chicago, Illinois) * Newspapers.com:While Freeman was not a household name at the time of Hendrix's death, his acting career began prior to 1970. Morgan's first onscreen appearance came in 1964 in a non-credited role in the Sidney Lumet movie ""The Pawnbroker."" Freeman also appeared in at least four stage productions, including ""Hello, Dolly!,"" ""The Dozen,"" and ""Exhibition,"" prior to Hendrix's death. Here's a newspaper clipping from 1969 featuring an unflattering review of ""The Dozens"" published in The Herald-News: Fri, Mar 14, 1969 - 50 * The Herald-News (Passaic, New Jersey) * Newspapers.com:It seems a bit implausible that Hendrix was moonlighting as an actor at the same time he was performing as a musician just so that he could fake his death and pursue a career in the movies.

134,134,330.NoUvaldeShootingVict,"Claim:In May 2022 television interviews, two different ""crisis actors"" portrayed the father of Amerie Jo Garza, who was shot dead in the Uvalde school shooting.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Fact CheckThe Uvalde massacre in May 2022, in which an armed assailant shot dead 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary School, provoked a tsunami of grief and outrage throughout Texas, the United States, and beyond. :Unfortunately, however, it also prompted a grimly predictable slew of conspiracy theories, including the now-familiar ""false flag"" canards, which wrongly claimed the entire atrocity was sinisterly staged or orchestrated in order to advance a political agenda -- typically presented as enhanced gun control.Taking in the grief on the faces of those whose children were slaughtered in their school classroom, it's difficult to imagine that any observer could suggest the whole episode was a hoax and the mourners were ""crisis actors"" (performers who, according to conspiracy theorists, try to convince onlookers that a tragedy had occurred when it actually hadn't). And yet, that's exactly what some self-discrediting websites and activists did.For example, on May 27, the right-wing propaganda site NewsTreason published a post with the headline, ""False Flag? Uvalde Shooting Victim Has Different Fathers on CNN & NBC -- How?"" :The post contained a 90-second video that consisted of heavily-edited excerpts from two television interviews, designed to create the impression that sinister actors, including cable news networks, had staged the Uvalde massacre and used ""crisis actors"" to portray the loved ones of victims. In this particular case, promoters of the conspiracy theory focused on the family of 10-year-old Amerie Jo Garza, a fatal victim of the elementary school shooting.According to the theory, the plotters slipped up by having two different ""actors"" play the same father, thus revealing their chicanery. In reality, the two men interviewed were Garza's stepfather and biological father, each of whom was referred to simply as her father in each interview. On May 25, CNN's Anderson Cooper interviewed Angel Garza, who is the stepfather of Amerie Jo Garza, and husband to the girl's mother, Kimberly Garcia. That interview can be watched in full on YouTube. :On May 26, Savannah Guthrie, presenter of NBC's Today, interviewed Alfred Garza III, who is the biological father of Amerie Jo Garza. That interview can also be watched in full on YouTube. The girl's family relationships were clearly outlined in her obituary, which was published on the website of Hillcrest Memorial Funeral Home in Uvalde on May 25 -- before conspiracy theorists presented the remarks of her two fathers as having no reasonable explanation::Amerie Jo Garza's obituary, which clearly explained that she had both a biological father and stepfather, was freely available online for five days before Charlie Kirk, conspiracy theorist and founder of the right-wing Turning Point USA, promoted the NewsTreason video on Rumble, and to his roughly 2.4 million Facebook followers.

135,135,622.WhatHappensIfTrumpGo,"The House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol began presenting its findings in June 2022. Step by step, soundbite by soundbite, video clip by video clip, the members disclosed puzzle pieces of evidence with, at times, the rhythm of a highly polished documentary film series. As of this writing, the committee seemed to be working towards a very specific aim, and an explosive, unprecedented one at that -- recommending and laying out the path towards a criminal prosecution of former U.S. President Donald Trump.But if the evidence exists to support criminal charges against Trump, the Department of Justice (DOJ) will face a difficult decision over whether to bring him to trial. What are some of the factors it might take into account in making that choice? What are the arguments for and against? Snopes asked experts in law and ethics for their insights and expectations. In all of American history, no prosecutor has ever put a sitting or former president on trial, but it did once happen to a former vice president -- Aaron Burr in 1807. We asked an expert on that case what lessons it held for prosecutors, and what the American public might expect from ""Trump on trial."" :What Criminal Charges Might Trump Face?Trump speaks at a rally on April 2, 2022, near Washington, Michigan. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images):As of this writing, the full scope of evidence and testimony was not publicly known yet, so we can't say for sure what specific charges the committee might recommend. However, so far the members seemed to have their sights set on accusing Trump of committing at least two criminal offenses: Corruptly attempting to obstruct an official proceeding (the counting of electoral votes at the Jan. 6, 2021, joint session of Congress), as outlined in U.S. Code Title 18, Chapter 73, Section 1512(c)(2). This offense carries a potential sentence of up to 20 years in prison. Conspiracy to defraud the United States (by attempting to obstruct the electoral vote count despite likely knowing that plan was illegal), as proscribed in U.S. Code Title 18, Chapter 19, Section 371. This offense carries a potential sentence of up to five years in prison. In federal court filings, the committee explicitly accused Trump of having committed those offenses. In a March 2022 order, U.S. District Court Judge David Carter ruled it was ""more likely than not"" that Trump had indeed committed those offenses. :Separately, federal prosecutors have charged others who were involved in the events of Jan. 6 with the much more serious and somewhat enigmatic offense of seditious conspiracy, which federal statute (U.S. Code, Title 18, Chapter 115, Section 2384) describes as an effort by two or more individuals to: Overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States, or to levy war against them, or to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authority thereof...Seditious conspiracy carries a potential maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. In June 2022, prosecutors charged five prominent members of the far-right Proud Boys group with the offense, for their alleged role in the events of Jan. 6, 2021.Since the aim of Trump's alleged actions, as outlined by the committee, were purportedly in common with those of the Proud Boys -- that is, attempting to block the U.S. government from executing a lawful transfer of presidential power -- then the prospect of federal prosecutors charging Trump himself with seditious conspiracy is one that must not be taken lightly.:Seditious conspiracy is an extremely serious criminal offense. In the U.S. Code, it is listed in the same chapter as treason, rebellion, and insurrection. In the past, prosecutors have used the charge against Islamist terrorists. To prosecute a former American president with any criminal offense would represent an extraordinary first for American politics and criminal justice. To prosecute him for seditious conspiracy, or even conspiracy to defraud the United States, would be an explosive development that could have any number of far-reaching consequences. But, assuming the existing evidence is strong enough to justify going to trial, how should prosecutors weigh such considerations, which stray beyond straightforward calculations involving the facts and the law.Bolstering America's International Reputation -- Is It Too Late?:Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Brazil's former president, greets supporters outside of the Sindicato dos Metalurgicos do ABC on Nov. 9, 2019, in Sao Bernardo do Campo, Brazil. Brazil accepted Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's request for immediate release, according to the country's top court. The iconic leader of the Worker's Party was serving a 12-year sentence since 2018 on corruption charges. (Photo by Pedro Vilela/Getty Images):It's worth noting, again, that a criminal prosecution of a former president would be unprecedented in U.S. history. However, former heads of state or governments have been criminally prosecuted in several other countries, including Ukraine, Brazil, Bolivia and Georgia. One argument against putting Trump on trial is that, by doing so, the DOJ would place the U.S. among a group of nations widely regarded as having an unsteady grip on democracy and difficulties in executing a transfer of power, in particular. Wanting to prevent the United States from arriving at such a scenario, and joining such dubious company, is sensible and understandable, according to Peter Shane, an Ohio State University law professor and expert in presidential powers. However, the actions of Trump and his supporters mean it might already be too late, he told Snopes:On the list of countries where the person who is the head of government is arguably supportive, even, of violent means to stay in power and resist normal constitutional processes -- we're already on that list. So, if we're going to be on that list, then for the Democrats who are in office to say, 'We ought to behave as if we're above it all, institutionally' -- I think could turn out to be a grave mistake.:Preventing Violent Conflict -- At All Costs?Trump supporters near the U.S Capitol, on Jan. 6, 2021, in Washington, DC. (Photo by Shay Horse/NurPhoto via Getty Images):Another argument against indicting Trump is that such a move could significantly inflame political and social tensions in the United States, and provoke acts of violence and terrorism that could eclipse even the Jan. 6 Capitol riots themselves. Those in favor of a criminal trial have a clear answer to those concerns: Violence and division is already upon us, and letting Trump off the hook (if he is guilty) wouldn't fix those problems but could permanently make other matters worse. One expert who favors a criminal prosecution of Trump (if the evidence supports it) is Claire Finkelstein, a professor of law and philosophy and founder of the Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law at the University of Pennsylvania. She told Snopes:We are facing the potential dissolution of our democratic norms, and the fabric that holds our democracy together, in a manner that is as grave as anything we've faced since the Civil War....I appreciate that the U.S. may be on the brink of mass violence, and I think that that has been a long time in coming. But ... there are worse things than violence. We faced violence during the actual Civil War to eliminate slavery in the country. And that was a fight worth fighting. And it was the right thing to do.:The Trial of Aaron Burr, 1807:American politician and vice president to Thomas Jefferson, Aaron Burr, 1756 - 1836. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images)Kent Newmyer, an emeritus professor of law and history at the University of Connecticut and author of a book about the 1807 treason trial of former Vice President Aaron Burr, told Snopes that that episode held important lessons for observers in 2022.The case against Burr was based on unproven claims that he had been plotting, with the aid of British and Spanish contacts, to form a breakaway country in the southwestern United States.Former President Thomas Jefferson, motivated by significant personal and political resentments towards Burr, who had been his vice president, personally interfered in the trial.The jury acquitted Burr but noted that the presiding judge, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall, had restricted the presentation of evidence and imposed a relatively narrow definition of treason. Marshall was, in part, acting out against the interference of Jefferson, with whom he shared a mutual hatred, said Newmyer. :Despite the acquittal, Jefferson succeeded in poisoning public opinion against Burr and ending his political career. Widely perceived as a traitor, the former vice president chose to emigrate to Europe rather than face the opprobrium of his fellow Americans, although he did return home some years later. For Newmyer, the Burr affair preempted the unpredictability and unintended consequences of any potential criminal trial of Trump:There must be the feeling, among people involved in this process, that a trial ... would be highly unpopular and a jury verdict, even if it's against Trump, might actually elevate Trump. Decision-makers in the DOJ are likely speculating, ""even if we win, we might lose,"" Newmyer added. Upholding the Rule of Law, Defending American Democracy:Proud Boys march in support of President Donald Trump in Washington, DC, December 12, 2020. (Photo by Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post via Getty Images)Finkelstein and Shane agree that failing to prosecute Trump, or pardoning him (a potential outcome on which we elaborate below), would not reverse recent trends towards far-right political violence, and it could do great damage to several institutions and principles that are of fundamental importance to American democracy and justice. :Finkelstein said:When you allow government officials to violate the law with impunity, a vast amount of damage is done to the rule of law, to our democracy, to the very concept of ordered liberty. ...If we have presidents that can literally set a mob on our Capitol building in the middle of the transition of power and certification of the votes, then we seriously risk all future transitions of power and the integrity of our electoral system. So, I think there's no choice. If Trump is not prosecuted, despite the putative existence of damning evidence against him, while others (i.e., members of the Proud Boys) face tough penalties for similar crimes, that double standard could further destroy public faith in American politics and the U.S. justice system. Shane said:A lot of Americans are cynical about politics, and cynicism is the enemy of political engagement. 'Why spend my time playing a rigged game?' What is it that leads people to be cynical? I think there are two things. Number one is when people who are elected make promises that they don't keep. But the other thing is when people in powerful positions -- be they public or private -- who do bad things, are not held accountable. :For Finkelstein, Trump's public prominence and influence mean he should bear more responsibility for his actions, not less, especially when less powerful actors are being held to account:So, the lesson would be that we indict the leaders of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys, but not our government officials? So, it's OK for elected officials, senators, congressmen, wives of Supreme Court justices, presidents, cabinet members and so on -- but it's not OK for the little guy? It's not OK for the people who were, in effect, led down that path by members of former administrations? That kind of elitist message is not what we want to send. ... And it sends a message to future politicians that if they make their crimes big enough, and they involve enough people in them, they'll get away with them. Alternative Outcomes:1968 file photo of former President Gerald Ford (right) who pardoned his predecessor Richard Nixon (left) in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal. (Photo by Graphic House/Hulton Archive/Getty Images)If evidence does exist that Trump committed criminal offenses surrounding the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and his efforts to overturn U.S. President Joe Biden's win, there are several potential ways to deal with that, one being a criminal trial, the course of action we've focused on in this article.However, even within that path, several possible outcomes exist. Mark Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, suggested to Snopes one possible outcome that, in his view, might help bring the episode to a relatively satisfactory resolution:Prosecution of the former president followed by a pardon to, once and for all, put these matters in the past.:For his part, Newmyer sees the best -- and perhaps only -- hope of a relatively calm resolution to the episode residing with the U.S. Supreme Court. If Trump is prosecuted and convicted (assuming the evidence supports such a verdict), and that result is appealed and comes before the Supreme Court, whose conservative majority was provided by three Trump appointees, a decision by that particular body to uphold Trump's conviction might have the legitimacy to quieten some outrage. ""If that Trump court came down against Trump, that could have tremendous authority,"" said Newmyer.Finally, it's worth considering another possible course of action that doesn't require a criminal trial, but might be somewhat complicated. Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment states that anyone who has previously sworn an oath to protect the U.S. Constitution, but then engages in ""insurrection or rebellion,"" is, in effect, ineligible to hold public office.A simple majority in the House and Senate could recommend designating Trump ineligible for future election. That vote would not be decisive but could sway a federal court to reach the same conclusion. Trump's legal representatives would likely pursue several arguments against such a ruling, and the process would be relatively complicated.:However, in principle, Section 3 offers an intriguing alternative for those who wish to see Trump barred from ever holding office again, with or without the prospect of a criminal trial and conviction."

138,138,703.ViralVideoCatalyzedR,"On Feb. 12, 2023, Republican U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene championed an unusual cause for a politician traditionally opposed to environmental protection and in support of expansive federal deregulation: an environmental disaster in East Palestine, Ohio caused by a train derailment that likely occurred as a result of poor federal safety regulations. Her interest in the issue does not appear to have been unprompted. Greene's first tweet on the derailment followed the publication of a video that had been distributed by a far-right political group just hours earlier. As Snopes reports here, an increase in right-wing, pundit-based coverage of the derailment followed that video, launching a wide-ranging effort to frame the disaster as an indictment of Biden, the deep state, or other boogeymen associated with the American left. While that early coverage promoted largely factual information about the disaster, the facts fed to this anti-Biden audience were rapidly incorporated into niche narratives, false statements, and full-blown conspiracy theories. Regardless of their bent, each of the narratives promoted by these political groups relied on the false premise that the event received no media coverage before conservative politicians began speaking about it, and that liberal politicians had been ignoring the event. :The Derailment and Early CoverageThe disaster began on Feb. 3, 2023, when a 50-car freight train transporting hazardous chemicals derailed in East Palestine, Ohio. On Feb. 6, fears over the instability of one of those chemicals led the operator, Norfolk Southern Railroad, to begin a ""controlled release"" of the toxic chemical vinyl chloride. That decision led to evacuations and subsequently created a massive and fiery plume of chemicals. Controversy ensued when residents were told, just days later, that it was safe to return to their homes. The presence of dead fish, dead pets, and livestock in the immediate area did not inspire confidence in that assessment. Further complicating things was the delay by the EPA and National Transportation Safety Board in producing a full list of chemicals potentially released into the environment. Still further controversy followed the event when NewsNation reporter Evan Lambert was arrested at a Feb. 8 press conference while reporting during Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine's update on the derailment and environmental fallout. Subsequent video footage shows the altercation began when a National Guard leader told Lambert, aggressively, to be quiet. Later, DeWine spoke out against the arrest and the charges were dropped. Nevertheless, conspiracy theorists used the arrest to support their ""media is being controlled"" narrative. :Contrary to claims made days later, all of these events were well covered in both local and national media outlets. As just one example, here is a snippet of the Washington Posts' pre-Feb. 12 coverage of the disaster::On Feb. 14, pseudoscience and conspiracy website Natural News -- whose own reporting had relied on reporting from the AP, CNN, NewsNation, The Pittsburgh-Post Gazette, and several local news outlets -- described coverage of this event as a ""media blackout.""  Initial Conspiratorial Politicization Though the derailment occurred on Feb. 3 and the chemical release began on Feb. 6, it wasn't until Feb. 12 that the event drew the interest of right-wing pundits. Their interest appears to have followed a video initially produced by a political group named American Virtue, which claimed ""there is currently an ecological disaster in Ohio, and no one in the media is speaking about it.""American Virtue is a project of the far-right American Bull Moose Foundation, and, according to the nonprofit group Political Research Associates, appears ""to be a venue for young White nationalists to curry favor with a new crop of MAGA-aligned political figures."" It is meant to be, that organization reported, at least superficially, a more mainstream version of Nick Fuentes' far-right white nationalist group, America First.:Their video on the East Palestine derailment drew on a narrative that had already been pushed by conspiracy theorists like Stew Peters, who tied the purported lack of mainstream coverage to an obsession with spy balloons and unidentified flying objects. Greene's first tweet took this approach::Both Peters' and Greene's Twitter timelines, it bears mentioning, were filled with conspiracy theories about these objects prior to Feb. 12, and neither made any mention of East Palestine prior to Feb. 12. On the one hand, the issue of train safety is a counter-intuitive policy issue for ""MAGA-aligned"" political figures. In the early days of his administration, former President Trump championed the removal of federal regulations as a policy priority. As part of that effort, Trump repealed relevant regulations that concern the freight train industry, as reported by Lever News on Feb. 8:The sequence of events began a decade ago in the wake of a major uptick in derailments of trains carrying crude oil and hazardous chemicals, including a New Jersey train crash that leaked the same toxic chemical as in Ohio.In response, the Obama administration in 2014 proposed improving safety regulations for trains carrying petroleum and other hazardous materials. .... Then came 2017: After rail industry donors delivered more than $6 million to GOP campaigns, the Trump administration -- backed by rail lobbyists and Senate Republicans -- rescinded part of that rule aimed at making better braking systems widespread on the nation's rails.Specifically, regulators killed provisions requiring rail cars carrying hazardous flammable materials to be equipped with electronic braking systems to stop trains more quickly than conventional air brakes. :On the other hand, however, sowing mistrust of federal agencies during an environmental disaster that occurred under a Democratic administration affecting a large share of White conservative voters offered plenty to pundits suddenly interested in pushing narratives about East Palestine, and was immediately popular with their audiences. Early narratives focused on the vague but popular notion that the media or government is manipulating the general public, making similar references to UFOs as Peters and Greene. For example, Turning Point USA's Benny Johnson, whose timeline was full of spy balloon based content beforehand, implied in a Feb. 13 tweet that the news about unidentified objects in space was a distraction from government malfeasance related to the derailment: :Hours later, former Trump 2016 campaign staffer and right-wing influencer George Papadapolous made the same vague allegation:'War on White People' Politicalization Eventually more specific narratives emerged, including those in line with American Virtue's alleged political bent toward white nationalism. Far-right figures alleged that the largely white population of the region is why the Biden Administration had not taken the incident seriously. As reported by Media Matters, right-wing pundit Charlie Kirk alleged on Feb. 14 that Biden's inaction was part of a ""war on white people""::Not a single member of the Biden regime would dare to go to this portion of Ohio and breathe in the air because they know it's dangerous. They know that it is actively poisoning the citizens of eastern Ohio. So, why is it that they kind of shrug their shoulders and they say, yeah, okay, whatever? It's very simple. It's because the war on white people continues. Why would you care for the white working class voters in eastern Ohio? You haven't cared about them in other reasons or other portions.And I will prove it to you. If this train derailment happened in downtown Atlanta in the densely populated Black neighborhoods, this would be the number one news story. It would be Flint water crisis 2.0. There would be clamoring and activism and talks for reparations. And Buttigieg, meanwhile, is out there saying, listen -- while this derailment is happening, while the act of poisoning is happening, he's saying, look, the problem is that workers are too white. Fox News host Jesse Waters also promoted this talking point on Feb. 13, in his criticism of current EPA Commissioner Micheal Reagan, who is Black:Does this guy Reagan even know anything about the environment? Well, we looked into him, and the only reason he was nominated to run the EPA was because he promised to fight off environmental racism. Is this his idea of fighting environmental racism? Spilling toxic chemicals on poor white people in Ohio? He doesn't have time to worry about a cloud bomb of toxic fumes over Ohio?:On Feb. 14, Tucker Carlson claimed on his primetime show that the demographics and politics of the region were not of interest to Biden or his administration:East Palestine is overwhelmingly white and it's politically conservative. ... That shouldn't be relevant but as you're about to hear, it very much is. ...Imagine if this happened in, well, the favored cities of Philadelphia and Detroit ... in both cases, had it affected the rich or the favored poor, it would be the lead of every news channel in the world. But it happened to the poor, benighted town of East Palestine, Ohio, whose people are forgotten and, in the view of the people who lead this country, forgettable.The Bottom LineMany in both the Democratic party and the GOP were quiet about the East Palestine train disaster for days. It was not until a political group's talking points emerged and were shared widely on social media that the issue reached late-night pundits. By then, the claims had become both conspiratorial -- ""the government and media are lying to you"" -- and tied to popular conservative talking points -- ""Democrats don't care about working-class conservative White Americans."" :These narratives are propelled by two flawed assertions. First, they rely on claims that there has been a media blackout -- a notion belied by the media's daily reporting on the disaster and these political groups' use of that reporting to make their arguments. Second, they rely on the notion that only GOP aligned pundits or politicians are discussing the disaster. This is also not true.There has, in fact, been bipartisan concern about the causes of the disaster and how it was subsequently handled. Further, Republican and Democratic politicians and members of the Biden EPA visited the site of the derailment on Feb. 16, 2023, as reported by Fox News::The administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Sens. JD Vance and Sherrod Brown will visit the train derailment site in East Palestine Thursday, a day after Norfolk Southern snubbed residents by skipping out on an informational town hall, citing safety concerns for employees.Vance, a Republican newly sworn into office at the start of the year, will hold his own press conference at 11:15 a.m. - an hour and half before Brown, a Democrat, will join Michael Regan, the EPA administrator under the Biden administration, for an event of their own at the East Palestine derailment site.Vance sent a letter to the CEO of Norfolk Southern requesting the company expand its existing reimbursement program to include all East Palestine residents. He and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., sent a letter to Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg demanding answers on the derailment.Together, Vance and Brown, as well as Sens. Bob Casey and John Fetterman, both Democrats representing Pennsylvania, sent a letter to Regan raising concerns about the release of hazardous chemicals in East Palestine. The quartet has also sent a letter to the chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board highlighting rail safety concerns.:There is no question that the East Palestine derailment is a massive environmental disaster, a failure at multiple corporate and government levels, and a potential health risk for years to come. Sadly, such a disaster provides clout-seeking pundits with fodder to push inflammatory arguments for political gain. All it took, in this case, was a little push from an outside political group and a tweet by a politician in their orbit. "
139,139,471.DidThesePoliticiansB,"Claim:Photographs show walls around the homes of President Obama, Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, Dianne Feinstein and Maxine Waters.Rating:MixtureAbout this rating As the year 2018 drew to a close, many pundits maintained that it was hypocritical for (Democratic) politicians to oppose funding the construction of a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico while simultaneously themselves living in homes surrounded by walls.   (For the purposes of this article, we will eschew dwelling on the differences between walls and fences, and on the multiple uses of walls and fences for purposes other than keeping out intruders.):In February 2018, for example, photographs supposedly showing walls around the homes of U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-California) and Rep. Joe Kennedy III's (D-Mass.) were circulated, along with disparaging messages labeling the two politicians as hypocrites. (Neither of the photographs used in those rumors actually featured the homes of Pelosi or Kennedy.):Then in December 2018, President Donald Trump picked up the line of attack when he (falsely) claimed that former president Barack Obama's Washington, D.C., residence had a ""ten-foot wall"" around the property:President and Mrs. Obama built/has a ten foot Wall around their D.C. mansion/compound. I agree, totally necessary for their safety and security. The U.S. needs the same thing, slightly larger version!-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 30, 2018This same argument has been used to disparage other politicians.  In January 2019, a set of images supposedly showing walls around the homes of the Obamas, Nancy Pelosi, the Clintons, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), and U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) was also circulated on social media :This meme was inaccurate in several ways, including the use of misleading photographs.Barack Obama:The photograph labeled ""Obama"" truly shows a portion of Barack and Michelle Obama's current residence in Washington, D.C. However, the claim that the home is surrounded by a 10-foot wall is inaccurate.:As a former president of the United States, Barack and Michelle Obama (as well as all other former presidents and their spouses) are afforded the lifelong protection of the Secret Service under the Former Presidents Protection Act of 2012.  Certain security features were therefore added to the Obamas' home in order to facilitate the Secret Service's ability to perform their protection activities.  For instance, a guard booth was constructed near the front door of the home, brick pillars and fencing were added to the retaining wall in the front of the house, and a chain-link fence was added to the back. :However, the Obamas' home is not surrounded by a 10-foot wall.  The house is still clearly visible from the streets, and photographs document that the stairway leading from the main entrance of the home down to the street is not impeded by a wall, fence, or security gate, as the Washington Post noted:A neighbor, a longtime resident of the area who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preserve their privacy, said Trump ""has a very active imagination.""""There's a fence that goes along the front of the [Obamas'] house, but it's the same as the other neighbors have,"" the neighbor said. ""It's tastefully done.""Another neighbor said the Obamas' home is ""100 percent visible from the street.""""There is no 10-foot wall in the front, back or sides of the house -- and no wall is going up,"" the person said.Hillary Clinton:Former president Bill Clinton and his spouse, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, maintain a residence in Chappaqua, New York, which they purchased in November 1999 while Bill Clinton was still President of the United States.  Shortly afterwards, an eight-foot tall fence was installed around the border of the property, along with a gate and security office: :Again, how much of that construction might have been undertaken in order the facilitate the activities of the Secret Service protective detail is difficult to determine.  The New York Daily News reported in December 1999 that four Secret Service agents had participated in presenting a plan to the local zoning board for a variance to construct an 8-foot-tall fence around the Clinton property (since the zoning laws in the area at the time prohibited fences higher than 6 feet) and to install a guard booth near the entrance. Both proposals were approved:[T]he zoning board of appeals for the town of New Castle voted unanimously to approve variances for an 8-foot-tall white-stained cedar fence. The Clintons sent four Secret Service agents to present their application to the board, because town zoning rules prohibit fences higher than 6 feet. The fence, which will come right down to the edge of the street, will block any views of the house and eliminate a favorite path for neighborhood kids who cut through the house's backyard ...The zoning board also gave approval for a 4-by-6-foot guardhouse -- with a turret -- just inside the gate. While residents criticized the Clintons' plans for the house, no one showed up at the meeting to protest, said board chairman Gabriel Rosenfeld.:Nancy PelosiWhen a similar rumor was circulated about Rep. Nancy Pelosi in February 2018, the purveyors of that misinformation used a photograph of Pelosi's San Francisco neighborhood, but not one of her actual house. In this case it appears the image actually used a photograph of a property owned by Pelosi (although we aren't entirely sure). Regardless, it's unlikely that the pictured ""wall"" provides any significant security, as it is only a foot or two high. Furthermore, the largely decorative wall only covers the entrance and does not surround the entire property.:Pelosi and her husband, Paul Pelosi, own an estate and vineyard along the banks of the Napa River on Zinfandel Lane in Northern California. The image purportedly showing Pelosi's estate in this meme was found by the sleuths at the American Mirror (a hyperpartisan website that frequently publishes questionable content) using Google Maps. Although we've yet to come across a listed address for this property, we examined aerial images of this street and agree that the image likely shows the entrance of the Pelosi's estate, as it is the only property bordering the Napa River and Zinfandel Lane that appears to be worthy of the reported $5-$20 million value.However, the pictured wall is simply a stone border wall that doesn't encircle the entire property and is no more than a few feet high::Photographs of another home owned by Pelosi in San Francisco show that that property is not surrounded by walls, either:Dianne Feinstein:The image labeled ""Feinstein"" was originally published by The Daily Caller in a 2013 article about a small fire near the senator's residence in D.C. that required the response of emergency crews. Although the address listed in that report matched the address in a 2001 Washington Life article about the Feinstein's home, we have not been able to verify if the senator still maintains a residence at this address.The view of this property from OpenStreetMap appears to show the it is surrounded by a fence about five feet high::Maxine WatersThe image labeled ""Waters"" in this graphic was originally circulated online with a different criticism of the politician. When the conspiracy-driven True Pundit website published this photograph in April 2017, they were describing Waters as a hypocrite for living in a mansion while fighting for the poor. The photograph they published of the front of this Hancock Park, California, residence clearly showed it was not surrounded by a wall, however::Although the residence is flanked by a brick wall along one side, other images of the residence -- including a video shot by Omar Navarro as he announced his candidacy for Congress in front of Maxine Waters house -- show the rest of the property to be completely open::"

Photographs of these visits started to make their way around the internet about the same time a few news outlets published reports that some of the victims were unwilling to meet with the president. This may have led some people to believe that Trump had staged these photographs using ""crisis actors."":One photograph in particular, which showed Trump standing next to a young woman in a hospital bed, was widely shared on Twitter with the claim that it showed ""Emma Breier,"" the daughter of American diplomat Kimberly Breier, and that the latter was merely posing as a victim:This claim is not based on medical records or firsthand reporting, and it did not originate with credible sources. The claim hinges almost entirely on the notion that these two people bear a passing resemblance to one another, and was apparently prompted by reports that no children were injured in the shooting. However, the assumption that the patient shown with the Trumps is the same age as Emma Breier (much less the same person) is based solely on appearances. Although the hospital wouldn't divulge personal details about the patients, a representative did confirm to Snopes that all the survivors treated there in the wake of the massacre were adults. :The image on the left of the above-displayed meme was uploaded to the White House's official Flickr account on Aug. 7, along with several of other images from Trump's visit to the Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton. It was accompanied by the following caption: ""President Donald J.

A closer look reveals several notable differences. For one, the young woman who was injured during the Dayton shooting has brown hair (see below-right), compared to Breier's black hair (below-left). The shooting victim also has attached earlobes, whereas Breier's are free. Some notable differences in facial structure are also apparent, such as the shape of their noses, chins, and eyes::We should also note that this woman was not the only mass-shooting survivor that Trump met with in Dayton. While some victims in El Paso were unwilling to meet with Trump -- the El Paso shooting is being investigated as an act of domestic terrorism and possible hate crime and many critics have connected it to Trump's incendiary anti-immigration rhetoric -- that didn't seem to be as much of an issue in Dayton. Trump visited with a few other victims at the Miami Valley Hospital.In other words, it wouldn't make much sense (even by conspiracy-theory standards) to stage one photograph with a ""crisis actor"" while Trump was photographed with several other real victims:Given the information available, we rate this claim ""False."":"

The story implied that the mRNA (messenger RNA) used in COVID-19 vaccines such as the Pfizer and Moderna shots could result in blocking or altering proteins that the body uses to fight tumor growth. Natural News based this comically flawed conclusion solely on a news release that described research performed by a team at the Sloan Kettering Institute on a wholly unrelated topic that was published in 2018 -- well before the emergence of COVID-19.The research that Natural News mangled in its story concerns a specific kind of blood cancer known as chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Cancerous cells in this disease do not always present many (or sometimes any) mutations or alterations in their DNA. This is counterintuitive, because DNA coding errors are broadly thought to be the cause of the uncontrolled cell division that characterizes cancer. The Sloan Kettering researchers proposed a mechanism to explain the discrepancy. The scientists posited that ""mRNA itself may carry cancer-causing changes"" through transcription errors that produce proteins which interfere with anti-tumor cells.:Natural News used this finding to suggest that all mRNA -- a genetic molecule needed to create proteins which necessarily exists in all the cells of all the life forms that have ever existed on this planet -- is itself a cancer causing agent.

This is the complete opposite of what the CDC and the vaccine manufactures are telling everyone right now about the Covid vaccines.""Here's the problem with authoring a fear-mongering article about a biologically necessary molecule: It might make you look like a charlatan who has never heard of RNA and who -- perhaps on a deadline -- typed the words ""mRNA"" and ""cancer"" into a search engine, found a press release, and decided that your work was done.Below, we explain why this approach failed.How Do mRNA Vaccines Work?:To understand a mRNA vaccine, as we explained in an earlier debunker, one first has to understand the basics of how cells and the genetic material they contain work. A cell contains a nucleus, which is separated from the rest of the cell by a membrane known as the nuclear envelope, and the cytoplasm, which contains several organelles floating around in the non-nucleus part of the cell. An organism's primary genetic material is a series of DNA molecules known as chromosomes that are found in the nucleus. The code contained in these chromosomes, essentially a massive library of protein creating instructions, is what is passed onto new cells when a cell makes copies of itself.The DNA, stored away safely in the nucleus, gives instructions to the rest of the cell on what proteins to build. To make a long story short, these instructions are sent from the nucleus of the cell in the form of messenger RNA (mRNA), which travels through the cell's cytoplasm into an organelle called the ribosome. The ribosome is kind of like a protein-creating factory, and the mRNA is akin to a work order sent by floppy drive to the factory.The goal of a mRNA vaccine is to get a ""work order"" to the cell's ribosome that did not originate in the nucleus. Instead, mRNA vaccines bypass entirely anything to do with the nucleus of a cell by introducing small bits of mRNA that are able to enter a cell's cytoplasm pre-programmed with a specific ""work order"" to produce a spike protein associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. By generating these proteins, a person's immune system creates antibodies against those spikes without being exposed to the virus itself.:Why Is the Sloan Kettering Research Not Relevant to mRNA Vaccines?The only connection between the Sloan Kettering research and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines is that both areas of scientific inquiry use the word ""mRNA."" The Sloan Kettering researchers were studying specific kinds of gene transcription errors that occur during the transfer, via mRNA, of genetic information from the nucleus of a cell to the protein-factory that is the ribosome.As described in the 2018 Sloan Kettering news release, the length of the gene-producing code transcribed by the mRNA is often shorter than the DNA found in the nucleus from which it was copied. ""That's because the useful pieces of information in DNA, called exons, are often separated by blocks of sequences that are not needed. These unnecessary parts, called introns, must be cut out to make a final product."":Problems can occur, however, if the mRNA copy is truncated -- i.e., missing important protein-coding sequences found on a gene's exon. In those cases, ""the protein made from that mRNA will also be truncated. It may no longer function properly.""  The specific hypothesis proposed by the Sloan Kettering team concerned a blood cancer known as chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In that disease, they suggested, mRNA transcription errors could lead to truncated and broken tumor suppressing proteins and therefore the promotion of tumor growth.Such a finding could be significant, as it would provide a mechanism for chronic lymphocytic leukemia specifically, and potentially other cancers in general, that would not show up on DNA tests. ""These findings help explain a long-standing conundrum, which is that [chronic lymphocytic leukemia] cells have relatively few known DNA mutations,"" the news release explained. ""In effect, the mRNA changes that [Sloan Kettering researcher] Dr. Mayr's team discovered could account for the missing DNA mutations."" The findings are significant for understanding cancer in general, and for cancer diagnostics specifically. ""Cancer diagnostics may need to change to include these previously unknown cancer drivers,"" the news release concluded.:The findings have zero relevance to mRNA vaccines. That's because there is no point in time during the vaccination process for a mRNA transcription error. mRNA transcription errors occur during interaction with nuclear DNA. As previously mentioned, mRNA vaccines don't interact with the nucleus of a cell. As such, the process that would impart these potential transcription errors is literally not involved at any point during COVID-19 vaccination.The mRNA contained in COVID-19 vaccines is a specific, synthetically created bit of code that is completely ready for the ribosome. The creation of synthetic mRNA has long been possible, and is a common part of genetic research. The process means we know exactly, down to the specific genetic sequence, what mRNA is being introduced in our body. Because this code requires no cellular-level copying before it performs its function, there is no chance for the aforementioned transcription errors.The Bottom Line:Natural News appears to be under the impression it has uncovered a huge medical secret about mRNA. Its claim is comically simple: mRNA (doesn't matter what kind) causes cancer. In reality, the research Natural News invoked suggests that mRNA transcription errors -- not the blanket appearance of a molecule in every cell in every organism on Earth -- can create flawed proteins to suppress anti-cancer activity leading to or exacerbating one specific form of cancer.Transcription errors hold no relevance to mRNA vaccines because the entire transcription process is bypassed at the cellular level. Further, the proteins created by the mRNA sequences studied at Sloan Kettering have no relevance to COVID-19 spike proteins. After Natural News published its piece, Sloan Kettering had to add a boldface disclaimer to the news release: ""It's important to note that mRNAs are a normal component of all cells and the specific ones discussed here are not involved in mRNA-based vaccines, like the one developed against SARS-CoV-2.""Because mRNA transcription errors invoked in a 2018 study on an unrelated disease refer to genetic sequences, proteins, and cellular mechanisms that are not present, created, or utilized in COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, and because the researchers who wrote the paper that Natural News exclusively relied on reject the interpretation made of their work, the claim is ""False."":"

As a result of this, an airplane filled with Afghan Heroin and North Korean amphetamines was impounded at Argyle International Airport on St. Vincent and the Grenadines in the Caribbean, the sources say. The money raised from this drug flight was intended to be used to finance the operations of Daesh (formerly known as ISIS), the sources say.

Billy Graham once said, ""The hard right has no interest in religion except to manipulate it.""Rating:TrueAbout this rating While evangelical leader Franklin Graham has been a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, his father Rev. Billy Graham publicly warned against the prospect of religious figures becoming too attached to a political stance.Several readers contacted us in January 2018 seeking to confirm a statement attributed to the elder Graham::I don't want to see religious bigotry in any form. It would disturb me if there was a wedding between the religious fundamentalists and the political right. The hard right has no interest in religion except to manipulate it.The statement was also circulated online in meme form::In this case, the quote is authentic, and taken from the 1 February 1981 cover story in Parade magazine; it was part of Billy Graham's account of conversations with fellow reverend Jerry Falwell, who helmed the conservative politcal group the Moral Majority. Graham said:I told him to preach the Gospel. That's our calling. I want to preserve the purity of the Gospel and the freedom of religion in America. I don't want to see religious bigotry in any form. Liberals organized in the '60s, and conservatives certainly have a right to organize in the '80s, but it would disturb me if there was a wedding between the religious fundamentalists and the political right. The hard right has no interest in religion except to manipulate it.The statement was featured early on in the story and was also highlighted below a picture of Falwell and then-President Ronald Reagan:::In the story, Graham admitted that he no longer thought of Communists as being ""disciples of Lucifer,"" contrary to his own rhetoric from earlier in his career. He also cast himself as having no part of Falwell's organization, which became a key conservative constituency before dissolving in 1989. He said:It would be unfortunate if people got the impression all evangelists belong to that group. The majority do not. I don't wish to be identified with them. I'm for morality. But morality goes beyond sex to human freedom and social justice. We as clergy know so very little to speak out with such authority on the Panama Canal or superiority of armaments. Evangelists can't be closely identified with any particular party or person. We have to stand in the middle to preach to all people, right and left. I haven't been faithful to my own advice in the past. I will be in the future.While the elder Graham has had relationships with several U.S. presidents spanning decades, he told Christianity Today in 2011 that, given the chance to do anything differently in his life, ""I also would have steered clear of politics.""His son, on the other hand, has positioned himself as a Trump supporter since 2011, when he contributed to the debunked ""birther"" conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. In October 2016, the younger Graham published a social media post (misattributed to his father) urging evangelical voters to vote for Trump.:More recently, Franklin Graham has refused to criticize the president for reportedly calling African countries ""shitholes"" or for alleged extramarital affairs -- drawing criticism from Graham's own niece -- and claimed that the U.S. was ""in a coup d'etat"" perpetrated by political enemies of Trump who were using the media against him."

Les Echos is known for serious reporting on economic and political issues. They do not publish celebrity gossip.

And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. :On July 28, 2021, internet personality Stew Peters landed what he described as an ""exclusive"" scoop: a video interview with what he billed as Pfizer insider Karen Kingston who, Peters claimed, produced ""indisputable documentation"" that proves mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) contain a ""poison"" known as graphene oxide.The video went viral, despite the fact that Kingston produced no such documentation, and despite the reality that her tenure at Pfizer, according to her LinkedIn profile, involved marketing cardiovascular therapies to healthcare providers in Manhattan from 1996 to 1998 -- well over a decade before pharmaceutical companies had any interest in mRNA vaccines.Graphene oxide is an ultrathin material with unique electrostatic properties popular with conspiracy theorists because of its application in various experimental technologies. The conspiracy theory promoted on the ""Stew Peters Show"" suggests that the vaccines secretly contain undisclosed graphene oxide to test how much their bodies could hold for future graphene-oxide-based mind control shenanigans or perhaps, as Kingston described the vaccines in her interview, for ""planned genocide."":PETERS: There is a legitimate theory that these shots are actually designed to create some sort of connectivity between humans, 5g, whatever this is controlling, your thoughts, your memories, all of these things. I mean, those are realistic and plausible.KINGSTON: That's not possible with this round. They rushed this thing out. They're just seeing, you know, how much they could put into people before they die, I think, honestly.Graphene oxide is not included in the ingredient lists of any filings for either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. Speaking to Reuters, Pfizer's senior associate of global media relations said that, ""Graphene oxide is not used in the manufacture of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine."" Arguments suggesting that they do, therefore, rest on ""independent research"" that purports to have uncovered nefarious secrets by scouring the internet for hints.Kingston lays out her research process in the interview, which makes it easy to spot how and where she either distorts or misinterprets the information her argument rests on. The messenger RNA in COVID-19 vaccines is protected by a lipid nanoparticle layer that also allows it to enter the non-nuclear portion of a cell. The specific lipid formulations used by both Pfizer and Moderna differ, but both include at least one chemical classified as a PEGylated lipid. Such lipids have had a polymer named polyethylene glycol added to them.:Kingston's argument rests on two deeply flawed assertions: that the only company in the world that produces PEGylated lipids is the Chinese company Sinopeg and that documentation on Sinopeg's website proves that graphene oxide is present in their products. Neither assertion, however, bears any semblance to reality.Sinopeg Does Not Produce Lipids for Pfizer or ModernaChemicals have multiple names and IDs. Kingston explained that she found the website for Sinopeg by entering the chemical names or ID numbers of two of the lipid chemicals listed in the Pfizer emergency use application (ALC-0315 and ALC-0159) in a search engine and discovered Sinopeg sells both on its website. ""I didn't find Sinopeg by Googling 'Sinopeg.' I literally put in the MSDS CAS number,"" referring to an ID given to industrial chemicals.Kingston's implicit assumption is that no other company in the world sells these chemicals. ""So it's right there. It's being manufactured in China,"" she asserted, after sharing the above fact as evidence. This is a deeply flawed assumption. A search for the lipids ALC-0315 (2036272-55-4) and ALC-0159 (1849616-42-7) reveals a panoply of companies that also sell these and other lipids, including the ones in Pfizer's vaccine. As just two examples, the company in Watertown, Massachusetts, Biochempeg sells ALC-0159 and New Jersey-based company MedChemExpress sells ALC-0315 to qualified researchers.:More to the point, however, U.K.-based company Croda produces lipids for Pfizer. Moderna does not use any of the lipids discussed above and instead uses proprietary PEGylated lipid SM-102 that is produced in its own manufacturing facility in Massachusetts. This fact makes Kingston's second argument, which relies on information from Sinopeg's website, even more misguided than it already is.A Paper About Graphene Oxide On Sinopeg's Website Has Nothing To Do With VaccinesIn the interview, Kingston highlights the presence of an academic paper on Sinopeg's website that uses the words ""graphene oxide"" as evidence, apparently, that this chemical is in the vaccine. ""They explained here on Sinopeg that [graphene oxide] is the core shell structured polyethylene glycol, functionalized graphene for energy storage, polymer, polymer, dielectric, combined mechanical and dialect performances,"" she said, repeating several impressive words from the paper's title.   :This paper, originally published in the journal Composites Science and Technology, has nothing to do with vaccines or with Sinopeg. The research was not performed, written, or funded by Sinopeg. It is catalogued on the company's website under ""industry news"" because it discussed a potential method to modify the solubility of graphene oxide (which becomes less soluble over time when employed for energy storage) using PEGylated lipids -- the product Sinopeg is known for --  in its manufacturing process. This appears to be Kingston's entire link to graphene oxide: a wholly unrelated research paper reproduced in the industry news section of a company website that has nothing to do with Pfizer or Moderna.This is far from ""irrefutable evidence"" and -- it bears mentioning -- does not come from any sort of inside information gathered from Kingston's two years in Pfizer's marketing department in the 1990s, despite Peters hyping her as an insider. Earlier Claims About Graphene Oxide? Still Wrong!:The Kingston interview is the latest in a long series of dubious claims about graphene oxide and COVID-19 vaccines, but other so-called ""experts"" have produced what conspiracy theorists consider to be evidence of its presence in COVID-19 vaccines.In an interview on the same show from a few weeks earlier, Peters interviewed an ""expert"" who claimed -- based on a ""study"" from Spain's University of Almeria -- that COVID-19 vaccines are ""virtually 99.99% graphene oxide."" As described by medical fact-checker HealthFeedback, this ""study"" -- which was denounced by the University, not peer-reviewed, and launched in response to a request made by a prolific spreader of vaccine misinformation  -- ""compared images obtained via electron microscopy .. of graphene oxide, and ... a liquid that, according to the document, could be the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, although the product's 'origin and traceability is unknown'.""Experts interviewed by Health Feedback said the photographs taken of both liquids could be anything, and the outlet noted that the ""author acknowledges that a vial arrived by 'courier' service, but that he doesn't know its traceability."" In the scientific world, such a sample would be considered 'trash.':Even more problematic for those who claim that graphene oxide has been added to mRNA vaccines is the coloring. These vaccines are clear to mildly cloudy, but as highlighted by Reuter's, Matthew Diasio, an American Chemical Society Congressional Science & Engineering fellow, stated that a sample that contained even 1% of graphene oxide would look dark if not black. This is simply not what the vaccines look like.In sum, no credible evidence has been presented to suggest the presence of graphene oxide in COVID-19 vaccines, and Kingston's ability to Google CAS numbers does not change this reality. As such, we rank the claim ""False."""
149,149,510.GawkerFilesforBankru,"Gawker Media has filed for bankruptcy, and founder Nick Denton says he plans to sell the company. The move comes after a judge in Florida reportedly allowed a $140 million dollar judgment against Gawker to stand.Gawker's legal troubles began in 2012, with publication of sex tape footage involving wrestler Terry G. Bollea, better known as Hulk Hogan. Bollea initially sought $100 million in damages in his suit against the company for its release of a video of him having sex with the wife of a radio shock jock.  In March 2016, a jury awarded Bollea $115 million and then an additional $25 million in punitive damages. The New York Times reported that Gawker Media planned to auction off its assets and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after the stay was denied:Gawker Media, under pressure from a $140 million legal judgment in an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit by the former wrestler Hulk Hogan, is putting itself up for sale, according to a person briefed on the plan. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Friday after a judge overseeing the suit against the company entered the full judgment and denied Gawker's request for a stay under terms the company could meet.The company is beginning an auction, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the auction has not been announced. ZiffDavis, a digital media company, has submitted an opening bid of $90 million to $100 million, the person said.:Hollywood Reporter published details of the bankruptcy filing, noting that an individual not party to the case (Peter Thiel) assisted Bollea legally, purportedly as retribution for the site outing him and publishing unflattering posts about him in 2007:According to bankruptcy papers, Gawker has also secured a $7.66 million loan from Silicon Valley Bank with a line of credit of $5.3 million. Additionally, it's got a second credit agreement worth $15 million with US VC Partners. All told, that's $22 million in debtor financing as Gawker aims to restructure itself and fight off collection efforts from Hogan as its dispute with the former professional wrestler goes to an appeals court.Hogan, of course, is listed as the biggest unsecured creditor in a disputed claim. The wrestler whose real name is Terry Bollea filed suit against Gawker after a post in Oct. 2012 about the wonders of watching celebrity sex. In March, a two-week trial was held that resulted in a victory for Hogan as well as Thiel, who provided secret financial backing after being the target of unflattering posts on Gawker's former site, Valleywag.Gawker founder Nick Denton told the Observer that the company considered the ""revenge-funder idea as too evil to be true,"" adding that ""in retrospect all along there were some obvious signs."" Those ""signals"" included the plaintiff's lack of inclination to settle out of court, his opting for a public trial in a case involving a sex tape, and his refusal to work out a deal in a manner covered by Gawker media's insurance. The Observer noted that the Thiel connection was widely considered little more than a conspiracy theory until May 2016::During the trial, conspiracy theories began gaining steam. Dan Abrams floated the possibility on his legal news site LawNewz, wondering whether there was anything to the tip he had received that some Tampa lawyers believed a benefactor had agreed to cover Hogan's legal fees. When the Observer covered the trial, a Gawker employee mused over drinks about the odd coincidence that one of Hogan's lawyers, Charles J. Harder, also represented multiple other plaintiffs suing Gawker.""I had heard the rumors towards the end of the trial and I had reached out to the Gawker folks about it,"" New York Times DealBook columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin said in an email. ""At the time, it all seemed a bit conspiratorial. I told them if Nick ever wanted to talk about it, I'd love to discuss it.""In April, Ryan Mac, a San Francisco-based Forbes reporter, got a tip during an unrelated meeting with a source that there was more to the Hogan/Gawker lawsuit.""It was too strange of a tip not to follow up on,"" Mac said. ""This wasn't something I was hearing every day ... Our first reaction was that it was just too crazy to be true,"" said Mac. ""Everyone I talked to said they had never heard of this before. Nobody could even fathom someone thinking of a plan to do something like that."":Thiel himself, however, admitted to a ""covert war"" against Gawker after the reporters substantiated the rumors via unnamed sources:""Not until the Forbes story did we know for sure that there was a funder, and that the funder was perhaps the most successful investor in Silicon Valley pursuing a decade-long grudge,"" Denton said, although he has said that Thiel was on a short list of tech billionaires he suspected.A spokesperson for Thiel declined to comment to Forbes, but nobody disputed the report ... after the Forbes story went online, in an interview with Sorkin, Thiel admitted to financing several lawsuits in a years-long covert war against Gawker and estimated that what he called ""one of my greater philanthropic things that I've done"" cost him around $10 million dollars.The New Yorker pondered whether Thiel's successful machinations against one of the largest new media conglomerates was the beginning of a larger threat to press freedoms and protections in an ever-changing landscape of reporting:At the moment, what seems most important about the Hulk Hogan case is last week's revelation that Hogan's legal costs were borne by Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley billionaire on whom Gawker has been inflicting pain for years. The story has been that Thiel is out for revenge against Gawker and its founder, Nick Denton, and may well get it, in the form of a forced sale or even Gawker's going out of business. The stakes may actually be bigger than that. Remember that Thiel is a graduate of Stanford Law School who clerked for a year on the Eleventh Circuit, and that, in his world, ""scale"" and ""disruption"" are the hoped-for ends of every investment. He is surely aware of this case's potential to begin a reexamination of the fundamental questions in American press law, far beyond the fate of Gawker.:Gawker says it has entered a purchasing agreement with Ziff Davis, a global digital media company."

Rating:MixtureAbout this rating What's TrueThe singer in this video, Sailor Sabol, performed the national anthem on the first day of CPAC 2021. What's FalseHowever,  the portion of this video featuring a befuddled piano accompanist was created as a joke, and did not air at CPAC. Claims that the singer was ""Ted Cruz's dog walker"" and that this performance occurred just before former U.S. President Donald Trump's speech are false. :In February 2021, as conservatives gathered in Orlando, Florida, for the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), a video went viral on social media that supposedly showed how the conference began with a messy rendition of the national anthem. The viral CPAC national anthem video features a split screen. On one side, there's a singer. And on the other, we see a pianist rush to his seat and hurriedly prepare himself to play as a voice off camera can be heard saying ""don't screw this up."" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdgT0hX1swc&feature=emb_titleThe video on the right features a genuine video from CPAC. The video on the left does not. This rendition of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" was performed by singer Sailor Sabol. While some on social media claimed that this singer is also Ted Cruz's dog walker (a reference to a misleading claim about the Texas senator ""abandoning"" his dog when he traveled to Cancun, Mexico, during a severe winter storm), that is not the case. Others claimed that this performance took place just before former U.S. President Donald Trump took the stage. That is also untrue. :According to CPAC's schedule, this rendition of the national anthem took place on the first day of CPAC 2021. Trump spoke on the final day of the conference. An unaltered version of Sabol's performance can be seen at the 20 minute mark of the following video:As you can see, this was an a capella version (sans piano accompaniment) of the national anthem. :Sabol's interpretation of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" struck a sour chord with some social media users, who shared video of her rendition with various jokes and criticism.One person, for instance, claimed that this song was in the ""key of Q"" (a reference to the Qanon conspiracy theory.) As the criticism circulated, some musicians started posting videos of themselves playing along with Sabol. The viral video shared above comes from pianist Larry Goldings.Here's a similar parody video from Kevon Carter::In short, a rendition of the national anthem performed at CPAC 2021 inspired some musicians to post mocking parodies.

151,151,201.WashingtonTimesRetra,"On 10 July 2016, Democratic National Committee (DNC) staffer Seth Rich was shot and killed just after 4 AM in Washington, D.C., in a case that remains open.  His death quickly became fodder for myriad unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, including that Rich was covertly working to expose election fraud, was collaborating with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on an unspecified investigation, was about to testify against Hillary Clinton in an unspecified case, and was the person who had supposedly provided WikiLeaks with thousands of leaked DNC email messages.In May 2017, Fox News retracted a report claiming that Rich had leaked thousands of DNC e-mails to the WikiLeaks website before he died.  In October 2018, the Washington Times followed suit and retracted elements of a March 2018 op-ed column on the same subject.In that (since-deleted) op-ed, the Washington Times stated as fact that ""data on [Seth Rich's] laptop revealed that Mr. Rich downloaded thousands of DNC emails and was in touch with Wikileaks,"" that Seth and his brother Aaron had ""downloaded the DNC emails and was paid by Wikileaks for that information,"" and that ""Joel and Mary Rich ... confirmed that their son transmitted the DNC emails to Wikileaks""::Data on [Seth Rich's] laptop revealed that Mr. Rich downloaded thousands of DNC emails and was in touch with Wikileaks. The file with evidence of what was on Mr. Rich's laptop sits with the FBI in a co-shared space with the D.C. police department. According to Ed Butowsky, an acquaintance of the family, in his discussions with Joel and Mary Rich, they confirmed that their son transmitted the DNC emails to Wikileaks.Since then, the DNC hired a ""spokesperson,"" Brad Burman, a known hatchet man to basically cut off any further communications with Mr. Rich's parents. Interestingly, it is well known in the intelligence circles that Seth Rich and his brother, Aaron Rich, downloaded the DNC emails and was paid by Wikileaks for that information.As to the last sentence quoted above, in their retraction the Washington Times noted that they now ""believe [it] to be false"" and do ""not have any basis to believe any part of that statement to be true"":The Washington Times published an op-ed column titled, ""More cover-up questions: The curious murder of Seth Rich poses questions that just won't stay under the official rug,"" by Adm. James Lyons (Ret.) (the ""Column""), on March 1 online and on March 2 in its paper editions. The Column included statements about Aaron Rich, the brother of former Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich, that we now believe to be false.One such statement was that: ""Interestingly, it is well known in the intelligence circles that Seth Rich and his brother, Aaron Rich, downloaded the DNC emails and was paid by Wikileaks for that information."" The Washington Times now does not have any basis to believe any part of that statement to be true, and The Washington Times retracts it in its entirety.The Column also stated: ""Also, why hasn't Aaron Rich been interviewed [by law enforcement], and where is he?"" The Washington Times understands that law enforcement officials have interviewed Mr. Rich and that he has cooperated with their investigation. The Washington Times did not intend to imply that Mr. Rich has obstructed justice in any way, and The Washington Times retracts and disavows any such implication.:CNN reported that Aaron Rich's attorney, Michael Gottlieb, said the retraction was part of a settlement Aaron Reached with The Washington Times after suing that news outlet for harm to his reputation and emotional distress caused by the suggestion he had played a role in the supposed DNC email theft:Police have said evidence indicates [Seth Rich] was the victim of a botched robbery, but in the wake of his death, far-right activists and media organizations suggested something far more sinister. Without real evidence, they peddled a conspiracy theory that said Seth Rich leaked a trove of DNC emails to Wikileaks and was killed in retribution for the supposed leak. The theory was convenient for some on the right as they disputed allegations Russia hacked the DNC, something President Trump had raised doubts about.Aaron Rich's lawsuit seeks damages for harm to his reputation and emotional distress, among other things, against ... The Washington Times for suggesting he played a role in the supposed email theft.The suit alleges those people and media companies pushed a conspiracy theory about Aaron Rich that used his background as a defense contractor with technical expertise to suggest he worked with his brother to leak DNC documents to Wikileaks, received money for doing so, and then worked to cover-up the crime.:"
152,152,697.Dida5GCellularNetwor,"Claim:The test of a 5G cellular network is the cause of unexplained bird deaths occurring in a park in The Hague, Netherlands. Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 5 November 2018, Erin Elizabeth's medical conspiracy blog Health Nut News ""reported"" a seemingly disturbing story out of the Netherlands with the headline ""Hundreds of birds dead during 5G experiment in The Hague, The Netherlands."" It turned out that Elizabeth's article was the wholesale regurgitation of a series of Facebook posts authored by a man named John Kuhles who runs several anti-5G conspiracy websites and social media pages.:Kuhles, who recently suggested that the devastating November 2018 California wildfires were triggered by a direct energy weapon as an act of revenge from the ""Ruling Elite"" to punish the state for vetoing a ""mass 5G deployment"" plan, tied the factual existence of unexplained bird deaths at a park (Huijgenspark) in The Hague, Netherlands, to a non-existent test of a next generation cell phone network (5G) that Kuhles claimed (without evidence) took place simultaneous with the bird deaths:About a week ago at The Hague, many birds died spontaneously, falling dead in a park. You likely haven't heard a lot about this because it seems keeping it quiet was the plan all along. However, when about 150 more suddenly died- bringing the death toll to 297- some started to take notice.And if you are looking around that park you might have seen what is on the corner of the roof across the street from where they died: a new 5G mast, where they had done a test, in connection with the Dutch railway station, to see how large the range was and whether no harmful equipment would occur on and around the station.And harm happened, indeed. Immediately afterward, birds fell dead from the trees. And the nearby ducks that were swimming seemed to react very oddly as well; they were simultaneously putting their heads underwater to escape the radiation while others flew away, landing on the street or in the canal. Again, almost at the exact same time that those animals died, near the station, Holland Spoor was tested with a 5G transmitter mast ... All the information that follows comes from John Kuhles' public Facebook page.:Did Hundreds of Birds Die in a Short Period of Time at Huijgenspark?It is true a series of mysterious bird deaths has occurred at a park in The Hague. According to the municipal government, the birds began to die on 19 October 2018, and soon afterwards those deaths inspired a dog ban in Huijgenspark as a precautionary measure:Between Friday, 19 October and Saturday, 3 November 2018, 337 dead starlings and 2 dead common wood pigeons were found. The municipality cannot rule out the possibility that the birds were poisoned. This is why the municipality has taken extra precautionary measures and announced a temporary ban on dogs for Huygenspark.Testing performed by the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority ruled out West Nile virus and the usutu virus, but it had not yet ruled out other viruses or poisoning as of 12 November 2018. A team of experts will continue to investigate the cause of these deaths::The municipality, together with De Wulp bird rescue, has asked experts in fauna research to look into this question. The cause of death for the birds is being investigated by Wageningen Bioveterinary Research (Lelystad), Dutch Wildlife Health Centre (Utrecht), Erasmus University (Rotterdam) and Universiteit Gent. Initial results are expected in mid-November 2018.Mysterious bird deaths, though great fodder for conspiracy cranks, are not uncommon. Due to their unexplained nature, they are popular with those seeking to stoke fears or make political or religious points. In 2011, for example, Arkansas, Louisiana, and parts of Sweden were the site of thousands of bird deaths in a short time, which the media dubbed ""the aflockalypse."" Contemporaneous reporting by the Associated Press made it clear that these mass die-offs are quite common and often unexplained:Since the 1970s, the U.S. Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center in Wisconsin has tracked mass deaths among birds, fish and other critters, said wildlife disease specialist LeAnn White. At times the sky and the streams just turn deadly. Sometimes it's disease, sometimes pollution. Other times it's just a mystery ... On average, 163 such events are reported to the federal government each year, according to USGS records.:Did a 5G Wireless Test Take Place Near Huijgenspark at the Time of the Bird Deaths?5G is the proposed 5th generation cellular network, and it is technology that is largely still in development. Various countries have tested forms of it, including The Netherlands, but its widespread adoption is not expected until 2020. We will discuss the technical aspects of 5G compared to existing cellular technology in the next section, but widespread access to this technology is a priority for the Dutch government, and they have performed tests of the technology a handful of times.One such test did occur in an area generally near Huijgenspark, but it took place on 28 June 2018, and it was not followed by a massive bird die-off. For this test, the Dutch equivalent of the FCC provided a one-day permit for the telecommunication company Huawei to use the 5G frequencies needed for the test::Huawei has demonstrated a live 5G network in The Hague, using 100 MHz of spectrum in the C-band at 3.5 GHz. As the frequencies are not normally available for mobile services in the Netherlands, the Telecom Agency granted a special one-day permit for the demonstration at the KPN office in the Voorburg area. The band is available for local licensing, but in allotments far smaller than the full 100 MHz width that is standardized for 5G.No evidence suggests that any other 5G test ever occurred in The Hague or that a 5G antenna was installed near that park conveniently out of view. We reached out via Twitter to the Dutch company NS, the operator of the train station allegedly involved in the 5G test, and a representative told us that they were ""unaware that recent 5G tests were conducted at this location."" A representative of KPN, the largest mobile operator in The Netherlands, told us via Twitter that ""I can be very clear about this matter; there are no 5G tests in Den Haag. This is a complete hoax."" Huawei, the cellular provider who took part in the one-day June test, did not respond to our inquiry about a test occurring, but the Dutch equivalent to the FCC asserted that no such test occurred.:It bears mentioning that Kuhles has since walked back his claim that a 5G test occurred at all (though this fact does not appear to have dissuaded Erin Elizabeth from running with her story), and he has now moved the goalposts so far as to claim that perhaps it was just a whole lot of 4G LTE networks getting up in those birds' business. Either way, from a scientific standpoint his ideas would generously be described as dubious.Could 5G Technology Have Caused Something Like This in the First Place?Promoters of 5G technology promise faster data rates along with reduced energy and financial cost. For the most part, these improvements will come from utilizing higher frequency radio bands and the development of more advanced cellular towers:Typically when a new mobile wireless technology comes along (like 5G), it's assigned a higher radio frequency ... The reason new wireless technologies occupy higher frequencies is because they typically aren't in use and move information at a much faster speed. The problem is that higher frequency signals don't travel as far as lower frequencies, so multiple input and output antennas (MIMOs) will probably be used to boost signals anywhere 5G is offered.:In Europe, 5G will make use of three frequency ranges: a low-frequency 700MHz ""coverage layer,"" a 3.4-3.8GHz band which will be the primary bandwidth, and a ""super data layer"" in the higher frequency 24.25-27.5GHz band. This latter range is more theoretical and is not what has been tested in The Netherlands thus far, as the only known test of 5G in the Hague utilized the 3.4-3.8GHz band. Regardless, all of these frequencies fall within a range considered by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (first in 1998 and again in 2009) to be safe:It is the opinion of ICNIRP that the scientific literature published since the 1998 guidelines has provided no evidence of any adverse effects below the basic restrictions and does not necessitate an immediate revision of its guidance on limiting exposure to high frequency electromagnetic fields ... The plausibility of the various non-thermal mechanisms that have been proposed is very low. In addition, the recent in vitro and animal genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies are rather consistent overall and indicate that such effects are unlikely at low levels of exposure. Therefore, ICNIRP reconfirms the 1998 basic restrictions in the frequency range 100 kHz-300 GHz until further notice.:Radio waves used in cellular technology can be described both by their frequency (or wavelength) and in terms of the energy being used to carry that frequency. The aforementioned restrictions refer to limits on the energy carrying a signal, which create exposure limits for various frequencies. Dr. Eric van Rongen, a member of the Health Council of the Netherlands and the Chairman of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, told us via email that the levels of exposure in the 5G frequency range are comparable to existing technology:The levels of exposure would be comparable to those of the current (3G and 4G) networks, and thus very low, much lower than the exposure limits. The only way one could imagine death of birds as a result of exposure to electromagnetic fields is with very high level exposure that results in considerable heating ... But the levels that are used by mobile telecom antennas are not strong enough for this to happen. There are maybe millions of such antennas around the world and this has never been reported.""Even if there would have been 5G exposure,"" he told us, it is ""very unlikely that that could cause the [bird] mortality."":""My 5G Conclusions Are Assertions/Conjecture with A QUESTION Mark!""One of the great benefits to being a conspiracy blogger, outside of the fact that copy and pasting a Facebook post counts as ""reporting"" and that objective reality need not be considered, is that you don't really need to follow up or correct yourself even when the person pushing a given conspiracy completely changes his tune. Erin Elizabeth's post, which has been shared well over 125,000 times on Facebook, included all of Khule's posts on the subject up to 2 November 2018.But on 8 November 2018, Kuhles posted again, appealing to his own authority while making sure everyone knew he wasn't really all that serious about that whole 5G thing in the first place. He brushed off factual criticism by calling his doubters sheeple and capitalizing certain words to make the letters LIE more prominent:Some think there is ""no 5G"" in Den Haag. That is a lie (or mis-perception) the so called ""conclusions"" of some (pseudo)-skeptics. Some ""Authorities"" claim a lot and is parroted by lesser authorities and beLIEved by the masses ... it is a system of beLIEfs, false assumptions copy catted ... That problem is with almost all controversial topics, nothing new ... most ppl just love to be told ""what is"" ... My 5G conclusions are assertions/conjecture with a QUESTION mark!:As compelling as this kind of testimony may be to Erin Elizabeth's Health Nut News, the facts are this: No 5G test occurred during the time that the mysterious starling deaths occurred, and the only person suggesting otherwise is someone with a vendetta against both objective reality and 5G wireless. Even if a 5G test had occurred, however, no mechanism exists that would explain how it could have affected starlings at all, let alone only starlings and no other birds or animals in the region."

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.Digital communications have spread conspiracy theories more widely than ever before, particularly in this uncertain and tumultuous year. QAnon, for example, is a movement that seeks to identify a ""deep state"" or ""global elite"" complicit in human trafficking, ""Pizzagate"" and the orchestration of a global pandemic. One conspiracy theory ""going viral""  is that extensive operations are taking place to rescue children held in secret underground locales beneath densely populated cities. Tunnel networks beneath major Australian cities such as Melbourne and Sydney have received similar treatment. Misconceptions of their form and purpose are communicated via social media. The stuff of urban legends, once circulated among acquaintances, is now online. :The misunderstandings of these spaces reveal a more glaring oversight: of wartime histories, transportation follies, essential services and the unique geologies and climates that require drainage infrastructure. These tunnels are hidden by necessity. But they are close enough to the surface to be easily accessible, preventing their use for any large-scale conspiracy.:A Facebook post linking the Melbourne COVID-19 lockdown to children held captive in underground tunnels.FacebookWhy the fixation with tunnels?Abandoned or atypical urban spaces have long piqued the public imagination. Sites of abandonment are also associated with notions of freedom and excitement. Urban exploration has increased significantly within the past decade, amplified by  social media sharing of imagery and aesthetics.  Rumours abound of complex tunnel networks in major Australian cities, created in the wake of the second world war. Larger air raid shelters were often located close to urban settlement, but escaped use. They remained in public memory as mythology: bunkers can be located across Australia, from Dover Heights in Sydney, to Prospect and Glenelg in Adelaide. Over 20 air raid shelters exist in Brisbane alone. The entrances to an air raid shelter at Howard Smith Wharves, Brisbane.Kgbo/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA:The fabled ""Northcote Tunnel"" in Melbourne was the subject of decades of rumour. It was eventually found to be the result of a search for an underground stream, not the large-scale 1940s American construction it was said to be. Tunnels beneath Sydney served similar purposes, either by design or as the result of a failed transport infrastructure project. The St James tunnels are a prime example. This ""hidden"" space is about to be converted to a tourism precinct. Beneath the streets of Melbourne, Sydney and beyond, mail and precious cargo were often transported about the city in underground tunnels from nearby railway stations or ports to parliament or the General Post Office. So what are these spaces used for today?Today, urban tunnels carry telecommunications, gas, electricity, water and sewerage infrastructure.:Exact locations remain secret for security and operational reasons. Access is allowed in rare cases. In the case of the Royal Melbourne Hospital steam tunnels, members of the public can book a place on once-yearly tours. :Partially constructed tunnels and unused platforms at St James railway station, Sydney.Beau Giles/Wikimedia Commons, CC BYStormwater drains are most abundant in urban areas; perhaps this is why they feature so heavily in conspiracies. Where depressions, undulations or linear tracts of open space exist in the landscape, a stormwater drain is likely lurking beneath the surface. These drains are needed to divert rainwater from areas where hard surfaces would otherwise lead to flooding. In Melbourne, the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works started building these drains in the early 20th century. I have explored many of these complex networks, over 1,400 kilometres of drains that span almost all of metropolitan Melbourne and its fringes. These drains are literally beneath the feet of city dwellers: many would be surprised to find that a drain runs beneath the major thoroughfare of Elizabeth Street, historically Williams Creek. :The Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board built similar infrastructure in Sydney. Open and closed conduits were built in concrete and brick -- as well as bluestone in Melbourne, and limestone in Sydney -- throughout the past century. Sydney's stormwater network totals 454 kilometres of drains and spans 73 water catchments. These drains ultimately carry 500 billion litres into Sydney Harbour or Botany Bay. A tidal drain at South Yarra, Melbourne, in 2008. The installation of litter-trapping equipment now prevents access.Photo: Victoria KolankiewiczDangerous, yes, but for more mundane reasonsThese hidden spaces can be controversial or dangerous, but not for the reasons put forth by QAnon and its ilk. Social groups have emerged around drain exploration, with the Melbourne-based Cave Clan the best-known example. They have clear rules to ensure the safety of their members. ""No drains when it rains"" is one such rule: sudden rain can catch out explorers as water levels rise quickly inside drains. :Drownings have been reported in both Sydney and Melbourne. The unpredictability of sudden torrential flows means these spaces are fundamentally unsuited to the purposes suggested in conspiracy theories.Frequent visits by urban explorers would also quickly identify any secretive mis-uses of drainage infrastructure. This would equally apply to other underground spaces such as steam and service tunnels - maintenance staff would soon spot anything amiss.More crucial, however, is that the design of these drains means they could not play any part in supposed trafficking networks. Some of these drains are large enough for adults to explore. The vast majority, though, are too small to be accessed, with diameters as narrow as 300mm. Even the most cavernous drains would not be suitable for storage. Larger drains are designed to hold larger flows, often at a confluence of catchment areas. While they these drains could host human beings, they would be at risk of drowning whenever it rained. Tidal flows or litter traps can also prevent access.:Child trafficking is a very relevant issue, but it is certainly not taking place under cities across the nation. Rather than abandoning subterranean spaces to conspiratorial narratives or urban mythology, these spaces are important for other reasons. These point to the need to build a common understanding not only of their form and function, but also of the ethos underlying their existence, a concern for the common good. That something as impressive and as everyday as our civic infrastructure inspires such fascination and fear is indeed curious.

Rating:FalseAbout this rating OriginOn March 17, 2020, as much of the world was occupied with concerns about the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, a bizarre theory started to circulate on social media involving TV host Oprah Winfrey and accusations of pedophilia.:This rumor was largely driven by a series of images that supposedly showed Winfrey's house after it had been seized by authorities.:Winfrey's home was not raided. The television star was not arrested for sex trafficking and her home was not seized. A few hours after this rumor went viral, she took to Twitter to inform her fans that this was an ""awful FAKE"" rumor and that it was ""NOT TRUE."" That should be enough to debunk this rumor. But let's take a look at the ""evidence"" anyway. The first thing we noticed when looking at photographs supposedly showing the police raid at her house was that they didn't show her or any police. Rather, these pictures appear to show some road-construction signs. :The rumor about her home being raided during a sex-trafficking sting is part of a larger conspiracy theory pushed by the ""Qanon"" or ""Q"" community. While this theory is complex and often nonsensical, it can basically be boiled down to the following sentence: A global community of high-profile celebrities and politicians (aka ""the deep state"") exists that, when not performing satanic rituals and running a child sex-trafficking ring, tries to undermine U.S. President Donald Trump.Craig Silverman, media editor at Buzzfeed, made this short video explaining the conspiracy theory::A long piece of text was also circulated on social media that attempted to connect the dots between a series of false claims. It begins with ""This morning at 4:30 a.m., Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was served [...]."" Winfrey is named in the third paragraph of this text in which the author speculates about future arrests. We won't dive too deep into this text post. The general claim is that COVID-19 is fake and is being used to cover up mass arrests of celebrities and politicians for pedophilia. This is an outrageous and dangerous claim. The coronavirus is real, it has caused thousands of deaths around the globe, and it continues to spread at a rapid pace. :This post also claims that coronavirus is also being used for a ""mass mandatory vaccination"" program. This is an unfounded, dangerous, and ridiculous claim, especially when you consider the fact that testing for the disease is still drastically low. If you were going to create a fake disease to trick people into taking vaccinations, wouldn't you have these ""mandatory vaccinations"" ready when you released your fake bioweapon? To sum up: Winfrey was not arrested and her home was not raided as part of a sex-trafficking sting. This rumor is an offshoot of a larger conspiracy theory that posits the coronavirus is being used to implement a ""mandatory vaccination program"" and cover up the arrests of celebrities such as Winfrey, Tom Hanks, and Ellen DeGeneres for their involvement in the ""deep state's"" global sex-trafficking operation. In a word, this rumor is ""False."" "
155,155,597.PostsAboutDieselExha,"In May 2022, we began receiving inquiries about a Facebook post that had been copied and pasted by a seemingly countless number of users, claiming that the Union Pacific railroad company was placing an ""embargo"" on Pilot Flying J. Pilot Flying J operates travel centers (better known as truck stops) around the U.S. The purported embargo by Union Pacific would supposedly cause a shortage of an important product called diesel exhaust fluid (DEF), as Pilot Flying J utilizes the railroad company's shipping services to deliver DEF to truckers. The post said the embargo would lead to fewer trucks on the road, resulting in nationwide food shortages. All of this was misleading.For years, Facebook users have been copying and pasting posts that make bold and oftentimes spooky claims. We call these copypasta. They're similar to the email chains of old that would also promote serious-sounding yet questionable information that, if forwarded to all of one's friends, might make the sender feel a bit like a hero. As common as they are, few of these kinds of posts have been as misleading and complex as the one we're about to dive into.Quick Summary:If you're short on time, here's what you should know. The primary claim made in the viral Facebook post was that Union Pacific was placing an embargo on Pilot Flying J. That supposed embargo would drastically reduce the number of rail cars that Pilot Flying J could use to ship diesel exhaust fluid for its truck stops. DEF is needed for a lot of diesel trucks to operate. A shortage of DEF for the trucking industry would theoretically result in fewer trucks on the road, meaning there might be shortages of food and other goods in the future, the post claimed. However, both Union Pacific and Pilot Flying J provided information to us that showed the rumors were misleading. We have included the companies' statements at the end of this article.A Complete Breakdown of the PostIn an effort to provide the truth behind each claim in the post, we have broken it down into several parts below. All of the sources we consulted are displayed at the end of the article.:The Facebook post began as follows:Pay attention, please. Do you know what DEF fluid is? It's diesel exhaust fluid. Every diesel truck that has been made since 2010 is required to use it. It's a product made of 67% urea fertilizer and 33% distilled water. Every diesel truck you see driving down the road today has to have this product to drive. The engines won't start without it. There are regulators inside the engine that mix DEF with the diesel to reduce diesel emissions. That's the purpose of DEF.In our research, we found most of this to be true. (Note, however, that DEF consists of 32.5% urea and 67.5% deionized water, not the other way around.) The simplest way to describe the purpose of diesel exhaust fluid is that it helps to convert engine exhaust into clean, harmless, and natural elements. DEF is required for today's large diesel trucks. (DEF isn't mixed with diesel fuel. According to what we found, DEF is injected into the exhaust.)According to Cummins, a company that manufactures engines and provides a number of other auto solutions, ""almost all diesel-powered passenger cars and trucks built since 2010 are equipped with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and require diesel exhaust fluid (DEF)."":The ingredients and percentages mentioned in the post were correct, as was the fact that modern diesel engines need DEF to start up. The post continued:Right now, Russia is the largest exporter of urea by a wide margin. Qatar is second. Egypt and China are tied for 3rd. Both Russia and China have decided to no longer export urea. On top of that, India is the largest manufacturer of urea in the world even though they consume most of what they make. What little they would export..........they no longer do. They are now stopping the exportation of any and all urea minus a deal they just cut with Sri Lanka.As of 2019 (the most recent information available), this data about the countries' rankings for exports of urea fertilizer was correct. It's unclear if Egypt and China were ""tied"" as the Facebook post mentioned, but their numbers from 2019 were quite similar.Russia did ""temporarily"" halt urea exports in early 2022. It's also true that, in 2021, China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) ""ordered major Chinese fertilizer companies to stop exporting [urea] 'to ensure the supply of the domestic chemical fertilizer market.'"":Additionally, the urea production facts about India and Sri Lanka were true.The next part of the post made a false claim about urea production in the U.S.:What does this mean for you and me? Well, first, the United States imports most of its urea fertilizer. We are the third largest importer in the entire world. We depend on other countries to eat, drive, and ship our products.This was misleading. According to numbers from 2019 that were published by the data platform Knoema (the most recent information available), the U.S. produced more urea that year than it imported. However, yes, the U.S. was the third on the list of countries for imported quantities of urea. (In December 2021, The New York Times published an article describing more details about the worldwide impact of the lack of availability of urea fertilizer.)The next paragraph in the Facebook post described the aforementioned primary claim about Union Pacific and Pilot Flying J::Secondly... Flying J is the largest service provider for truckers around the United States. I'm sure you've seen their massive gas stations when traveling around the country. Flying J gets 70% of their DEF fluid from shipments via Union Pacific railroad. UP has single user access to the fertilizer plants that urea/DEF fluid comes from. No other rail provider has access to these distribution points. This means Flying J can't just go around Union Pacific. Union Pacific is in charge....for a reason I'm gonna mention in a few paragraphs.Pilot Flying J truly did appear to be ""the largest travel center operator in North America.""As for the other points made in this part of the Facebook post, we'll turn to an April 2022 hearing conducted by the Surface Transportation Board (STB). This hearing played a key role in the creation of the misleading post. The board's website described its purpose as ""an independent federal agency that is charged with the economic regulation of various modes of surface transportation, primarily freight rail."":The hearing was titled as, ""STB Hearing on Urgent Issues in Freight Rail Service."" Pilot Flying J CEO Shameek Konar spoke to the board. He said that about 70 percent of Pilot Flying J locations receive DEF from shipments on the Union Pacific railroad. Konar also provided answers that reflected some of the same information seen in the post.The post went on (""UP"" refers to Union Pacific):Flying J provides 30% of all DEF consumed in the United States. UP has told Flying J to reduce their shipments by a whopping 50%. And if they do not comply then they will be completely embargoed. That would in effect bankrupt FJ. This means that 15% of all DEF consumed by truckers in the US is no longer available at the largest travel service center for the entire trucking industry.During the April 2022 hearing with the STB, Konar made statements that echoed all of these statistics. However, in June 2022, after we contacted both Union Pacific and Pilot Company, the owner of Flying J brand, both companies put to rest the rumor that any such reduction in DEF shipments had occurred.:Also, we did not find that Konar ever said the aforementioned embargo from Union Pacific would ""bankrupt"" Pilot Flying J, but he did mention that ""the current situation is untenable"" for the company. He also said, apparently partly as a joke, that he would be ""fired"" if the embargo went into effect.At this point, the Facebook post veered into conspiracy theory territory:Rome rotted from the inside out. It was easily invaded because it was occupied with internal problems. It appears we have discovered the trigger. DEF fluid. If this holds up, DEF shortages will be the catalyst that causes food shortages in the coming months. Not only is there a shortage of fertilizer to grow crops in drought-stricken states (see Kansas' drop in wheat production for 2022)....but....now it looks like, unless the federal government intervenes via the Defense Production Act, ...which I am no longer confident they will....there's gonna be an absolute massive shortage of trucking in the coming months.Aside from the claim about Rome, the rest of this part of the Facebook post appeared to consist of unsupported predictions about the future. (The mention of Kansas led us to an article from KCUR.org that cited a farmer who said the state's wheat production was down due to drought and the high cost of fertilizer and fuel.):The post was almost done at this point (we hoped):There simply isn't going to be DEF fluid sufficient to keep the engines running and moving. Home Depot is now limiting the amount of DEF you can buy in their stores.The first part of this claim was false, as Union Pacific and Pilot Flying J confirmed to us that no embargo ever went into effect, meaning there was no shortage of DEF being shipped by Union Pacific to Pilot Flying J travel centers.As for the claim about Home Depot, we contacted the company's media inquiries team to find out if stores really were ""limiting the amount of DEF"" that could be purchased. By email, a spokesperson for Home Depot told us that they found an issue that caused purchases to be limited to only six units of DEF at a time for online orders. However, they said the error was in the process of being fixed and that there was never a limit on how many quantities could be bought in-store.The post continued with its warnings::I would think long and hard about the decisions you are making right now. Where you live. What you spend money on. How you prepare. This is so real that the CEO of Flying J, Shameek Konar was summoned to a Surface Transportation Board hearing to give them all this info.From what I'm reading....BlackRock is the majority shareholder of Union Pacific railroad. How is that important? America's biggest fertilizer producer is CF Industries. Their largest shareholder is BlackRock. BlackRock controls the fertilizer industry in the U.S. Union Pacific has exclusive rights to distribution points of fertilizer. Urea is fertilizer. Flying J needs urea/DEF. BlackRock is controlling everything.Here are some facts. As of May 9, 2022, the majority shareholder of Union Pacific was The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.5 percent of the shares. BlackRock, Inc. was described as ""the second largest shareholder owning 7.3 percent of common stock.""According to CompaniesMarketCap.com, CF Industries was the second largest fertilizer company in the U.S. Further, BlackRock was not CF Industries' largest shareholder.:Konar did mention that Union Pacific had some exclusive rights, but we'll move on instead of getting into the weeds of that claim:The chairman of the BlackRock Investment Institute is Tom Donilon, President Obama's former National Security Advisor. Tom Donilon's brother, Mike Donilon is a Senior Advisor to Joe Biden. Tom Donilon's wife, Catherine Russell, is the White House personnel director. Tom Donilon's daughter, Sarah Donilon, who graduated college in 2019, now works on the White House National Security Council.All of these statements in the post about the administrations of former U.S. President Barack Obama and U.S. President Joe Biden were true. However, they were also completely irrelevant. As we already established, we received word from both Union Pacific and Pilot Company that effectively debunked the primary concern mentioned in the copypasta post, namely a supposed shortage of DEF.It appears BlackRock is spearheading the dismantling of the U.S. system on behalf of the globalists. And the first domino they are pushing over is the energy sector. They are using DEF to get the party started.  This is one sector of the biggest downfalls in political repercussions this country has ever faced...??Copied and pasted!!Not good. People better start paying attention. Get these people out of office.:This last part of the viral post consisted of nothing more than unsupported conspiracy theories about BlackRock.Company StatementsOn June 20, a spokesperson for Pilot Company provided details about its shipping status with Union Pacific. The statement effectively cleared up any looming concerns over the possibility of a DEF shortage:We can confirm that there is no embargo in place by Union Pacific at this time. We can also confirm that Pilot Company is not currently experiencing any shortages in our supply of diesel exhaust fuel (DEF). Shameek Konar offered this testimony to the Surface Transportation Board on April 27, 2022 - referring specifically to diesel exhaust fluid. Since that date, Pilot Company has had productive conversations with Union Pacific and is able to continue to utilize their rail services to supply our customers and guests. We look forward to maintaining this relationship to ensure that America's over-the-road commercial trucking remains strong.:Also on June 20, a spokesperson for Union Pacific told us that the initial request to reduce shipments by rail car was strictly voluntary. Just like Pilot Company's statement, this information from Union Pacific called into question the idea that the U.S. would see a DEF shortage:Union Pacific has not issued any formal embargoes related to inventory reduction efforts on our network. We asked customers to voluntarily reduce their own inventories and we continue to work with our customers to alleviate congestion on the network.On April 11, we sent out this announcement to our customers, raising the possibility of ""metering"" traffic on our network. This would be akin to limiting the cars on a freeway to improve congestion, rather than allowing them all on the freeway, where they will slow down the overall traffic, jamming up on the freeway.However, we have not implemented an embargo that mandated shippers reduce their private car fleets.On May 6, we sent out an announcement that said we were making progress.We continue to collaborate with our customers and report our progress regularly as we work to improve service.:In sum, there's no evidence at this time that there will be trucking and food shortages as a result of any actions related to Union Pacific and Pilot Flying J, or a shortage of DEF.Copypasta posts on Facebook rarely contain sources.

156,156,492.DidtheObamaTransitio,"Claim:The Obama transition team kept a list of Muslims for top jobs.Rating:MixtureAbout this rating What's TrueThe transition team for the newly elected Obama administration in 2008 did compile a list of potential Muslim and Asian-American candidates for cabinet posts.What's FalseThe story about the list was published in 2016 and lacked both timely relevance and context as it recirculated for unknown reasons in 2019.:In mid-April 2019, a dated story from the Daily Caller website began circulating on social media for unclear reasons. The story, originally published on 24 October 2016, bore the headline, ""LEAKED: Obama Team Kept List of Muslims For Top Jobs, Excluded Non-Muslims.""The story is based on the contents of a stolen email leaked by document-dumping platform WikiLeaks. It was part of a now-infamous trove of Democratic National Committee (DNC) messages that were hacked and spilled online in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election. The Daily Caller in 2016 reported:The newest batch of John Podesta's hacked emails released by Wikileaks shows Obama's transition team kept lists of Muslim and Asian candidates for jobs in the administration.According to an email chain from 2008, John Podesta received lists of exclusively Muslims and Asians to be considered for jobs in the Obama administration. The email chain revealed that in this process, Middle Eastern Christians were purposefully excluded, or set aside in a separate list, with an aide writing,""In the candidates for top jobs, I excluded those with some Arab American background but who are not Muslim (e.g., George Mitchell). Many Lebanese Americans, for example, are Christian. In the last list (of outside boards/commissions), most who are listed appear to be Muslim American, except that a handful (where noted) may be Arab American but of uncertain religion (esp. Christian)."":It is both true and unsurprising that per the leaked email, dated 17 October 2008, non-Muslims were excluded from a list of potential Muslim candidates to be considered for Obama administration posts. What the Daily Caller story failed to elucidate is whether lists of candidates from other demographic groups were compiled to promote general diversity in the Obama administration's ranks. Because agency heads during Obama's presidency came from various backgrounds, it's safe to say non-Muslims were not ""excluded"" from consideration for top posts.Many took to social media in spring of 2019 to suggest that the information was both new, and that the effort to hire Muslim people to administration cabinet positions was somehow nefarious.:As noted earlier, the story is not new and lacks key context.It was published roughly two weeks before the November 2016 election and was itself based on a document that at the time was eight years old. The email was forwarded to Podesta, who at the time served as co-chair of President-elect Obama's transition team, from Gayle Smith, who worked in the White House under both Obama and President Bill Clinton. The forwarded message included commentary on a list of potential candidates compiled by attorney and former Obama administration official Preeta Bansal to be considered for ""top Administration jobs, sub-cabinet jobs, and outside boards/agencies/policy committees."" The desire for a cabinet that contains demographic representation reflecting the American populace isn't unique to the Obama administration. In 2000, NBC News reported on similar aspirations by Obama's predecessor, then-President-elect George W. Bush. ""People that work hard and make the right decisions in life can achieve anything they want in America,"" Bush is quoted as saying at the time.:Bush went on to select Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice to serve as consecutive Secretaries of State. They were the first African-American man and woman to hold that high-ranking post.The old Daily Caller story about the WikiLeaks document may have gained sudden online momentum because the organization's founder, Julian Assange, has been in the news. He was arrested in London on 11 April 2019 and faces extradition to the U.S. on charges that he conspired to hack a Pentagon computer in 2010. Assange, who initially faced extradition to Sweden where he was accused of sexual assault, has been holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in Britain for seven years to avoid arrest, long fearing extradition to the United States.But the Ecuadorian government, citing a string of alleged grievances from discourteous behavior to using its property for international espionage, evicted Assange and suspended the citizenship it bestowed upon him, making his arrest possible and bringing the long saga to an end.WikiLeaks played a key role in the morass of disinformation that flooded cyberspace in the 2016 election cycle, both pumping out troves of emails stolen from the DNC by Russian hackers and fanning the flames of a false conspiracy theory that alleged murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich, not Russian operatives, hacked the DNC.:Because WikiLeaks activities vis-a-vis the election harmed the efforts of President Donald Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton, Trump and some of his supporters professed their support for the organization. After Assange's arrest, however, some prominent supporters, including Trump, have backed away, with the president stating, ""I know nothing about WikiLeaks. It's not my thing ... It's not my deal in life."""
157,157,644.DoesBillGatesOwntheM,"Claim:Former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates owns a majority of America's farmland. Rating:FalseAbout this rating ContextIn April 2022, conspiracy theorists insinuated that billionaire Bill Gates was buying up ""the majority"" of American farmland as part of a diabolical  plot to cause widespread food shortages.:Fact CheckIn April 2022, researchers warned about the potential risk of a global food shortage, spurred on in part by Russia's ongoing attacks on Ukraine. While there are currently no nationwide food shortages in the United States, nor widespread disruptions in the supply chain, the potential of such shortages caused many people to feel that their food security was suddenly uncertain. In the wake of this uncertainty, unfounded rumors began to spread that attempted to lay the blame for any coming food shortages on nefarious forces. One such rumor claimed that there had been an unusual number of fires at food processing facilities in 2022. The explanation offered by conspiracy theorists for this untrue claim was that these fires were being intentionally set in order to create a food crisis. In reality, the number of fires was not extraordinary, the causes of the fires were not unusual, and the damage caused by the fires was minimal. As unfounded rumors related to the cause of a yet-to-happen food crisis circulated online, many people started to point fingers at a favorite target of conspiracy theorists, former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates. :Does Bill Gates Own the Majority of U.S. Farmland?One of the most prevalent claims related to Gates and the potential for food shortages is that the billionaire owns a suspicious amount of farmland in the United States. On social media, we found people claiming, for example, that Gates owns the ""majority"" of U.S. farmland -- 80%, they claimed -- and that Gates is trying to buy up ""all"" of the farmland. :These claims are not true. Gates does not own anywhere close to the majority of America's farmland. How Much Farmland Does Gates Own?Gates does own a lot of farmland. In fact, he reportedly owns more farmland than any other individual in America. According to 2021 article from the Land Report, a magazine about land ownership, Gates owns approximately 242,000 acres of farmland. While this is certainly a lot of acreage, it represents less than 1% of all the farmland in the United States. According to a 2021 report from the United States Department of Agriculture and the National Agriculture Statistics Service, there are 895,300,000 acres of farmland in the United States. Gates' 242,000 acres amounts to about 0.03% of the total. To put that into perspective, if you put all of the land that Gates owns into one place (his holdings are spread throughout the country), you'd cover an area about a quarter the size of Rhode Island. :Why Does Gates Own So Much Farmland?While viral conspiracy theories baselessly conjecture that Gates is buying up farmland in order to starve Americans for some unknown reason, there's likely a simpler explanation: Gates makes money off this land. Gates started purchasing farmland circa 2013 through his investment group, Cascade Investments. Agfundernews.com, a website about agricultural investments, reported in 2021 that Gates' investments were part of a broader trend that started after the financial crisis of 2008, as investors looked for reliable returns. For many years, farmland was not a common asset class among financial investors ... The tide began to shift in the early 2000s, when institutional investors began to give farmland a closer look. Momentum accelerated during the 2008-2009 Great Financial Crisis, when investors grew desperate for alternatives to traditional safe haven investments like bonds and gold. In this short period of time, there was a proliferation in funds that were specifically focused on farmland investing. In 2020, there were 166 such funds globally, nearly a 9x increase from only 19 in 2005.[...]Bill Gates' investments in farmland can be seen as part of this trend. The Gates' have been quietly acquiring farmland through their investment manager, Cascade Investment, for over 10 years.:While many have also speculated that Gates' land purchases were in some way related to his efforts to curb climate change, Gates has said that the two are unrelated. Gates said during a Reddit AMA:My investment group chose to do this. It is not connected to climate. The agriculture sector is important. With more productive seeds we can avoid deforestation and help Africa deal with the climate difficulty they already face. It is unclear how cheap biofuels can be but if they are cheap it can solve the aviation and truck emissions.Bill Gates and Conspiracy Theories:During times of uncertainty, people often look for someone to blame, and peddlers of misinformation are quick to tell others at whom they should be pointing their fingers. Oftentimes, those fingers get pointed at Gates.During the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine-hesitant Americans were inundated with false rumors claiming that Gates was putting microchips into vaccines, that he was working on a mind-altering vaccine, that Gates had input tracking devices into vaccines, and that he once called for vaccinations as a way to depopulate the planet. These rumors, like the present rumor about Gates buying up the majority of farmland in the United States for nefarious purposes, are all false. "
158,158,406.IsObamaClaimingKenya,"Claim:Former U.S. President Barack Obama is about to claim Kenyan citizenship to avoid being tried for treason by the U.S.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On July 29, 2019, an obscure website called End of the Age Headlines published an article headlined ""Obama Will Claim Kenyan Citizenship to Keep from Being Tried for Treason.""That article read (in its entirety) as follows::LLEGAL COMMANDER IN CHIEF: Barack Obama will soon admit to having been born in Kenya, in an attempt to avoid being prosecuted for treason. It's already been proven that his birth certificate is a phony. Q has even said that he will claim Kenyan citizenship to keep from being charged for treason. Now, if he claims Kenyan citizenship, that means he was a false president, in which case every decision this man has made is now null and void, including the two Supreme Court justices!Everything stated in that brief article was incorrect:Obama's birth certificate has not been proved ""phony."" In fact, it has been verified by the original issuing authority, the Hawaii Department of Health, and that certificate -- along with considerable other evidence -- documents that Barack Obama was born in Hawaii and thus is a native-born citizen of the U.S.Even if Barack Obama were not a native-born citizen of the U.S., and thus was ineligible to hold the office of president of the U.S., no provision in U.S. law exists for retroactively invalidating the actions of a president who improperly attained office.:No credible information supports the notion that Obama undertook any particular actions for which he is about to be, or even could be, ""tried for treason."" Article 3, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution very narrowly defines the crime of treason: ""Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort."" As University of California Davis law Professor Carlton F.W. Larson noted in an article on the subject, under that definition, ""Speaking against the government, undermining political opponents, supporting harmful policies or even placing the interests of another nation ahead of those of the United States are not acts of treason under the Constitution.""Even if Obama were (about) to be tried for treason and had in fact been born in Kenya (neither of which appears remotely true), his simply claiming Kenyan citizenship at this juncture would not necessarily protect him from the consequences. As Larson noted, the notion that only U.S. citizens can commit treason against the U.S. is a myth: ""[T]he offense of treason can be committed by any person who owes allegiance to the United States, and this can include noncitizens. Treason law recognizes two kinds of allegiance: permanent and temporary. U.S. citizens owe permanent allegiance to the United States, and this duty carries with them wherever they go in the world. By contrast, noncitizens in the United States (other than ambassadors and their staffs) owe a duty of temporary allegiance, the Supreme Court found in an 1872 case. While they are within the United States and receiving protection from it, noncitizens are governed by American treason law. If a person on a green card or a student or tourist visa, for example, wages war against the United States or provides aid and comfort to our enemies, he cannot escape a treason prosecution simply by asserting his foreign citizenship."":In fact, the End of the Age Headlines article was cribbed from a piece published by the Right Wing Watch website, which revealed that the ""Obama Will Claim Kenyan Citizenship to Keep from Being Tried for Treason"" rumor was based on nothing more than wild and unsupported speculation delivered in a YouTube video by a ""radical right-wing conspiracy theorist"":During his recent appearance on Tiffany FitzHenry's YouTube program, radical right-wing conspiracy theorist and so-called ""firefighter prophet"" Mark Taylor claimed that Barack Obama will soon admit to having been born in Kenya in an attempt to avoid being prosecuted for treason.""I don't think the guy is American,"" Taylor said. ""It's already been proven that that birth certificate is a phony.""Taylor insisted that the issue of Obama's birth certificate is vitally important because it is the key to effectively negating his entire presidency, citing the QAnon conspiracy theory which claims that high-ranking intelligence officials in the Trump administration are leaking information about a secret plan to take down a global network of satanic pedophiles that includes prominent Democratic Party entertainment, political and business figures.:"

The rumor is based on the suspension of @RudolphGiuliani, a Twitter account that frequently posted about #Pizzagate, a baseless (but complicated) conspiracy theory about a massive pedophilia ring was being run out a Washington, D.C. pizzeria.:Shortly before this account was suspended on 20 December 2016, it published an image purporting to be an ""official statement"" from Giuliani about the conspiracy theory::I know time is short. I will not waste words. You have seen my comments on the so-called ""PizzaGate"" scandal. I can tell you that yes, it is completely true. This is common knowledge among those in power. The pedophile ring in Washington D.C. is the biggest in the world, with London's probably coming in second.While I have never participated in these heinous acts, I know people who have and I know many who escaped prosecution. Time is to short to explain why I have remained silent for so long, but I will say that I would have never become Mayor of New York City if I did not ""play ball,"" as it were.While it is true that the @RudolphGiuliani account was suspended by Twitter on 20 December 2016 after posting several messages about Pizzagate, this account was not affiliated with the former mayor of New York.  The @RudolphGiuliani account was not verified, and this statement was not posted via any official channels. Giuliani also doesn't have an official Twitter account.In November 2016, another Giuliani parody (@rudygiulianiGOP) made the news when NBC's Chuck Todd questioned the former Mayor about a fake tweet. Guiliani said that he was aware of at least four accounts that post hoax content in his name::""I didn't tweet that. That's not my tweet. I never said that. That's somebody pretending to be me.

160,160,308.DidMarjorieTaylorGre,"Claim:On March 2, 2021, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called the practice of going through metal detectors in the U.S. House a form of voter suppression.Rating:Correct AttributionAbout this rating On March 3, 2021, conservative media outlet The Washington Times reported that U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said new metal detectors designed to keep lawmakers safe following the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection were a form of voter suppression. ::First, some context: Capitol maintenance crews installed the machines to screen people entering House chambers after the deadly insurrection. Since then, most House members used the metal detectors regularly without questions, The Associated Press reported. But some Republicans initially sidestepped the devices or refused to be checked with wands after they set them off. ""Capitol Police have now placed desks and velvet ropes near the metal detectors to block anyone from walking around the machines,"" the AP reported on Jan. 22.Now, let us address the claim that Greene, a far-right conspiratorialist, compared the safety measure to nefarious schemes by partisan groups to prevent people from voting in U.S. elections.According to CSPAN's video recording of congressional proceedings on March 2, the representative indeed said the practice of standing in ""long lines to enter the chamber"" to use the metal detectors was ""real voter suppression"" in her opinion. She made the statement during a debate over legislation to change campaign-finance and voting laws on (read bill H.R. 1 here).:Here's Greene's full quote, according to the video footage:I rise in opposition to H.R. 1. While we are talking about voter suppression and long lines, there is real voter suppression that happens right here in Congress. Many members of Congress have to stand in long lines to enter the chamber going through metal detectors, emptying our pockets, and being treated very disrespectfully. So that is real suppression, and it's a shame it happens right here on the House floor.Standing in line to vote is not voter suppression -- it's just part of the voting process, just like people stand in line to buy groceries at the grocery store. Voters in a northwestern region of Georgia in November 2020 elected Greene to represent them, and she began her term in Washington, D.C., in January 2021.During her campaign and afterwards, she embraced the QAnon conspiracy theory and advocated on the frontlines of former President Donald Trump's misinformation campaign to try to convince voters that Joe Biden won the presidency using illegal methods.

This, according to proponents of this claim, showed that the coronavirus pandemic was nothing more than a conspiracy theory. :In all honesty, we had trouble following the logic of this false rumor.Those spreading these ""mind blowing"" search results also appeared a little unsure of what it meant. Most of the posts we encountered did not lay out any specific claims or accusations. Rather, these messages contained vague statements about how the world was being ""played."" As best we can tell, the idea is that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (or, possibly, some shadowy group of elites, George Soros, or another frequently invoked boogeyman) were gaming search results in order to inundate the population with coronavirus content and convince everyone that this ""hoax"" was in fact a real problem. There are, of course, a number of problems with this theory. Does Googling Any Three-Digit Number Followed by 'New Cases' Return Coronavirus-Related Articles?Mostly true. We have not typed each of the 900 three-digit numbers (100-999) into Google followed by ""new cases,"" but we did perform a few dozen searches in this manner and in every instance we did get results related to rising COVID-19 cases. For some numbers (typically on the higher range of the three-digit set), Google had to dig back weeks or months in order to find news articles related to the specific search term. :Is Anything Odd or Unusual About These Search Results?Not really. Although some may see (or claim to see) these search results as ""mind blowing,"" this actually isn't all that unusual considering the duration (approximately 8 months, as of this writing) and widespread impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.Consider this: The first case of COVID-19 in the United States was reported in January 2020. Since then, the disease has spread to all 50 states. In the approximately 200 days between the early COVID-19 cases and this writing, state, local, territorial, academic, and commercial entities have reported case numbers to the CDC. Many cities have also held daily press briefings. In addition to multiple entities recording and reporting on these numbers, there have also been national and local news outlets publishing articles on a daily basis about this data. Let's take a look at the math. If each of the 50 states issued daily reports about COVID-19 cases for 200 days, that would mean 10,000 reports could contain a three-digit number of COVID-19 cases. There are approximately 19,500 municipal governments in the United States. If every one of those governments reported a daily rise in cases over this 200 days, that's an additional 3,900,000 reports that could contain a three-digit number of COVID-19 cases. If you factor in local and national newspapers and websites (we'll use 13,000, the number of daily newspapers in circulation in 2014; the actual number is likely much higher due to an unknown number of online news websites), that's an additional 2,600,000 reports about COVID-19. :Even if you reduced the number of possible days from 200 to 120 (lockdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic started in March 2020), that's still millions of daily reports that could possibly show a three-digit rise in case numbers.It should also be noted that Google can return search results from international organizations, cities, and news outlets. In other words, there are millions of articles and reports that Google can comb through in order to find a result for each of the 900 possible three-digit numbers.Are These News Reports Manufactured, Doctored, or Inaccurate?Herein lies an even bigger hole in the conspiracy theory. Out of the dozens of social media posts we encountered from people spreading this rumor, we have not seen anyone correctly claim that the search results provided by Google were inaccurate. Our own searches resulted in genuine news articles from national and local media that cited credible sources.:The fact that searching for any three-digit number followed by the words ""new cases"" results in genuine news articles about COVID-19 does not reveal that the world is being ""played."" Quite the contrary: Testing this ""conspiracy theory"" actually shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is a real and widespread threat. Variation of a ThemeThis rumor appears to be an offshoot of a similar conspiracy theory that circulated last month. Previously, the word on the internet was that COVID-19 data was suspicious because a number of cities around the world had reported that there had been ""322"" cases or deaths from coronavirus. The fact that multiple locations had reported the same number of cases, according to proponents of this theory, ""proved"" that this pandemic was manufactured.Again, this is simply a matter of probability. With thousands of cities, states, countries, government organizations, academic institutions, and newspapers around the world reporting daily on COVID-19 cases and deaths, it is inevitable that some numbers are going to be repeated. :USA Today reported:The content of the claim is ridiculous, as is the implication there is something shady or manufactured in the way these tallies are reported. The volume of media reports on COVID-19, the number of cases and the number of local and regional units of government means there is ample opportunity for tallies to add up to just about any number, particularly in the low triple digits. Google searches prove out that 322 isn't even a particularly common number. "
162,162,454.TrollsBotsUsefulIdio,"On 20 September 2017, just hours after a consortium of high-profile figures from the American entertainment industry, news media and intelligence community formally announced the formation of the Committee to Investigate Russia (CIR), social media bots, paid trolls, and ""useful idiots"" kicked into high gear.The newly-formed organization was launched by director and actor Rob Reiner, with aims to ""help Americans recognize and understand the gravity of Russia's continuing attacks on our democracy"". The web site aggregates relevant information about the Russian active measures, hacking and collusion investigations into one place and offers links to relevant news stories, timelines, and a list of key players.Its inaugural video features Academy Award-winning actor Morgan Freeman cautioning Americans in his famous baritone about Russian influence operations and saying in regards to Russian interference in the 2016 election, ""We were attacked. We are at war."" But even as the organization aims to point the spotlight on the Kremlin's attempts to influence Americans' political and social behavior, predictably, Russia-linked bots and trolls retaliated with social media-driven attacks that followed now-familiar patterns.:Andrew Weisburd, non-resident fellow at Alliance for Securing Democracy (a bipartisan, transatlantic initiative housed at The German Marshall Fund of the United States) and one of the researchers behind Hamilton68, a real-time tool that tracks Russian influence operations on Twitter, told us that the reaction seems driven in part by the success of countermeasures like CIR, which are elevating the American public's awareness of a hostile world power's efforts to influence them:It is certainly *a* type of attack, not the only one, but one that to me suggests it they are increasingly sensitive to being held accountable for their own actions.Keeping in mind that I'm not privy to Kremlin discussions of the matter, it seems clear to me that repeated public exposure of active measures campaigns, continually driving home the same basic point, that the Kremlin has harmed the United States and is continuing to do so, is very effective. I also suspect that Russians may put more stock in what celebrities say than many Americans do. If Steven Seagal's opinion matters, so does Morgan Freeman's. Certainly, as dedicated propagandists, they would see the value in Freeman delivering the CIR message.(Seagal, while perhaps most famous for starring in 1992's Under Siege, has in recent years occupied himself with making a string of low-budget, direct-to-video action movies -- and with building a friendship with President Vladimir Putin, who offered him Russian citizenship in November 2016.):The way the attack on CIR spread was not unlike the way the Russian government helps boost other narratives it finds favorable to its own interests, such as the debunked Seth Rich conspiracy theory that posited Rich, a murdered Democratic National Committee staffer, had provided document-dumping site WikiLeaks with thousands of stolen DNC emails.As with the Rich story, the message attacking CIR was amplified with a network of Kremlin-funded news outlets, social media bots, trolls, and ""useful idiots"". State-funded news outlets like Tass and RT slammed Freeman for starring in the video. Through Tass, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov mockingly diagnosed Freeman with ""emotional strain"":Many performing artists easily succumb to becoming victims of emotional strain with no real information about the real state of things They become victims of an emotionally-charged, self-exalted status, an extension of some sort of McCarthyism, I would say. It fades away over time.RT (formerly Russia Today) published two stories about the video attacking Freeman within an hour of each other::Like clockwork, social media bot and troll accounts fired up on Twitter, tweeting hashtags like ""#StopMorganLie"". Before long, Freeman was a trending topic, according to Hamilton68:Listen to Kremlin regarding what is or is not an effective way to combat active measures. #Hamilton68 https://t.co/CgBKparyu8 pic.twitter.com/Ygs6iE8q9c-- (((aweisburd))) (@webradius) September 20, 2017Then the story got picked up by what Russia experts term ""useful idiots."" As Weisburd, Clint Watts, and J.M. Berger (the team that created the Hamilton68 dashboard) wrote in a 6 November 2016 explainer, ""useful idiots"" play a key role in circulating Russian propaganda in influence campaigns known as ""active measures""::Russian active measures use a blend of overt and covert channels to distribute political, financial, social, and calamitous messages (see above). During the Soviet era, ""white"" active measures were overt information outlets directly attributable to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Today, RT and Sputnik push Kremlin-approved English-language news on television and the Internet. These outlets broadcast a mix of true information (the vast majority of content), manipulated or skewed stories, and strategically chosen falsehoods. RT's slogan, ""Question More,"" aptly fits their reporting style -- seeding ideas of conspiracy or wrongdoing without actually proving anything.This ""white"" content provides ammunition for ""gray"" measures, which employ less overt outlets controlled by Russia, as well as so-called useful idiots that regurgitate Russian themes and ""facts"" without necessarily taking direction from Russia or collaborating in a fully informed manner.During the Cold War, gray measures used semi-covert Communist parties, friendship societies, and non-governmental organizations to engage in party-to-party and people-to-people campaigns. Today, gray measures on social media include conspiracy websites, data dump websites, and seemingly credible news aggregators that amplify disinformation and misinformation.:Conspiracy sites include outlets such as InfoWars and Zero Hedge, along with a host of lesser-known sites that repeat and repackage the same basic content for both right- and left-wing consumers. Sometimes, these intermediaries will post the same stories on sites with opposite political orientations.Conspiracy site InfoWars did indeed pick up the story. Editor-at-large Paul Joseph Watson wrote a post mirroring the story pushed by Tass, and then produced a three-minute YouTube rant in response, as did fellow conspiracy-pushing web site ZeroHedge.com. Before long, the Kremlin's attack on Freeman became a prominent story in conventional news outlets the day after the committee launched, just as with the Seth Rich conspiracy.Speaking to NPR on 20 August 2017, Watts, a Fox Fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute and a former FBI agent, explained how Twitter is in this way a hugely effective platform for influencing the public, even if much of the public doesn't use Twitter, because it is heavily used among journalists as well as propagandists. A topic trending on Twitter has the potential become ubiquitous simply because the news media follows it, and the Russians have learned to capitalize on that, Watts said::....Twitter is the means by which you can disseminate a message globally the fastest. If you put something out on Twitter, mainstream news, TV producers, global media outlets - they are watching Twitter because they're all trying to stay ahead of the news cycle. They then take news that comes from these sources. And then they build their stories out on mainstream outlets. So you'll often hear Americans say, well, I'm not on Twitter, so I'm not being influenced. Actually, that's not exactly how it works. Twitter is the best way to propagate a message across all social media. It is the best platform that you can use to get global dissemination."
163,163,398.YouTubeRemovesVerifi,"YouTube removed multiple channels named ""Fox News"" and ""Fox News Alert"" following an Oct. 1 Snopes investigation that found the channels were pumping out disinformation to millions of subscribers.But these channels were not managed by or affiliated with the Fox News Channel. They had a combined total of millions of subscribers, and several of them even had YouTube verification badges. They likely received that special status in the past based on previous non-political content. Based on our own recent reporting of a similar network on Facebook, all of the YouTube channels appeared to be managed from outside of the U.S.The YouTube channels in question posted lengthy videos from real shows that were broadcast on Fox News. However, the thumbnails for the videos were altered to push disinformation that falsely claimed U.S. President Joe Biden was either dying or going to jail, and that former U.S. President Donald Trump was coming back to the White House this year. This was similar to a debunked QAnon conspiracy theory that recently led to federal authorities worrying of potential violence from Trump supporters when such disinformation inevitably failed to come true.: Despite the verification badge and Fox News logos, this was not an official Fox News YouTube channel.We found several different YouTube channels named ""Fox News"" or ""Fox News Alert"" that may have been managed by the same people. They were removed between Oct. 1-3, after we contacted a YouTube spokesperson for comment about our findings. A message was added to all of the accounts that were removed, saying: ""This account has been terminated due to multiple or severe violations of YouTube's policy against spam, deceptive practices, and misleading content or other Terms of Service violations."":A study of the Fox News clips that were posted to the channels showed that the videos likely received a combined total of at least tens of millions of views. This does not include views for other non-political videos on the same accounts.While the channels above were removed, at least one remained. As of Oct. 4, the one channel that prompted our investigation was still available with its more than 883,000 subscribers. We were initially tipped off by a TikTok video. In that video, a TikTok user showed that he was recommended a video in his YouTube ""Home"" feed that came from a suspicious yet verified YouTube channel, ""Fox News Alert."" :The YouTube channel shown in the TikTok video has since changed its name to ""FoBIRD,"" and no political content was publicly visible. It appeared that someone managing the account may have changed the visibility status of the political videos to be unlisted or private, as there was a clear discrepancy of tens of millions of views between the total view count on the channel's ""About"" page versus the total view count after we added up the numbers for all of the publicly visible videos.A Sept. 17 archive from the Wayback Machine confirmed that the ""FoBIRD"" channel did indeed previously post political disinformation, as shown in the TikTok video. This credible snapshot on the Internet Archive preserved what the YouTube account looked like on that day, providing evidence of the conduct in which the channel had been engaged.As of Oct. 1, a YouTube spokesperson told us it was investigating the channels. We will update this story if we receive further information on the removal of these channels."
164,164,570.AreCharitableNGOsTra,"Claim:NGOs like Doctors Without Borders are profiting from human smuggling in the Mediterranean Sea.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In mid-July 2017, a group of young adults from Europe and North America chartered a boat and set out on a mission (named ""Defend Europe"") in which their stated goal was to block migrants making the dangerous sea crossing from Libya to Italy into Europe. Their plan involved blocking rescue ships operated by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working to prevent those migrants from drowning.:Defend Europe's pretext is their claim that the charities are profiting off illicit human smuggling or trafficking, which has become endemic in the migratory route. For example, Martin Sellner, a representative from the group, told Reuters at the Sicilian port city of Catania on 21 July 2017:There is a difference between saving lives and smuggling people to Europe. What they are doing in fact is making millions of dollars for human trafficking rings.We have found absolutely no evidence to suggest the NGOs involved in search and rescue in the Mediterranean are enriching themselves with smuggling, although this is a popular conspiracy theory among anti-immigrant groups angry at the high number of people making the journey into Europe.Defend Europe did not respond to questions we sent them asking for proof of their accusation, but they appear to be conflating the fact that while smugglers are involved in putting people on dangerous vessels and sending them out to sea, NGOs are rescuing migrants from these conditions, not profiting from them. Although the NGOs have been accused of creating a ""pull"", or at least a link in transit for stranded migrants headed to Europe, they have not ever been officially accused of criminal smuggling or trafficking.:There are eight NGOs operating rescue ships on the Mediterranean, including Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders, known best by the French acronym MSF); SOS Mediterranee (France); Save the Children; Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS) (Malta); Proactiva Open Arms (Spain); and the German groups Sea-Watch, Sea-Eye and Jugend Rettet.Izabella Cooper, spokeswoman for the European Union border management agency Frontex, told us in an e-mailed statement:I would like to make it very clear that Frontex has never accused the NGOs of collusion. Saving lives is an international obligation for all those who operate at sea. The smugglers operating in Libya are taking advantage of this. Frontex has noted an important change in the way the smugglers operating in Libya run their dirty business since 2014:(1) The Search and rescue area has changed in the past: while in 2011 the boats were arriving all the way to Lampedusa, in 2014 the SAR area was half way between Italy and Libya, in 2016 and 2017 SAR area moved to the limit of the Libyan territorial waters.:(2) The number of people travelling on board of the dinghies has increased: While in 2014 smugglers put on average 90 persons on board of a 10-meter-long dinghies, in 2016 and in 2017 we see as many as 170 travelling on boats of the same size. (3) The quality of the materials from which the boats are made has dramatically worsened in the past 2 years -- the rubber is thinner and the boats made of one chamber now (used to be thicker and made of multiple chambers).(4) While in 2014 the quantity of fuel was sufficient for the boats to make longer journeys, now the fuel is only sufficient for the boats to leave the Libyan territorial waters. The same is valid for the drinking water and food. (5) Furthermore, recently we have also noticed that the smugglers remove the engines from the boats when they see a rescue boat nearby leaving the boat full of people adrift and in danger, in order to re-use the engine for another trip.The Italian coast guard on 2 August 2017 seized the Iuventa, a ship operated by the German NGO Jugend Rettet, on suspicion of aiding illegal immigration, and accused the crew of having contact with smugglers. However, Italian authorities stopped short of saying the NGO had colluded with smugglers for financial benefit, saying they believe the motivation was ""exclusively humanitarian"". A previous investigation concluded in May 2017 by Catania's chief prosecutor Carmelo Zuccaro also found no evidence that the humanitarian groups were or are receiving illicit money from smugglers.:The Defend Europe group, which is part of the white nationalist ""Identitarian"" movement, crowdfunded nearly USD$200,000 by way of notorious Internet troll Chuck C. Johnson's web site WeSearchr to hire a Mongolian-flagged boat called the C-Star to carry out their mission -- although it's unclear what they are doing. According to media reports, they had been detained at least twice, once by authorities at the Suez Canal and again in Cyprus, where they lost five Sri Lankan members of the ship's crew who disembarked and then immediately applied for asylum.Meanwhile, Enzo Bianco, mayor of Catania, has asked authorities to block the ship from docking in that city's port because he feared their presence would further inflame an already tense situation. Defend Europe did not respond to our questions, which included a query about their current location and where they planned to travel, but posted videos in several European languages of themselves aboard the boat on 3 August 2017.Of all the routes that migrants cross globally, the Mediterranean via Libya is by far the deadliest. Yet hundreds of thousands are making that journey to Europe and are expected to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. They come from a mixture of mainly Middle Eastern and African countries for a variety of reasons, according to a United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees report; some flee violence or conflict from war-torn places like Syria to seek asylum, while others are looking for better economic prospects. Others still are victims of human trafficking or environmental crises that drive them from their home regions. The instability and general lawlessness in Libya that currently prevails creates fertile ground for human smugglers, who pack people onto increasingly dangerous vessels. As many as 950 people are believed to have died in 2015 when one such vessel capsized.:NGOs took on a high profile role in pulling people to safety after the Italian navy shuttered a short-lived but successful rescue operation known as ""Mare Nostrum"" (""Our Sea"" in Latin) that ran from October 2013 to October 2014, but was cut due to lack of support from other European Union countries. Mare Nostrum was initially launched in response to public outcry over a shipwreck that killed more than 300 people near the Italian island of Lampedusa in 2013. When that program ended, aid agency MSF -- a 45-year-old NGO that brings doctors and medical personnel to crisis areas -- took up the mission along with Frontex, which provided search and rescue resources (but at a fraction of the budget of Mare Nostrum). Other aid groups also joined in.MSF spokeswoman Sandra Murillo told us:MSF currently has two boats actively searching for boats in distress in international waters north of Libya: MV Aquarius run in in partnership with SOS MEDITERRANEE, and Prudence. MSF medical teams onboard treat violence-related injuries linked to detention, torture and other ill-treatment, including sexual violence, that people experienced in Libya. Medics treat skin diseases, dehydration, hypothermia, scabies and serious injuries such as chemical burns caused by fuel mixing with sea water in the boats. Pregnant women are cared for by midwives onboard and several babies have been born safely at sea. Lifesaving emergency care is also provided in emergency rooms on the boats or through medical evacuations, when needed. In the first six months of 2017, NGOs have completed 35 percent of the total of rescue operations in the Central Mediterranean. MSF alone has rescued and brought to safety more than 16,000 people.:As of the end of July, just over 100,000 people have arrived on European shores in 2017, 94,802 of them in Italy. In the same timeframe, 2,385 people died while making the journey, according to the International Organization for Migrants. In the most recent reported tragedy, a boat carrying two women and five children capsized off the Turkish coast, killing all aboard.We found no evidence to support the claim that these NGOs are involved in illicit smuggling or trafficking activities. Although allegations has been leveled by critics that their presence encourages migrants to make the dangerous Mediterranean crossing and Italian authorities have at least twice investigated accusations of illegal activities, no concrete proof has appeared. Organizations like Frontex and the United Nations stress that the non-governmental organizations' role in saving lives is crucial."
165,165,189.DidUSIntelligenceEli,"Claim:The intelligence community ""secretly eliminated"" a requirement that whistleblowers provide firsthand knowledge of alleged wrongdoings, allowing the complaint about Trump's dealings with Ukraine to be filed.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In September 2019, whistleblower allegations that U.S. President Donald Trump held back military aid to Ukraine in an effort to obtain damaging information on a political rival led to an impeachment inquiry and an ongoing scandal.:It wouldn't be the 2010s if the fallout didn't include a conspiracy theory circulating in the right-wing media ecosystem. In this case, the conspiracy theory was given a major platform in the form of a tweet by Trump that his supporters widely shared:WHO CHANGED THE LONG STANDING WHISTLEBLOWER RULES JUST BEFORE SUBMITTAL OF THE FAKE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT? DRAIN THE SWAMP!-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019The claim originated on The Federalist website, which published a story on Sept. 27 that was not only inaccurate but played on the ""deep state"" conspiracy theory, an idea now popular among both fringe fanatics and White House officials alike. It posits that U.S. intelligence agencies are scheming against Trump.:The Federalist story implied that the intelligence community changed existing rules so that the ""anti-Trump complaint"" could be filed on Aug. 12 using secondhand information. ""Between May 2018 and August 2019, the intelligence community secretly eliminated a requirement that whistleblowers provide direct, first-hand knowledge of alleged wrongdoings,"" The Federalist reported.The Federalist story included purported screenshots of previous and current versions of the Disclosure of Urgent Concern form. The current form allows the whistleblower to check a box indicating that the person either learned of the information firsthand or from others, whereas the previous form contained the following language:But as Julian Sanchez, senior fellow at the libertarian think tank Cato Institute, pointed out, even the previous version shown above doesn't say there was a ""requirement that whistleblowers provide direct, first-hand knowledge of alleged wrongdoings."" The law has never required them to do so.:Sanchez pointed out that the form pictured above contains a ""description of the Inspector General's (IG) standard for making a credibility determination, as required by statute, within 14 days of the submission of a complaint. According to that guidance, the IG would not make a finding of credibility, and thus transmit the complaint to the [Director of National Intelligence], unless the DNI was in possession of direct evidence supporting the claim.""It does not say, Sanchez continued, ""that whistleblowers may not submit reports based on secondhand knowledge, but rather that such reports will not be escalated to the DNI unless the IG can obtain more.""The Intelligence Community Inspector General's Office (ICIG) was forced to issue a statement on Sept. 30 correcting the record. The statement read, in part:The Disclosure of Urgent Concern form the Complainant submitted on August 12, 2019 is the same form the ICIG has had in place since May 24, 2018, which went into effect before Inspector General [Michael] Atkinson entered on duty as the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community on May 29, 2018, following his swearing in as the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community on May 17, 2018. Although the form requests information about whether the Complainant possesses first-hand knowledge about the matter about which he or she is lodging the complaint, there is no such requirement set forth in the statute. In fact, by law the Complainant - or any individual in the Intelligence Community who wants to report information with respect to an urgent concern to the congressional intelligence committees - need not possess first-hand information in order to file a complaint or information with respect to an urgent concern. The ICIG cannot add conditions to the filing of an urgent concern that do not exist in law. Since Inspector General Atkinson entered on duty as the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, the ICIG has not rejected the filing of an alleged urgent concern due to a whistleblower's lack of first-hand knowledge of the allegations.:In other words, the entire premise of The Federalist story is wrong. No requirement exists that whistleblowers provide firsthand knowledge of alleged wrong-doings, and changing the rules would have required an act of Congress.Tom Devine, legal director for the watchdog non-profit Government Accountability Project, called The Federalist story a ""shameless legal bluff.""""No bureaucrat has the lawful authority to change the rules of the game for whistleblower rights,"" Devine told us. ""Not even the president can change that unilaterally."" So how did the claim come about? It's true that the wording on an explanatory form for whistleblowers was changed, but the rules were not. The ICIG's statement notes that the wording was revised because ""certain language in those forms and, more specifically, the informational materials accompanying the forms, could be read -- incorrectly -- as suggesting that whistleblowers must possess first-hand information in order to file an urgent concern complaint with the congressional intelligence committees."":Devine added that government whistleblowers who report allegations of wrongdoing based on hearsay are still valuable resources in ferreting out government waste, corruption, and wrongdoing.""If we restricted all credible government investigations to those with whistleblowers who have firsthand information, we'd cancel out 90% of law enforcement activity,"" Devine said. ""Whistleblower investigations are routinely based on hearsay.""The ICIG's Sept. 30 statement additionally noted that the whistleblower's complaint did not contain only secondhand, ""unsubstantiated assertions."" The whistleblower ""checked two relevant boxes: The first box stated that, 'I have personal and/or direct knowledge of events or records involved'; and the second box stated that, 'Other employees have told me about events or records involved.'""In summary, the ICIG statement said: [The] whistleblower submitted the appropriate Disclosure of Urgent Concern form that was in effect as of August 12, 2019, and had been used by the ICIG since May 24, 2018. The whistleblower stated on the form that he or she possessed both first-hand and other information. The ICIG reviewed the information provided as well as other information gathered and determined that the complaint was both urgent and that it appeared credible. From the moment the ICIG received the whistleblower's filing, the ICIG has worked to effectuate Congress's intent, and the whistleblower's intent, within the rule of law. The ICIG will continue in those efforts on behalf of all whistleblowers in the Intelligence Community.:"
166,166,495.USGovernmentShipsRad,"Claim:High diabetes rates among African-Americans are caused by a genocidal government plot to ship weaponized radioactive milk to black communities.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In August 2017, a years-old video excerpt from a presentation by ""independent scientist"" and conspiracy theorist Leuren Moret went viral on Facebook. In the short clip, Moret claimed that the relatively high rates of diabetes found in poor and ethnic minority communities in the United States are caused by the deliberate shipment of radioactive milk to those communities as part of a U.S. government policy of genocide against black Americans::Why do [poor and ethnic minority communities in New York] have much higher rates of diabetes than the rest of the affluent part of New York City? The answer is that we discovered, after Chernobyl, that the state milk boards are taking the most contaminated radioactive milk from dairies near nuclear power plants and they're shipping that into black, inner-city communities where it's sold in the mom and pop stores ... U.S. national policy is to genocide the black communities with radiation.The video clip was originally disseminated to Facebook in April 2015 via the Indigengine page, and a month later it was also posted by Your Black Reality. The latter instance of the video experienced an explosion of Facebook shares in August and September 2017.Although it has proved popular, Moret's claim lacks both a scientific basis and supporting evidence and is false on a number of levels. Its largest scientific misstep is one as old as time: offering mere correlation as support for an untenable hypothesis.Black Americans and Type II Diabetes:African-American adults do have higher rates of diabetes than the general population. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the prevalence of diabetes is 9.4 percent among American adults overall, but 12.7 percent among black American adults. Although the increased risk for Type II diabetes among non-Latino black men and women is well known and robustly documented, complete explanations for the relationship are lacking.Scientists agree that both biological and socioeconomic factors are likely at play. One partial explanation is that men and women of African descent appear to differ from other ethnicities in the ways in which their bodies metabolize glucose and regulate its levels, according to a 2012 review of the topic:The higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes in minorities compared with [non hispanic white] populations is partially attributable to differences in glucose metabolism and homeostasis. Compared with their [non hispanic white] counterparts and independent of [body fat, non hispanic blacks] have greater hyperinsulinemia [an elevated amount of insulin in the blood relative to glucose] and insulin resistance [a reduced ability for insulin to affect glucose levels].:Scientists have considered a number of social factors to explain the difference as well, such as access to health care, availability of healthy foods, household status, and others. A 2015 study conducted by researchers with the National Minority Quality Forum, described on their web site as a ""research and educational organization dedicated to ensuring that high-risk racial and ethnic populations and communities receive optimal health care"", noted that although numerous adverse health factors may apply to everyone living in America's poorest neighborhoods (regardless of one's ethnicity), black Americans are more likely to reside in such areas:Among Black adults aged >45 years at baseline, residence in the most deprived neighborhoods significantly increased odds of obesity, high blood pressure, lower HDL-cholesterol, elevated fasting glucose and markers of inflammation. White adults living in these neighborhoods also had increased likelihood of several cardiometabolic risk factors. However, Blacks were roughly four times more likely to live in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods than Whites.Moret's assertion that radioactive milk explains differing rates of diabetes ignores myriad other racial disparities in health outcomes that likely could not be answered with one single, milk-based hypothesis. A famous 2006 paper nicknamed the ""Eight Americas"" study divided the country into eight ethno-sociographic groups (Asians, northland low-income rural whites, Middle America, low-income whites in Appalachia and the Mississippi Valley, western Native Americans, black Middle America, low-income southern rural blacks, and high-risk urban blacks) and investigated the disparities in health care and mortality between these populations. The group which Moret's map of New York highlights includes poor, urban, and predominantly black neighborhoods that would fall into that study's ""high-risk urban blacks"" grouping, and the ""Eight Americas"" study found that within this group, young and middle-aged members faced the largest health disparities when compared to the most affluent groups. The study noted multiple varied types and causes of such disparities::The major mortality gradients in these age groups are observed for injuries, cardiovascular diseases, and other noncommunicable causes such as liver cirrhosis and diabetes. Injuries are especially important for the observed mortality gradients between the ages of 15 and 44.If radioactive milk were the cause of diabetes, is it also the cause of physical injuries and cardiovascular disease? Moret provided no mechanism to explain the myriad other factors that increase early mortality in these communities, which are also equally correlated with the geographic and racial disparities she speaks of. It would be a challenging argument to suggest that radioactive milk is the cause of each and every one of them, or, conversely, that it affects only one aspect of these neighborhoods' health outcomes.Radioactive Milk in the Inner Cities Despite a veritable smorgasbord of potential explanations for higher rates of diabetes in poor urban black communities, Moret decided to go with radioactive milk as an explanation for the relationship. This is an enigmatic choice for several reasons, albeit one that makes a grain of sense when one considers that Moret's main cause is fearmongering about nuclear power.:Regardless, the radioactive milk hypothesis fails on both scientific and historical grounds. It is unclear in the brief video clip exactly what Moret is talking about with respect to shipments to inner cities of contaminated milk from areas ambiguously ""near"" nuclear power plants, but an article published on her web site seems to hint at a 1930s farm program as evidence, though the article provides no sourcing for it:It so happened that there existed a federal program for controlling the shipment of most of the milk in the nation from farms to the consumers in the cities that had been developed in the 1930s in order to protect the income of farmers when the milk from their farms occasionally did not taste well.The program forced wholesalers who bought the milk to pay the normal price, even when on some occasions there was a problem with the quality of the milk, which could be diluted with the milk from other areas that did not have such a problem. Dilution of the poorly tasting milk with milk from other farms was therefore believed to be a way to solve the problem.What Moret (who did not respond to our request for clarification) seems to be talking about is the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937. Part of the intent behind this act was to stabilize pricing in the milk market and ensure a constant supply of milk, which at the time was subject to major transportation losses, price fixing through unregulated farmers' co-ops, worker strikes, and inconsistent quality. What Moret is likely referencing is the legal classification between Grade I raw milk (which can be used in the production of actual milk for human consumption), and Grade II raw milk (which can be used for animal feed or in cheese and other secondary products).:For a variety of reasons, the law essentially turned the entire federal milk market into a co-op, whereby dairy farmers split revenues from the sales of both grades of milk evenly as a way of sustaining regular prices and eliminating waste. What the law did not include was anything about the transportation of low quality milk to the inner cities, but Moret nonetheless, makes this claim of it:Thus, [the law makes it] possible to direct milk shipments from farms close to nuclear plants into the inner city areas where few White people lived, in the hope that dilution at the dairies and processing facilities would make any adverse effects on human health statistically undetectable.Although the law may have further facilitated the mixing of milk from different geographic areas, nothing Moret writes in her argument provides any semblance of support for the notion that large quantities of milk are being transported from areas near nuclear reactors to the inner cities -- in large part because no such evidence exists, and in small part because it represents a gross misunderstanding of the law's intent and effect.:Using a vague description of an agricultural law meant to aid dairy farmers which was passed long before nuclear power plants existed, Moret argues that an incidental discovery of radioactive iodine in milk potentially linked to the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 offers clear evidence of a concerted effort to transport radioactive milk to America's inner cities. To make this argument, she cites reporting published in a controversial 1990 book titled Deadly Deceit: Low-level Radiation, High-level Cover-Up:When the authors [of Deadly Deceit] examined the reported levels of Iodine-131 [a radioactive byproduct of fission reactions] in the milk in May and August 1986 for seven cities along the east-coast from Baltimore, Maryland down to Norfolk, Virginia, the highest levels of Iodine-131 were found in Washington in the District of Columbia both for May and August, followed by Baltimore [...].But as the authors point out, it is unlikely that the high concentrations of Iodine-131 in Washington and Baltimore, more than twice as high as for the other cities, could be explained solely by the fallout from Chernobyl. First of all, the highest levels of Iodine-131 measured in the rain in May of 1986 was reported for Virginia, whereas the levels measured in the milk in Virginia were less than half of those in Washington and Baltimore.:Secondly, the level of Iodine-131, which is only produced by nuclear fission, continued to be highest in August 1986, three months after the fallout from Chernobyl arrived, so that with its short half-life of about one week it should have been completely undetectable 12 weeks later. But most importantly is the fact that since there are no dairy cows in the small District of Columbia in which Washington is located as well as no nuclear reactors.There is no way that the high concentration of iodine-131 in the Washington milk could be explained by anything else than extraordinarily high levels in the milk shipped into the city, due to emissions from the nuclear reactors in the surrounding states with high levels persisting through August.Here would be a good place to point out that, in fact, very few dairy farms exist in any urban settings due to the rural environment such farms by necessity must inhabit. As such, it is nearly a given that milk will be shipped from somewhere else to cities.Moret's only evidence of targeted radioactive milk shipments to the inner cities, then, is that in August 1986 two cities with larger relative black populations than other east coast cities (Baltimore and Washington, D.C.), had higher levels of radiation in their milk. Yet she provides no documentation showing an intentional shipment of more radioactive milk to specific neighborhoods within any of these cities, even though that claim is her primary thesis.:Additionally, radioactivity in milk is regularly tested as part of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Total Diet Study, which carefully monitors foodstuffs for a range of potentially harmful substances, including radionuclides. If evidence for Moret's conspiracy theory existed, would it surely not be found more conclusively in these data and not in a single data point from August 1986?We analyzed the results of the Total Diet Study from 1992-2005 and 2006-2014, but we turned up not a single instance of milk's containing radionuclide levels that even came close to levels that the FDA considers to be potentially harmful.Could Radioactive Milk Cause Diabetes?The final problem with Moret's argument is the connection between low-level radiation and diabetes. Though Moret makes great pains to suggest the hazards of low-level radiation have been intentionally minimized by the government, diabetes has been linked to radiation exposure in only a few groups, such as animals exposed to heavy and acute amounts of radiation, or childhood cancer survivors who underwent radiation treatment earlier in their lives; both groups were exposed to radiation at levels that are much higher than would be found in milk. In response to our queries, the American Diabetes Association told us that they ""are unaware of any link between radiation and diabetes at any levels of radiation that would regularly be encountered in the U.S."":Moret uses the disparity in health outcomes between impoverished, inner-city black Americans and other populations (arguably one of the most pressing healthcare injustices facing the United States) to push a conspiracy theory against nuclear power that lacks both evidence and logic. As such, we rank this claim as false."

According to this report, SVR analysts began expressing ""urgent concern"" earlier this year when the main ""elements/factions"" of the feared Viktor Bout's international arms smuggling crime organization began arriving in the Republic of Albania -- that is the only Muslim nation in Europe.None of this was true.  The article was just another fabrication from the conspiracy-mongering fake news site WhatDoesItMean.com and putative blogger ""Sorcha Faal,"" of whom RationalWiki notes:Sorcha Faal is the alleged author of an ongoing series of ""reports"" published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don't think much of it. Each report resembles a news story in its style, but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality (e.g. ""American Rebel Forces Attack Gas Pipelines, Explode Trains As US Civil War Nears"") and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service in the same article) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don't contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish.:"
168,168,64.HenryFordandAirCondi,"Claim:The brothers who invented automobile air conditioning pulled a fast one on Henry Ford. Rating:FalseAbout this rating This bit of humor is another well-traveled item that should be easily recognizable as a joke but is nonetheless frequently mailed to us for verification:Example:   [Collected via e-mail, 1993]:It was a sweltering August day in 1937 when the Cohen brothers entered the posh Dearborn, Michigan, offices of Henry Ford, the car maker. ""Mr. Ford,"" announced Norman Cohen, the eldest of the three. ""We have a remarkable invention that will revolutionize the automobile industry.""Ford looked skeptical, but their threat to offer it to the competition kept his interest piqued. ""We would like todemonstrate it to you in person.""After a little cajoling, they brought Mr. Ford outside and asked him to enter a black automobile parked in front of the building.Hyman Cohen, the middle brother, opened the door of the car.""Please step inside, Mr. Ford.""""What!"" shouted the tycoon, ""Are you crazy? It must be two hundred degrees in that car!""""It is,"" smiled the youngest brother, Max, ""but sit down Mr. Ford, and push the white button."":Intrigued, Ford pushed the button. All of a sudden a whoosh of freezing air started blowing from vents allaround the car, and within seconds the automobile was not only comfortable, it was quite cool.""This is amazing!"" exclaimed Ford. ""How much do you want for the patent?""Norman spoke up, ""The price is one million dollars."" Then he paused. ""And there is something else: The name 'Cohen Brothers Air-Conditioning' must be stamped right next to the Ford logo!""""Money is no problem,"" retorted Ford, ""but no way will I have a Jewish name next to my logo on my cars!'They haggled back and forth for a while and finally they settled. Five million dollars, but the Cohens' name would be left off. However, the first names of the Cohen brothers would be forever emblazoned upon the console of every Ford air conditioning system.And that is why, even today, whenever you enter a Ford vehicle, you will see those three names clearly printed on the air conditioning control panel::NORM, HI and MAXUndoubtedly the use of specific names and dates (somewhat unusual in this form of humor) misleads some readers into interpreting it as a  real-life anecdote rather than a joke. More important, although the story requires no additional explanation to be seen as funny, its key element is a historical context that may be lost on younger readers.The missing context is that Henry Ford was a notorious anti-Semite who believed Jews were behind an international banking conspiracy intent upon seizing control of the world's financial systems and destroying American manufacturing. He devoted whole pages of his 1923 autobiography, My Life and Work, to disparaging Jews. He bought the Dearborn Independent in 1919 and turned that newspaper into an outlet for running full-length articles (and later whole issues) attacking the ""Jewish banking conspiracy."" He presumed the hoax booklet The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion -- a forgery concocted to stir up hatred of Jews by furnishing proof that Jewish leaders were secretly planning to attain world domination -- was real and serialized it in his newspaper, where installments were run for 91 weeks under the headline ""The International Jew."":So, this joke is more than just a tale of three inventors who manage to cleverly sneak their names onto someone else's product; it's also a put-down of Henry Ford and his anti-Semitism. Not only do three Jewish inventors arrange a way to display their names in every car produced by Ford despite his unyielding objections to placing ""Jewish names"" on his product, they manipulate him into agreeing to a quintupled price (a staggering $5 million) under the belief that his paying extra millions of dollars will keep their names off his automobiles.Yet even minus the historical context of Henry Ford's feelings about Jews, the story works for the same reason the $250 cookie recipe legend does -- at its heart, it's a tale of the little guy's successfully taking on the large corporation and winning. We like tales in which the underdog comes out on top because such stories leave open the possibility that maybe when it's our turn to go up against the big guys, we too might win. At the very least, such stories foster a sense of hope. In this case, that the underdogs succeed through a bit of sneakiness seems nothing but appropriate because we don't view them as having been fairly treated.For the record, as far as we know the first American automobile in which factory-installed air conditioning was offered as an option was the 1940 Packard.:Variations:   Different versions of this joke use a variety of Jewish-sounding last names for the brothers, including Katz, Rosenberg, and Goldberg."
169,169,435.DoPicsofPutinsChinPr,"Claim:A photograph of Russian President Vladimir Putin on a visit to Mariupol in which his chin appears noticeably different from other photos of him, proves that he uses a body double. Rating:FalseAbout this rating As Russian President Vladimir Putin made a surprise visit to Russian-occupied regions in Ukraine in March 2023, photographs and video footage of him led to renewed rumors about his use of a body double. :On March 20, 2023, a Twitter account used by Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, posted a series of photographs of Putin. The tweet asked, ""Which one do you think is the real one?"" It compared pictures of Putin purportedly taken in early 2023, and then in March 2023 in Ukrainian territories, in which his chin in the center image looked noticeably different from the other two.We also received queries from our readers who wondered if such images proved that Putin was using a body double. One reader pointed out, ""His recent public appearance in Ukraine, with how close Putin was to other people, when he usually keeps a clear distance from everyone, has the rumor mill spinning."" :The center image in which Putin's chin appears to be sunken into his neck is a screenshot of a video in which he is touring Mariupol, and not Sevastopol as the tweet claimed. We found the footage with the exact shots in a New York Times video that cites the original source as being Russian state media. A screenshot from the video shows the chin exactly as it is depicted in the above tweet. From this angle it indeed appears that Putin looks very different. (Screenshot via New York Times)However, as he turns his head in the next frame, it is clear that the man in this video is Putin and not a body double. This next shot is visibly Putin, and the change in his chin can be attributed to the angle of the shot, as well as the effects of aging. (Screenshot via New York Times):Indeed, the first and third photographs in the above tweet are also of Putin. The third image is a screenshot from his visit to Russian-occupied Mariupol as well, and can be seen at the 1:58  mark in the video below:The same video later shows Putin inside a building where the portion of the image showing his chin was captured as a screenshot. :The very first image is taken from a speech Putin made in 2020, around three years ago, and not in early 2023 as the tweet claimed. The original photograph can be found on Russian news agency website TASS. The age of the photo could also explain the difference in Putin's chin from then and 2023. While this indeed is Putin visiting Mariupol, based on the range of photographic and video evidence, claims that he uses body doubles are not new. While these claims have never been proven, they have been repeated by Ukrainian officials and have spread online ever since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. Putin is not the only world leader to be subject to such speculation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and U.S. President Joe Biden among others, have faced similar claims. We have often reported on ""body doubles"" as a popular type of conspiracy theory that crops up on the internet when a famous person has a health issue. Putin has reportedly been paranoid about contracting COVID-19 in recent years, adding fuel to claims that he has used a body double in public appearances. :However, the above photographs do not prove that he was using a double on this particular trip, as different shots from the same footage prove that the man who was visiting occupied Mariupol was indeed Putin, and the changes in his appearance can be largely attributed to age and camera angles. We thus rate this claim as ""False."" "
170,170,511.IstheMandalayBaySecu,"Claim:Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos is ""missing.""Rating:FalseAbout this rating In the days following the 1 October 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, various conspiratorial web sites and Internet personalities began casting aspersions on a wounded Mandalay Bay security guard, falsely claiming he was an ""accomplice"" to gunman Stephen Paddock, 64, who killed 58 people and injured hundreds more in the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history before turning the gun on himself.:At about 10:05 P.M., Paddock began firing from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on a crowd of 22,000 people attending an outdoor country music festival. In the minutes before the mass shooting started, Paddock fired 200 bullets into the hotel hallway, wounding security guard Jesus Campos in the leg. Campos has been hailed as a hero for his actions that night, warning a building engineer about the gunfire and helping police evacuate the floor despite his leg wound.As we have reported, there is no evidence Campos was involved in the shooting other than being victimized when he, along with hundreds of others, was wounded in the attack. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, the law enforcement agency leading the investigation, has repeatedly said that Paddock was the only shooter that night. Nevertheless, various disreputable web sites have already been busily spreading misinformation that Campos was implicated as a second gunman, and that authorities had arrested him as such. Both claims are completely untrue and have been roundly debunked.Conspiracy theories were kicked up anew on 12 October 2017, when the 24-year-old Campos abruptly cancelled media interviews, including a scheduled appearance on Sean Hannity's popular Fox News show. According to his union, Campos went to a walk-in medical clinic that night instead. No other explanation for the cancelled appearances has been offered.:Although many may find it unsurprising that a person who narrowly escaped mass murder days earlier would want to lay low, the cancelled appearances caused a cascade of meltdowns among the conspiracy-minded and attention-seeking. For example, in all-capital letters, Ann Coulter tweeted, ""MANDALAY BAY SECURITY GUARD, JESUS CAMPOS, NOW MISSING AFTER SCHEDULING 5 MEDIA INTERVIEWS."" Self-deputized ""investigative journalist"" Laura Loomer declared, ""If #JesusCampos is truly a hero, why would he cancel his interview with @seanhannity ? That's like ripping up a winning lotery [sic] ticket!""Some mainstream news outlets reported that Campos had ""vanished,"" which implied he had disappeared entirely, leaving no trace behind. However, Campos appears to have merely withdrawn from the public eye, while his current whereabouts remain privately known by some (such as LVMPD).LVMPD officer Larry Hadfield told us that Campos is not missing, and reiterated that Paddock had no accomplices when he rained bullets down on the Route 91 Harvest Festival. Hadfield told us, flat-out::[Campos] is not missing. He's not under arrest. We tell people what we know. If they don't believe it but they're going to believe whatever web site, then I don't know what else to tell you.David Hickey, international president of the International Union, Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America, the union that represents Campos, told us the last time he saw the injured guard was the day of his scheduled interviews. Hickey described Campos as ""humble"" and wanting to get his story out so he could leave the traumatic events behind him:When I talked to him he wanted to tell his story, he said he wanted to 'get it all done in one day and move on with my life.'But when Hickey emerged from a meeting just hours before Campos was scheduled to go on Hannity's show, he told us he discovered that the young man, along with another union member and a security guard protecting Campos, had left::We did receive a text from my other officer saying, 'We're on our way to [walk-in clinic] Quick Care.' That was the last response we got. We made multiple calls for two days and received no return calls.We sent an inquiry to Mandalay Bay's parent company, MGM Resorts International, and they sent us the following statement, noting Campos does not wish to be in the limelight:Jesus Campos wants to tell his story at a time and place of his choosing. He's asked that everyone respect his request for privacy. We could not be more proud of Jesus.Campos taped an interview on the NBC talk show hosted by Ellen Degeneres which is set to air on 18 October 2017. Appearing with building engineer Stephen Schuck, previews show Campos describing encountering gunfire in the hallway, feeling a burning sensation and noticing that he was wounded.Although Campos's guard detail created yet another thread to which amateur Internet sleuths could cling, Ryan Graney, who represents the family of Victoria Soto -- a teacher killed protecting her students during the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary massacre -- told us it makes sense that Campos, now the accidental target of conspiracy theorists and ""truthers,"" is under guard::In my rational mind [the fact he has security] makes sense because these people, the hoaxers especially, will go out of their way to take this offline. These people have shown up at Vicki's 5k before. I had a woman follow me into federal court. These people will show up and they will harass the victims.He definitely needs some kind of protection because they will go to great lengths to prove in their paranoid minds what they think is right. They are scary individuals.Sandy Hook ""truthers"" have been on a crusade to prove that the thoroughly covered and well-documented massacre of children was a ""false flag"" engineered by the government in the service of the ""New World Order,"" a ubiquitous but vague conspiracy theory peddled by the likes of InfoWars host Alex Jones, in which a secret but powerful cabal seeks to institute an autocratic global regime which will only be enabled once the government has seized all the guns from Americans. At least two ""truthers"" have been arrested for things like harassing or sending death threats to victims' families. Graney said those same ""truthers"" are currently whipping themselves into an online frenzy over Campos: poring over photographs for supposed discrepancies, attempting to track his whereabouts, and scrutinizing a public database for the Nevada Private Investigator's Licensing Board (a spokesman for the board told us that agency has no jurisdiction over casino security guards like Campos).:Richard A. Patterson, a founding partner of the law firm Owen, Patterson & Owen, which has filed a petition to have the courts appoint a public administrator to oversee Paddock's assets in lieu of pending litigation on behalf of victims, told us that Campos's hesitance to speak to the media and maintain a low profile is not surprising:Based on my clients' experiences, it's a lot just to have the courage to speak publicly once and deal with the exposure in the media and post-traumatic stress they're suffering from. It's reliving the tragedy.It would be very reasonable to expect that Mr. Campos has either been directed by his medical care providers or his family or from his own sense of balance to withdraw from public appearances at this point. I think we owe him the opportunity to get a couple of weeks behind him that will enable him to gather his strength and his emotional focus to be able to deal with these things. In our opinion, he's a hero.This is not the first time a person's lack of desire to speak to the media has been misconstrued as that person being ""missing.""  For months in late 2016, online conspiracy theorists set about searching for signs of Eric Braverman, a former Clinton Foundation executive officer they believed had disappeared due to nefarious activity by the Clintons in an effort silence potential critics. After intense online speculation about his whereabouts, Braverman surfaced in mid-January 2017 to publicly announce he was taking on a new job.:"
171,171,506.IsAllegedCapitolRiot,"Claim:Kevin Seefried, who carried a Confederate flag into the U.S. Capitol during the attack on the building in January 2021, is registered as a Democrat in Delaware.Rating:UnprovenAbout this rating In January 2021, Snopes received several inquiries from readers about the accuracy of a widely shared meme that claimed Kevin Seefried, a Delaware man charged with taking part in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of then-U.S. President Donald Trump, was in fact a registered Democrat and supporter of President Joe Biden.:Seefried came to the attention of the FBI after photographs showed him carrying a Confederate flag inside the halls of Congress. The meme consisted of one of those photographs, along with the following text:""This 'domestic terrorist,' who brought a Confederate flag into the Capitol during this outrageous attack on America has been arrested in his home state of Delaware. His name is Kevin Seefried. He's a registered Democrat and Biden supporter. Is Pelosi going to impeach Biden now too?"":The popularity of the meme can be seen in the following screenshot, which shows just a selection of Facebook posts containing it:As evidence in support of the claim that Seefried is a registered Democrat, some Facebook users cited a listing for a ""Kevin D Seefried"" on the website VoterRecords.com:::However, the only credible evidence available strongly indicates that Seefried is a supporter of Trump, who took part in a destructive effort to overturn the lawful and legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election, which Biden won. In court filings, an FBI special agent wrote that Seefried had said he traveled from Delaware to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6 ""to hear President Trump speak."" Furthermore, the only supposed evidence presented in support of the claim that Seefried is a registered Democrat and Biden supporter is fatally flawed. The voter registration listing came from an unofficial source, and in any case referred to a voter born in 1986, and therefore decades younger than Seefried, who is 51 years old.Since we don't have voter registration information for Seefried, we can't definitively say that he is not a registered Democrat, and so we are issuing a rating of ""Unproven."" However, the available evidence strongly indicates that, whatever his voter registration might be, Seefried acted in support of Trump and took part in an effort to overturn Biden's legitimate victory -- hardly in keeping with the meme's baseless description of him as a ""Biden supporter."":AnalysisThe Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol, which led to several deaths, damaged the reputation of the movement -- spearheaded by Trump -- to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election using baseless conspiracy theories that falsely alleged widespread electoral fraud.As a result, some Trump supporters attempted to distance that movement from the events of that day, falsely claiming that the attack had been planned or perpetrated by left-wing agents provocateurs, in particular antifa (short for ""anti-fascist""). We have addressed and debunked several strands of that conspiracy theory, and the ""Biden supporter Seefried"" meme appears to be just another such example.On Jan. 14, Seefried and his 23-year-old son Hunter were charged with the following three offenses each:Knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authorityViolent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol groundsDepredation of government property.:An affidavit written by an FBI special agent stated that: both Seefried and his son were captured on video breaking into the Capitol through a broken window; that Hunter Seefried had cleared glass from that semi-broken window in order to clear a path for entry; and that once inside, Seefried brandished a Confederate flag through the halls of the Capitol. According to the FBI affidavit, the two men were identified because of a tip-off from one of Hunter's co-workers, who claimed Hunter had bragged about his participation in the attack on the Capitol. The co-worker also recognized Hunter's face from a police flier requesting information from the public about persons of interest from the riot.According to the FBI, both men confirmed their involvement in the attack on the Capitol during interviews conducted on Jan. 12. The affidavit states that Kevin Seefried told federal agents he had travelled from Delaware to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6 in order to hear Trump speak at a rally at the Ellipse, near the White House, and that he had subsequently marched from the Ellipse to the Capitol. Seefried reportedly told the FBI he had brought the Confederate flag with him from Delaware, where it normally flies outside his house.:Worcester County, Maryland court records list Kevin Seefried's month and year of birth as March 1969, meaning he was 51 years old when he was charged. The address listed in those records is located in Laurel, Delaware, and matches the location of his family home, which the Delaware News Journal visited and described in a Jan. 15, 2021 report.The same residential address is found in Worcester County court records for Hunter Seefried, and those records list his month and year of birth as November 1997, meaning he was 23 years old when charged. Given that Kevin Seefried is 51 years old, he could not be the same individual listed as a registered Democrat on VoterRecords.com -- the only piece of supposed evidence put forward to support the claim that Seefried is a secret Biden supporter.However, Seefried's actual voter registration information, if it exists, was not readily available, so we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that he is registered as a Democrat, notwithstanding his current political views. Snopes contacted attorneys for both Kevin and Hunter Seefried, in an effort to clear up those uncertainties, but we did not receive a response in time for publication. :If we receive information that clarifies Seefried's voter registration status, we will update this fact check accordingly. For now, we're issuing a rating of ""Unproven."""

She was a recent graduate of the Korbel School, a Research Fellow and an Assistant Director at the Human Trafficking Center, and had moved to Haiti to teach and start an NGO. Monica was a scholar-activist committed to serving the dispossessed and a clear and critical voice in the human trafficking field. She was also a dear friend and colleague to many of us.I will post the time and date of a memorial service soon.--Prof. Claude d'Estree:The location of Petersen's death (Haiti) and the scope of her work (human trafficking) seemingly added fuel to the prominent conspiracy theory that the Clintons have been quietly killing off their political foes for the last three decades. That conspiracy was then tied into criticisms of the Clinton Foundations' work in Haiti (which, whatever its flaws, has never been credibly linked to a child sex trafficking ring).Still, Petersen's death was presented as the ""smoking gun"" that connected everything together. A thread on the r/the_donald section of Reddit collected the ""evidence"" in an attempt to prove that Clinton was responsible for Peterson's death, including a link to a blog post critical of the Clinton Foundation which Petersen reportedly shared on Facebook (a screenshot of the message shows that it wasn't actually posted by her, but rather it was attributed to her), an alleged message from one of Petersen's friends claiming that she died of suicide, and a Facebook message Petersen allegedly wrote (again, a screenshot of the message shows that it wasn't actually shared by Petersen, but was attributed to her) stating that ""Hillary Clinton is just as bad as Donald Trump."":Although the purported Facebook friend stated that Petersen died of a suicide, an official cause of death has not been announced as of this writing.Monica Petersen may have been critical of the Clinton Foundation's work in Haiti (although the evidence presented comes from secondary sources and not from Petersen herself), but there's no evidence linking the Clintons to her death.:On Nov. 18, several people took to Facebook to ask the Human Trafficking Center if Petersen had been killed by the Clintons. The organization has deleted most of those messages, but they did respond to at least one by saying that such messages should be ignored because giving their posters attention ""will only feed the flames of their craziness"":  On Dec. 6, Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler reported that Claude d'Estree, the executive director of the Human Trafficking Center, had confirmed that Petersen committed suicide in Haiti. ""D'Estree said Petersen had gone to Haiti a number of times, but she was not there to research human trafficking and was not investigating the Clinton Foundation,"" Kessler wrote.:In sum, although no details of the circumstances of Petersen's death (apart from its being self-inflicted) have been made public, there is zero evidence linking the Clintons or Clinton Foundation to sex trafficking, or to Peterson's suicide. We therefore rate this rumor ""False.""  "
173,173,532.DidPennsylvaniaRecor,"Claim:The state of Pennsylvania recorded ""205,000 votes more than they had voters"" in the 2020 U.S. election.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Fact CheckAmong the copious false claims about election fraud that U.S. President Donald Trump made after losing the 2020 presidential election to challenger Joe Biden was the assertion that the state of Pennsylvania had found they recorded ""205,000 votes more than they had voters"":::The apparent source of the misinformation amplified by Trump was a news release issued by Pennsylvania State Rep. Frank Ryan on Dec. 28, maintaining that a comparison of ""county election results to the total number of voters who voted"" in Pennsylvania revealed a discrepancy of over 203,000 ballots:A comparison of official county election results to the total number of voters who voted on November 3, 2020 as recorded by the Department of State shows that 6,962,607 total ballots were reported as being cast, while DoS/SURE system records indicate that only 6,760,230 total voters actually voted. Among the 6,962,607 total ballots cast, 6,931,060 total votes were counted in the presidential race, including all three candidates on the ballot and write-in candidates.The difference of 202,377 more votes cast than voters voting, together with the 31,547 over- and under-votes in the presidential race, adds up to an alarming discrepancy of 170,830 votes, which is more than twice the reported statewide difference between the two major candidates for President of the United States.However, the Pennsylvania Department of State (DoS) issued a statement noting that the numbers obtained from the Statewide Uniform Registry of Electors (SURE) system by Ryan were not accurate because they were based on incomplete data. As the DoS observed, ""a few counties have not completed uploading their vote histories,"" and that those as-yet-unreported numbers ""would account for a significant number of voters""::In today's release Rep. Ryan and others rehash, with the same lack of evidence and the same absence of supporting documentation, repeatedly debunked conspiracy theories regarding the November 3 election. State and federal judges have sifted through hundreds of pages of unsubstantiated and false allegations and found no evidence of fraud or illegal voting.Now, the legislators have given us another perfect example of the dangers of uninformed, lay analysis combined with a basic lack of election administration knowledge.For instance, it is quite common to have significant ""undervotes"" for down-ballot races in a presidential election, particularly when there isn't a U.S. Senate race on the ballot. In 2000, Sen. Santorum received 200,000 more votes than President Bush, but the US Senate race still had more than 100,000 fewer votes than the presidential race.We are unclear as to what data the legislators used for this most recent ""analysis."" But the only way to determine the number of voters who voted in November from the SURE system is through the vote histories. At this time, there are still a few counties that have not completed uploading their vote histories to the SURE system. These counties, which include Philadelphia, Allegheny, Butler and Cambria, would account for a significant number of voters. The numbers certified by the counties, not the uploading of voter histories into the SURE system, determines the ultimate certification of an election by the secretary.:This obvious misinformation put forth by Rep. Ryan and others is the hallmark of so many of the claims made about this year's presidential election. When exposed to even the simplest examination, courts at every level have found these and similar conspiratorial claims to be wholly without basis.To put it simply, this so-called analysis was based on incomplete data.According to the final tally released by the DoS, a total of 6.96 million Pennsylvania voters actually voted in the 2020 election, amounting to 76.5% of registered voters.

174,174,475.BannedOldFlag,"On 23 June 2015, Amazon.com announced a controversial decision to discontinue the sale of Confederate flags and related merchandise. Almost immediately, rumors began to circulate about Amazon's decision, such as one suggesting the site evidenced a double standard by continuing to sell Islamic State (ISIS) flags.On 25 June 2015, the conspiracy-oriented site InfoWars published an article titled ""Amazon Staff: Government Ordered Us Not to Sell Confederate Flag."" Subtitled ""Company sales reps say they were 'instructed' by feds to ban rebel flag,"" the article did not cite any relevant law, but claimed that an Amazon.com chat representative had inadvertently admitted a more ""sinister"" impetus behind the online retailer's decision to discontinue the sale of Confederate flags:At first the Amazon staffer claims that the items were banned because they were deemed to be offensive, but when pressed by the customer, the sales rep tells a different story.""Is this a political statement by Amazon.com or is this a directive that you're following, that the government said you know we want you guys not to sell these anymore?"" asks the caller.""The government is not allowing us to sell this Confederate flag,"" responds the staffer""So the government is not allowing you....to sell it?"" asks the caller, to which the sales rep responds, ""yes.""""So Amazon is not making a political statement, this is something the government told you to do?"" questions the caller.""Exactly,"" responds the staffer.:  The article also featured a video uploaded to YouTube on 24 June 2015:https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=52&v=2OAZ5geZUU4The rumors led to a flurry of social media posts published by users outraged by the government's purported role in Amazon.com's decision to dump Confederate flag-related memorabilia::In an attempt to replicate the claims made in the InfoWars article, we initiated a customer service chat with Amazon on 25 June 2015. The Amazon representative insisted upon confirming our e-mail address (a standard first step in Amazon customer service), and our ensuing chat was markedly different than the version offered by InfoWars::  After confirming my identity, the second customer service representative said to me:Thank you so much for staying connected. I do understand your concern Kim, I would like to inform you that this item is currently taken out of our website for further research, I apologise for this however I can take a feed back on this to get it back on our website soon and trust me this will get back on our website soon.  We tried again, to see if the answer would change:Can you tell me why the Confederate flag is no longer available on Amazon.com?  The rep replied:Yes. We have taken it out for further research and I'm sorry I do not have the information on this, however I know that our internal teams are working on this.:  Based on that customer service chat interaction with Amazon.com, a few aspects of the InfoWars claim became suspect. The first rep to whom we were connected admitted that he or she was not a United States citizen or resident and did not even understand the question posed. The second was likely not a U.S. resident either (""Amreen"" being an uncommon name in the U.S.) and provided an answer that suggested he or she similarly was unaware of the nature of the item referenced, much less why we were unable to locate it on Amazon.com.The source of the screenshots cited in InfoWars' article was not disclosed, but the video of a separate interaction (embedded above) provided significant context about the purported admission from Amazon.com reps. More than three minutes into the clip, the ""customer"" on the line with Amazon persisted in badgering the representative before he began insinuating he would cancel his account (a metric upon which the representative is very likely measured at work).After a series of cancellation-related hints and remarks, the man directly tells the Amazon rep he would be willing to retain his account if she would say that Amazon made the decision under pressure by the government. The coerced sales rep hastily agreed in what clearly was an answer formulated to discourage the customer from canceling his account on the spot. It's unambiguous that the representative (who had been berated for several minutes up to that point) did not offer up the suggestion herself, and her agreement with the caller seemed entirely borne of his increasing frustration and anger.:Regardless, rumors of Confederate flag sales bans are firmly in the realm of conspiracy theory, as Amazon.com announced its decision to stop selling Confederate flag merchandise on 23 June 2015, but no new federal law or guideline had been passed or promoted to evidence government involvement. Therefore, the rumor suggested that Amazon had been targeted by a secret law or other covert pressure applied by shadowy government operatives.In the absence of sweeping federal action actually banning the Confederate flag (or changes to laws permitting individual Americans the right to display it), there's no reason to believe Amazon's decision was anything other than business-related. Moreover, available information suggests that such claims have been exaggerated and misrepresented (if not outright fabricated), as seen in the video above. If InfoWar's documenting screenshots (of unknown origin) were genuine, the response they captured was likely the product of the confusion (or harassment) of a single Amazon.com representative and not a true expression of Amazon corporate policy.UPDATE: On 25 June 2015, Amazon.com replied to our query about this rumor. A representative for the retailer said: :We can confirm that Amazon acted independently to remove Confederate flag merchandise."

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. :On July 27, 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) held a press briefing in which the agency announced it had reversed its previous mask recommendations in response to an uptick in nationwide COVID-19 infections and the spread of the delta variant.Following the announcement, the pseudoscience conspiracy theory website Natural News reported on July 29 that the health agency not only changed its stance of wearing masks but that it had also stated that vaccines were ""failing"" and that vaccinated individuals were considered ""superspreaders."" Natural News quoted a ""confession"" it claimed CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky publicly stated, describing vaccines as failing and that ""vaccinated people may now carry higher viral loads than unvaccinated people"":In making these public statements, the CDC just admitted that the entire promise that vaccinated people were immune to covid and couldn't spread it to others just unraveled. Immediately, the CDC demanded that the entire nation reverts to neanderthal mask mandates, even for those who have been ""fully vaccinated."":Similar claims were also made by radio personality Stew Peters on the video platform Rumble, in an interview summarized on his Rumble page as follows: ""Dr. Jane Ruby joined Stew Peters to reveal that the ""Delta Variant"" may not be the killer, but that the 'vaccines' are likely causing the trauma being treated at hospitals.""Having encountered these allegations, Snopes readers sent us the following screenshots to determine whether certain claims made by the reporters were accurate::Snopes listened to the 28-minute press briefing in its entirety and found that there was no truth to the above-quoted claims made by Natural News. (The audio recording is available via the CDC website. We have also listed the full statement issued by CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky at the bottom of this article.)The CDC did not say that vaccines were failing. In fact, the agency stated that had more Americans been vaccinated, there would not be a surge in cases.""As CDC has recommended for months, unvaccinated individuals should get vaccinated and continue masking until they are fully vaccinated in areas with substantial and high transmission,"" said Walensky.At no point during the press briefing did Walensky say that vaccinated individuals were ""superspreaders."" Vaccinated individuals, she said, continued to represent a very small amount of transmission occurring throughout the nation.""We continue to estimate that the risk of a breakthrough infection with symptoms upon exposure to the Delta variant is reduced by sevenfold. The reduction is 20-fold for hospitalizations and death,"" she added.:As such, we rate this claim ""False.""However, it is important to note that scientific evidence suggests that vaccinated people can carry as much virus as others in what has become known as so-called breakthrough infections, particularly in response to infection by the more dangerous delta variant. Walensky outlined these concerns and the CDC's response to them in her introductory statement, which Snopes transcribed below:As you have heard from me previously, this pandemic continues to pose a serious threat to the health of all Americans. I have said throughout my tenure at CDC that our guidance and recommendations will follow the science in our efforts to protect the health of as many Americans as possible and today we have new science related with adults a variant that requires us to update the guidance regarding what you can do when you are fully vaccinated.Delta variant is showing everyday its willingness to outsmart us and to be an opportunist in areas where we have not shown a fortified response against it. This week our data shows that delta remains the predominant variant circulating in the United States. Eight out of ten sequence samples contain the delta variant.:In recent days, I have seen new scientific data from recent outbreak investigations showing that the delta variant behaves uniquely differently from past strains of the virus that causes COVID-19. Information on the delta variant from several states and other countries indicates that in rare occasions, some vaccinated people infected with a delta variant after vaccination may be contagious and spread the virus to others. This new science is worrisome and unfortunately warrants an update to our recommendations.First, we continue to strongly encourage everyone to get vaccinated. Getting vaccinated continues to prevent severe illness, hospitalization, and death even with delta. It also helps reduce the spread of the virus in our communities. Vaccinated individuals continue to represent a very small amount of transmission occurring around the country. We continue to estimate that the risk of a breakthrough infection with symptoms upon exposure to the delta variant is reduced by sevenfold. The reduction is 20-fold for hospitalizations and death.As CDC has recommended for months, unvaccinated individuals should get vaccinated and continue masking until they are fully vaccinated in areas with substantial and high transmission.:CDC recommends fully vaccinated people wear masks in public indoor settings to help prevent the spread of the delta variant and protect others. This includes school.CDC recommends that everyone in K through 12 schools wear a mask indoors, including teachers, staff, students, and visitors regardless of vaccination status. Children should return to full time in person learning in the fall with proper prevention strategies in place.Finally, CDC recommends community leaders encourage vaccination and universal masking to prevent further outbreaks in areas of substantial and high transmission with the delta variant. Vaccinating more Americans now is more urgent than ever. The highest spread of cases and severe outcomes is happening in places with low vaccination rates and among unvaccinated people.This moment and, most importantly, the associated illness, suffering and death could have been avoided with higher vaccination coverage in this country. COVID-19 continues to present many challenges and has exacted a tremendous toll on our nation. We continue to follow the signs closely and update the guidance should the science shift again. We must take every step we can to stop the delta variant and end this pandemic.:"

What's FalseGutierrez began preparing to leave his seat before the patriotic chanting began, and says he exited the chamber in order to make it to a television interview on time. Gutierrez left as Trump was coming to the conclusion of what had been an historically long State of the Union address. :During his 2018 State of the Union address, as Donald Trump talked about monuments -- to freedom, to historical figures, and to veterans -- Republicans started chanting ""USA!"" As they did so, about three minutes before the end of the speech, Democratic Congressman Luis Gutierrez gathered up his things and walked out of the room -- a move that has put him at the center of a storm of outrage. Fox News, in a piece headlined ""Democrat Luis Gutierrez Storms Out of State of the Union During 'USA' Chant"" said:Rep. Luis Gutierrez turned and left the State of the Union address Tuesday, just as Republicans broke into a ""USA"" chant. President Donald Trump had just finished mentioning the Statue of Freedom atop the Capitol building, which he then called a ""monument to the American people.""In that section of remarks, Trump also praised veterans in wars from the Revolution, through World War II and today, mentioning sites like Saratoga, N.Y., Yorktown, V.A. and the Pacific theater.As half of the gallery broke into a ""USA"" chant, Gutierrez (D-Ill.) could be seen exiting his aisle seat and walking out of the chamber.:Paul Joseph Watson, editor-at-large of the conspiracy theory web site Infowars claimed Gutierrez left because he was ""triggered"" by the chanting. Speaking to Fox News, Deputy White House Press Secretary J. Hogan Gidley responded to the Congressman's early departure from the speech, saying ""For the life of me I can't figure out when Democrats became so...anti-this country.""In reality, Gutierrez has dismissed these claims, saying he left the chamber in order to make it to a television interview on time, adding that he deliberately waited until the president had stopped speaking before leaving his seat.There is a story going around that I ""stormed out"" of the President's speech last night which is completely false.

177,177,521.DidHillaryClintonGiv,"Claim:Sec. of State Hillary Clinton's approval of a deal to transfer control of 20% of U.S. uranium deposits to a Russian company was a quid pro quo exchange for donations to the Clinton Foundation.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In the months leading up to the 2016 United States presidential election, stories abounded about the relationships between the Clinton Foundation and various foreign entities.:May 2015 saw the publication of a book called Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich, an expose of alleged Clinton Foundation corruption written by Peter Schweizer, a former Hoover Institution fellow and editor-at-large at the right-wing media company Breitbart.A chapter in the book suggests that the Clinton family and Russia each may have benefited from a ""pay-for-play"" scheme while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, involving the transfer of U.S. uranium reserves to the new Russian owners of an international mining operation in exchange for $145 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation.:The mining company, Uranium One, was originally based in South Africa, but merged in 2007 with Canada-based UrAsia Energy. Shareholders there retained a controlling interest until 2010, when Russia's nuclear agency, Rosatom, completed purchase of a 51% stake. Hillary Clinton played a part in the transaction insofar as it involved the transfer of ownership of a material deemed important to national security -- uranium, amounting to one-fifth of U.S. reserves (a fraction re-estimated by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) at closer to one-tenth of the United States' uranium production capacity in 2017) -- thus requiring the approval of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), on which the U.S. Secretary of State sits.During the same time frame that the acquisition took place, the Clinton Foundation accepted contributions from nine individuals associated with Uranium One totaling more than $100 million, Schweizer claimed in Clinton Cash. Among those who followed Schweizer in citing the transaction as an instance of alleged Clinton corruption was GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, who said during a June 2016 speech in New York City::Hillary Clinton's State Department approved the transfer of 20% of America's uranium holdings to Russia, while nine investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.Trump's campaign repeated the allegation in a September 2016 press release, and again in an October 2016 television ad stating that Clinton ""gave American uranium rights to the Russians""::An image circulating via social media during the final months of the presidential campaign asked the question, ""So Hillary, if Russia is such a threat, why did you sell them 20% of our uranium? Are you a liar, or a traitor, or both?"":The Uranium One Deal Was Not Clinton's to Veto or Approve Among the ways these accusations stray from the facts is in attributing a power of veto or approval to Secretary Clinton that she simply did not have. Clinton was one of nine cabinet members and department heads that sit on the CFIUS, and the secretary of the treasury is its chairperson. CFIUS members are collectively charged with evaluating proposed foreign acquisitions for potential national security issues, then turning their findings over to the president. By law, the committee can't veto a transaction; only the president can. All nine federal agencies were required to approve the Uranium One transaction before it could go forward. According to The New York Times, Clinton may not have even directly participated in the decision. Then-Assistant Secretary of State Jose Fernandez, whose job it was to represent the State Dept. on CFIUS, said Clinton ""never intervened"" in committee matters. Clinton herself has said she wasn't personally involved.There Is No Evidence That Uranium Went to Russia:That a change of company ownership occurred doesn't mean that 10 to 20 percent of America's uranium literally went to Russia. Neither Uranium One nor ARMZ (Rosatom's mining subsidiary) is licensed to export uranium from the U.S. to other countries.Some exports did occur, however.A 2015 letter from NRC official Mark Satorius to a member of Congress revealed that an unspecified amount of yellowcake (semi-processed) uranium was shipped from a Uranium One facility in Wyoming to Canada between 2012 and 2014 for conversion (additional processing to prepare it for enrichment). A portion of that uranium was subsequently shipped to enrichment plants in Europe.The transfers to Canada were legal despite Uranium One's not holding an export license because the NRC granted such a license to the company that transported it. The transfers to Europe were legal because they were approved by another agency, the U.S. Dept. of Energy. Satorius stressed that the transfers were subject to NRC oversight and all applicable safety and national security regulations::Before issuing this license amendment to RSB Logistics Services -- or any other export license or license amendment -- the NRC must determine that the proposed export is not inimical to the common defense and security of the United States. Under existing NRC regulations, this means that any uranium proposed to be exported to any country for use in nuclear fuel would be subject to the Atomic Energy Act Section 123 agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation between the U.S. and that other country and confirmed in case-specific, government-to government assurances for each export license. The receiving country is required to commit to use the material only for peaceful purposes (not for development of any nuclear explosive device), to maintain adequate physical protection, and not to retransfer the material to a third country or alter it in form or content without the prior consent of the U.S. The transfer of the U.S.-supplied uranium from Canada to Europe noted above also was subject to applicable Section 123 agreements.Additionally, a small amount of that exported uranium was, in fact, sold to other countries. According to a 2 November 2017 article in The Hill, Uranium One officials acknowledged that approximately 25 percent of the yellowcake exported for conversion was subsequently sold via ""book transfer"" to customers in Western Europe and Asia (yellowcake being a fungible commodity, that doesn't necessarily translate to a physical transfer of the product, however).:To date, there is no evidence that any of this uranium made its way to Russia. An NRC spokesman cited by FactCheck.org in October 2017 reaffirmed Satorius's assurances that ""the U.S. government has not authorized any country to re-transfer U.S. uranium to Russia."" NRC officials also say they're unaware of any Uranium One exports from the U.S. to foreign countries since 2014.The Timing of Most of the Clinton Foundation Donations Does Not Match Of the $145 million allegedly contributed to the Clinton Foundation by Uranium One investors, the lion's share -- $131.3 million -- came from a single donor, Frank Giustra, the company's Canadian founder. But Giustra sold off his entire stake in the company in 2007, three years before the Russia deal and at least 18 months before Clinton became secretary of state. Of the remaining individuals connected with Uranium One who donated to the Clinton Foundation, only one was found to have contributed during the same time frame that the deal was taking place, according to The New York Times -- Ian Telfer (also a Canadian), the company's chairman::His donations through the Fernwood Foundation included $1 million reported in 2009, the year his company appealed to the American Embassy to help it keep its mines in Kazakhstan; $250,000 in 2010, the year the Russians sought majority control; as well as $600,000 in 2011 and $500,000 in 2012. Mr. Telfer said that his donations had nothing to do with his business dealings, and that he had never discussed Uranium One with Mr. or Mrs. Clinton. He said he had given the money because he wanted to support Mr. Giustra's charitable endeavors with Mr. Clinton. ""Frank and I have been friends and business partners for almost 20 years,"" he said. In addition to the Clinton Foundation donations, the New York Times also cited a $500,000 speaking fee paid to former president Bill Clinton by a Russian investment bank in June 2010, before the Uranium One deal was approved:The $500,000 fee -- among Mr. Clinton's highest -- was paid by Renaissance Capital, a Russian investment bank with ties to the Kremlin that has invited world leaders, including Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, to speak at its investor conferences.Renaissance Capital analysts talked up Uranium One's stock, assigning it a ""buy"" rating and saying in a July 2010 research report that it was ""the best play"" in the uranium markets.:The timing of Telfer's Clinton Foundation donations and Bill Clinton's Renaissance Capital speaking fee might be questionable if there was reason to believe that Hillary Clinton was instrumental in the approval of the deal with Russia, but all the evidence points to the contrary -- that Clinton did not play a pivotal role, and, in fact, may not have played any role at all. Moreover, neither Clinton nor her department possessed sole power of approval over said transaction.Foundation Admits to Disclosure Mistakes One fault investigations into the Clinton Foundation's practices did find was that not all of the donations were properly disclosed -- specifically, those of Uranium One Chairman Ian Telfer between 2009 and 2012. The foundation admitted this shortcoming and pledged to correct it, but as the Guardian pointed out in its May 2015 discussion of Clinton Cash, the fact that it happened is reason enough to sound alarm bells:It is also true that large donations to the foundation from the chairman of Uranium One, Ian Telfer, at around the time of the Russian purchase of the company and while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, were never disclosed to the public. The multimillion sums were channeled through a subsidiary of the Clinton Foundation, CGSCI, which did not reveal its individual donors.Such awkward collisions between Bill's fundraising activities and Hillary's public service have raised concerns not just among those who might be dismissed as part of a vast right-wing conspiracy.:An enormous volume of interest and speculation surrounds the workings of the Clinton Foundation, which is to be expected. Given the enormous sums of money it controls and the fact that it is run by a former U.S. president who is married to a former U.S. secretary of state and presidential candidate, the foundation deserves all the scrutiny it gets, and more.At the same time, for the sake of accuracy it's crucial to differentiate between partisan accusations and what we actually know about it -- however little that may be.UpdateOn 17 October 2017, The Hill reported obtaining evidence that Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official who oversaw the American operations of the Russian nuclear agency Rosatom, was being investigated for corruption by multiple U.S. agencies while the Uranium One deal was up for approval -- information that apparently was not shared with U.S. officials involved in approving the transaction. The Hill also reported receiving documents and eyewitness testimony ""indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton's charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow,"" although no specifics about who those Russian nuclear officials were or how the money was allegedly routed to the Clinton Foundation were given. In any case, none of these revelations prove that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton participated in a quid pro quo agreement to accept payment for approval of the Uranium One deal.:On 24 October 2017, the U.S. House intelligence and oversight committees announced the launch of a joint investigation into the circumstances surrounding the Russian purchase of Uranium One."
178,178,440.WhyHaveSoManyDailyCa,"When Scott Greer was writing stories for the conservative Daily Caller web site, he was also writing virulently racist articles under a pseudonym for Radix Journal, a web site founded by white supremacist Richard Spencer.Daily Caller editor-in-chief Geoffrey Ingersoll told us in an email that he didn't know about Greer's racist moonlighting gig and that if he had, he would have fired Greer. But this instance wasn't the first time the Daily Caller seemingly cut ties with a writer only after another publication had highlighted their white supremacist views.On 5 September 2018 The Atlantic reported that chat logs revealed Greer wrote under the name Michael McGregor on Spencer's web site. His posts disparaged African-Americans, Jewish people, and women. In 2015 he responded to the police custody-related death of Freddie Gray, a black Baltimore man, by writing on Radix that:Cops are now the preferred scapegoats for the sole reason that they are the symbols of a justice system Blacks hate, a justice system Blacks want undermined for their benefit. However, this justice system has to be harsh on Blacks in order to preserve stability and a measure of safety in a multiracial state. The current campaign against tough policing, if successful, would effectively turn any city with a large percentage of Blacks into a third world hellhole.:The Atlantic also reported that:[Greer's] posts sometimes showcased anti-Semitic views as well. In a post about a 2015 cover story in The Atlantic about European Jews written by the magazine's current editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, Greer sneeringly (and with incorrect grammar) used Hebrew words and wrote that Jews were responsible for the anti-Semitism they face in Europe due to ""the Jewish role in promoting the root causes of this problem through their support of mass immigration, multiculturalism, and hate speech laws that only go after Whites"" ...Greer also wrote about sexual politics, the religious right, and abortion; in a September 2014 post about a sexual-consent law in California, he wrote that ""while sex laws become more draconian for White men and they are further assaulted for trying to be men, the more virile Arabs, Blacks, and Hispanics that are swarming into our countries will continue to victimize our people."" In June 2014 he wrote that Christian Zionists' ""worship of Jews borders on fetishization and naturally incites hatred for the root cultures of European peoples."" In March 2014, he wrote that pro-life movements ""are not pro-life in any way, shape or form. They have a sick obsession with seeing any type of 'human being' that is capable of shitting being preserved -- no matter what the cost."" In another September 2014 post, he wrote that gender equality ""will make women more determined to pursue ambitions that will make them miserable, turn men into eunuchs, and allow for the continuing growth of non-White hordes in formerly White countries."":We asked Ingersoll when he was made aware of Greer's Radix affiliation and what he would do to prevent further publishing of content authored by white supremacists on the Daily Caller. Ingersoll responded by saying he was ""insulted"" by our questions and that he would have ""fired Scott Greer instantly if I ever knew about his posting to that website."" He also maintained that he has ""rebuilt the process for vetting opinion contributors and for vetting news contributors,"" but he did not provide specifics nor did he explain how Greer slipped through the cracks in the first place.Ingersoll expressed concern that this reporter ""might have suffered a series of severe blows to the head and are in need of immediate medical attention. Please, stop what you are doing right now and get a CAT scan."" Emails sent to the Daily Caller's executive editor Paul Conner, public affairs director Margaret Crilley and chief operating officer Brian Danza were not returned.Although Ingersoll claimed ignorance to Greer's views, Greer didn't make a secret of them. In August 2017, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) reported that Greer associated with hardcore white nationalists including Devin Saucier and Marcus Epstein, posing for photographs with them that were posted to Facebook. In one photograph, Greer can be seen wearing a t-shirt from the Youth for Western Civilization (YWC), a now-defunct white nationalist student group.:In a statement to The Atlantic, co-founder and publisher Neil Patel admitted he was aware of the allegations in the SPLC report but didn't take action at the time because he believed the organization to have a history of ""unfair attacks"" and Greer had denied the accusations. ""We had two choices,"" Patel told the The Atlantic. ""Fire a young man because of some photos taken of him at metal shows in college, or take his word. We chose to trust him.""The day after President Donald Trump was elected in November 2016, Greer declared that ""As a white man, I finally now feel safe in America"" on his verified Twitter account:As a white man, I finally now feel safe in America-- Scott Greer (@ScottMGreer) November 9, 2016In May of that year, Greer wrote a post for the Daily Caller likening calls by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to remove a Confederate monument with Islamic State tactics.:Ingersoll's response to us reflected that of Daily Caller co-founder Tucker Carlson's belligerent tirade directed at Washington Post reporter Erik Wemple, who also asked about whether Carlson, now a Fox News prime time host, knew of Greer's background when he was hired:I asked Tucker Carlson if he knew about Scott Greer's racist tracts exposed by @RosieGray. His response below. https://t.co/e4maQKDDmo pic.twitter.com/FlV1GsF4iL-- ErikWemple (@ErikWemple) September 5, 2018This is not the first time a white supremacist has been exposed while writing for the Daily Caller. In May 2017, ProPublica revealed that Jason Kessler had authored a piece about a white supremacist protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, but neither Kessler nor the Daily Caller disclosed that Kessler was in fact involved with organizing that very protest, and that he had given a speech ""in which he praised fascist and racist organizations, thanked a prominent Holocaust denier, and declared the beginnings of a cultural 'civil war.'"" Kessler went on to organize the deadly ""Unite the Right"" white supremacist rally in Charlottesville in August 2017 during which a counter-protester was murdered.:Ingersoll acknowledged in a series of Twitter posts in July 2018 that Kessler was paid per click for the stories he wrote. Ingersoll also acknowledged that he personally scrubbed Kessler's bylines from the Daily Caller's site but offered no explanation for that action to readers.In March 2017, a former editor for the site posted a tweet in which she joked about running over Native American demonstrators who were protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline. In September 2017, the Daily Caller posted, then deleted, a video of Jewish New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush saying the word ""chutzpah"" with the well-known folk song ""Hava Nagila"" playing in the background. That same month, Wemple reported that another Daily Caller writer, Chuck Ross, had maintained a now-defunct blog until 2010 in which he wrote at length about his belief that black people were inferior.Here is a list of Daily Caller writers who have so far been revealed to have expressed racist views:Scott Greer:Greer spent his time at the Daily Caller writing about immigration and the alt right, along with pieces that painted Native Americans as violent cannibals, blaming black people for the racial disparity in police shootings (referring to slain 12-year-old Tamir Rice as a ""large male"") and providing a sympathetic platform to a man fired from his job for turning up at Confederate monument rally in New Orleans decked out in a helmet and shield. According to The Atlantic, Greer started working at the Daily Caller in 2014, while his pseudonym ""Michael McGregor"" was listed as the managing editor of Radix.Jason KesslerThe ""Unite the Right"" organizer wrote three articles for the Daily Caller, including one published on 14 May 2017 that promoted a rally lead by white supremacist Richard Spencer. He penned at least two other stories for the web site, in one of which he interviewed Kyle Chapman, a 41-year-old man known online as ""Based Stickman"" for swinging a stick at opponents during demonstrations. A third story outlined the gruesome murder of a 17-year-old boy by MS-13 gang members. After a white supremacist drove his car into a crowd at Kessler's ""Unite the Right"" rally on 12 August 2017 and killed a woman, the Daily Caller deleted Kessler's articles.:Peter BrimelowBrimelow runs the white supremacist web site VDare.com. In March 2017, he wrote a column for the Daily Caller in which he argued that the United States ""was to be a nation-state, the political expression of a particular (white, British) people, as in Europe."" As RationalWiki noted, ""[VDare.com] appears to be mainly a platform for Peter Brimelow's anti-immigration views, which veer frequently into playing footsie with overt white nationalism; the other topics are window dressing. Brimelow has admitted that VDARE does publish people who are white nationalists."" In August 2018, White House speechwriter Darren Beattie was fired for appearing alongside Brimelow at a conference.Moses ApostaticusMoses Apostaticus is the rather august-sounding pen name of David Hilton, an anti-Semitic writer who has posted memes expressing the belief that Israel was behind the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center.

In a January 2017 Daily Caller piece, Hilton promoted another anti-Semitic conspiracy theory and accused billionaire philanthropist George Soros of deploying ""foot soldiers"" in his scheme to implement a ""globalist oligarchy."":"
179,179,568.WerePresidentTrumpsB,"Claim:President Trump's border wall project will necessarily result in a huge payout to powerful Russian oligarch and steel magnate Roman Abramovich due to specific requirements imposed by Trump. Rating:FalseAbout this rating In late January 2019, a chain message with the subject ""Why Does Trump Want This Wall So Badly?"" began to spread through inboxes, on social media, and on Reddit. The answer, according to an anonymous author, was that ""the steel slats Trump wants to use ... are manufactured in the U.S. by a steel mill co-owned by a Russian-Israeli billionaire named Roman Abramovich.""::Why Does Trump Want This Wall So Badly? Answer: Roman Abramovich. The steel slats Trump wants to use for his ""Wall of Shame"" are manufactured in the US by a steel mill co-owned by a Russian-Israeli billionaire named Roman Abramovich.No surprise, Abramovich is close friends with Trump and Putin. Trump chose 480 sq ft steel rails for his newest ""design"" because Abramovich's mills are the only ones capable of producing them. This also explains why Trump put a tariff on steel from other countries. He eliminated any and all competition, guaranteeing Abramovich the contract.The Wall is not about security. It's a smoke screen. It is a shady business deal between Trump and Russia. It is about MONEY. When Trump is involved, it is always about money. He's lining his pockets, and the pockets of our enemies, while selling out hardworking Americans and our country. It just cannot be any clearer.These three paragraphs blended factual statements about Abramovich with unverified assertions to create a narrative at odds with reality. For this narrative to be true, each of the following statements would need to be true::U.S. President Donald Trump specifically indicated he wanted to build his border wall using ""480 square foot steel rails.""Abramovich owns the only mill in the United States capable of producing ""480 square foot steel rails"", thereby guaranteeing Abramovich the contract for the wall.Donald Trump is friends with Roman Abramovich.It is true that Abramovich is a well-connected Russian oligarch with some ties to the Trump family, and it is true that Abramovich owns the only mill in the United States capable of producing 480-foot, steel rails (a product touted for its utility in the train industry). However, President Trump, who has changed his view multiple times on what his wall should look like, has not once made ""480-foot steel rails"" an immutable part of that plan. This conspiracy theory hinges primarily on that final false assertion.Who Is Roman Abramovich, And Is He Close with President Trump?:Roman Abramovich is a Russian-Israeli billionaire who, among other things, owns the Chelsea Premier League football club and is also the largest shareholder of the multinational, Russian-based steel company Evraz. After being granted Israeli citizenship in May 2018, Abramovich became the world's richest Israeli. He is identified as a Russian oligarch (based on his ""closeness to the Russian regime and ... net worth"") and appears on a U.S. Treasury list produced as part of sanctions legislation President Trump reluctantly signed into law. Abramovich's presence on this list does not necessarily mean he is subject to U.S. sanctions, though.Abramovich is friendly with the Trump family, mainly through his wife, Dasha Zhukova. In 2014, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner spent four days in Russia at the invitation of Zhukova, where ""they sat at the same table along with a few other people during a high-powered fundraising dinner for Moscow's Jewish Museum,"" according to Bloomberg. Jared Kushner, Bloomberg reported, had also been invested in an art business whose founding partner was Zhukova, and ""Ivanka Trump, Kushner and his brother, Joshua, have accompanied Zhukova to sporting events in the New York area."" Zhukova, a Politico reporter noted, attended the Trump inauguration as a guest of Ivanka Trump.:Abramovich's steel background has inspired past speculation about possible quid-pro-quos between the Trump administration and Russia, and it is likely that this current Abramovich-border wall theory rests on the speculation caused by Abramovich's factual involvement in the Keystone XL pipeline.On 24 January 2017, just days into his presidency, President Trump signed two executive orders: the first order reversed President Obama's decision to revoke a permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline, and the second order mandated that, ""to the maximum extent permitted by law,"" the pipeline be made with steel ""produced in the United States.""Evraz had already produced 40% of the steel for the existing sections of Keystone XL, the climate-focused DeSmog Blog reported, and Terry Cunha, a spokesperson for TransCanada, which is behind Keystone XL project, acknowledged to DeSmog that Evraz stood to benefit if construction resumed on the pipeline. Critics argued that the language in the ""manufactured in the USA"" executive order left significant room for Evraz to be the likely supplier of steel for Keystone XL should the project ever overcome its current legal hurdles, as Evraz operates three steel mills  in the United States.:What Does Any of This Have to Do with the Border Wall?Those friendly relations, Abramovich's influence over the global steel market, and previous Trump administration legislation beneficial to the oligarch's interests created a strong factual base on which to build a flimsy fictional narrative. There is no question that any form of a border wall, regardless of design, will involve large quantities of steel which could theoretically be produced by a U.S.-based, Evraz-owned steel mill. But the supposed ""smoking gun"" link in support of the notion that the steel it will have to produced by Evraz is that President Trump's latest wall machination supposedly requires the use of ""480 sq ft steel rails"" (which we interpret to mean ""480-foot-long steel rails"", as the latter is actually a real commodity).Such a requirement would certainly be provocative, as it does appear that one Evraz-owned steel mill in Colorado is the only such facility within the United States capable of producing that length of rail. The train industry is quite interested in these super-long rail lengths, as they reduce the amount of welding required for track construction or repairs. In November 2006, the Denver Post reported on Evraz's acquisition of the Colorado-based Rocky Mountain Steel company, stating that it would become the only American facility to produce those 480-foot-length rail sections::Portland-based Oregon Steel Mills Inc., owner of Rocky Mountain Steel Mills in Pueblo, [Colorado], announced it has agreed to be acquired by Russian steelmaker Evraz Group SA. ... The mill announced last week that it is considering building a new rail mill, which would be the first in the nation capable of making rails up to 480 feet long.The only problem? We have not identified a single instance of President Trump's stating a requirement that the border wall use 480-foot-length steel rails, nor have we found any rationale for why such a length would be efficacious in border wall construction. Trump's descriptions of his proposed border wall have shifted repeatedly since it was first raised as a talking point on 5 August 2014, and such descriptions have never been heavy on technical specifics. During most of the 2016 presidential campaign Trump described his barrier as a concrete wall, but in an about-face he said in late 2018 that the wall would be made with ""artistically designed steel slats,"" tweeting a rudimentary design of such a ""Steel Slat Barrier"" on 21 December 2018:A design of our Steel Slat Barrier which is totally effective while at the same time beautiful! pic.twitter.com/sGltXh0cu9-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 21, 2018:Using this schematic and some basic math, the Washington Post's Philip Bump calculated that the barrier proposed by President Trump in this version of his plans would be built using 28.4-feet-high by 10-inch-wide steel slats with 13-inch spikes on top, separated from each other by a 9-inch gap. None of this, to our ears, screams ""480 sq foot steel rails.""The notion that Trump and Abramovich are corruptly colluding to provide a massive contract for a Russian-based steel company via a steel southern border wall (whose existence, let alone design, has yet to be approved in Congress) appears to be unfounded speculation rooted in a manufacturing requirement for the wall that Trump never actually stated."

The remaining residents are 3rd and 4th generation American families who have been living on family land or settling the area in general for 250 years, but their rights don't matter[.]For starters, there is no suburb of Dearborn, Michigan called Blairsville, and the photograph used in the story to depict a supposed Christmas-banning Muslim cleric is actually an Associated Press photograph of Mohammad Qatanani, the leader of a mosque in New Jersey who has been in the news because he has been fighting potential deportation.It is clear from AsAmericanAsApplePie.org's ""About"" page that it is a satire site that is not meant to be taken literally::When no one can trust the lying fake news liberal media anymore because they hate us and guns and Harley Davidson and meat and OUR president, As American as Apple Pie is here to be your beacon of something you can kinda rely on sometimes but not really.Whether one thinks the content of the site is funny is subjective, but the post seems intended to play off anti-Muslim sentiments and ongoing fearmongering over an alleged ""war on Christmas"", which is recycled in one form or another every year despite a consistent lack of evidence to support its assertions.Predictably, despite the fact the story is satire and its details completely fictional, people posted it to social media with anti-Muslim commentary like this, for example:: "
181,181,527.FaceMaskRulesDoTheyR,"This article is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.Several hundred people assembled in London's Hyde Park in July 2020 to protest rules making face masks mandatory in shops and supermarkets to help control the spread of COVID-19. This was not an isolated event. Similar protests have occurred in many places around the world in reaction to the prospect of ""mask mandates"" - especially in the United States.These protesters are not without allies. ""Anti-maskers"" have elicited support from prominent figures on the political right in the UK and America: Peter Hitchens of the Daily Mail has called them ""muzzles""; Michael Savage, a prominent talk radio host, called masks a ""mark of submission""; to say nothing of President Donald Trump's refusal to wear a face mask in public and his dismissal of them as ""politically correct"" (until his abysmal approval ratings compelled him to awkwardly soften his position).:Why do mask mandates elicit such anger?Setting aside the conspiracy theories and disinformation that seem to prevade these protests, the participants are joined by a fierce attachment to individual liberty. They believe mask mandates sacrifice individual liberty to a collectivist notion a ""greater good"".It is easy to understand why: mask mandates use the coercive power of the state to require a person to do something that they would otherwise not choose to do. And it seems to follow that a person's liberty is compromised by such interference.The conception of ""freedom as non-interference"" that underpins the anti-mask movement has the virtue of simplicity. It allows us to apply an easy metric to test our freedom: if our choices are interfered with, then we are less free.But if this is correct it is unclear why wearing a mask is so troubling given the widespread ""interference"" in our other choices. Surely, the requirement that you have to cover any part of your body is a far graver violation of individual liberty than being compelled to wear a small face covering during a pandemic? It may be that the anti-mask movement is the spear tip of a global militant nudism trend, but that doesn't seem particularly plausible (or desirable).:What is freedom?The problem is that the idea of liberty as non-interference often runs up against common sense. For example, most people do not feel savagely oppressed by having to drive on one side of the road, by bans on public nudity or by laws against murder. They interfere with our choices, but they don't seem to make us less free. Maybe we need a different formulation of freedom.What's behind mask refusal?ShutterstockYou are free when you are protected not against simple interference, but against arbitrary interference.As the philosopher Philip Pettit notes, this makes liberty a more complex idea, but one better suited to our social reality. It is more vulnerable because it only requires the potential for interference to be compromised, but it also makes it more robust because if the interference is not arbitrary then it is not a violation of liberty even if our actions are constrained.:This can be illustrated by contrasting the slave with the citizen. All the choices of a slave are predicated on their master's permission. This is the case even if they have a kind or lazy owner who never actually interferes in their choices. The possibility of being ""sold down the river"" remains and being under such power is irreconcilable with freedom.In contrast a citizen may be subject to significant interference from the state, but it does not diminish their liberty if the laws are not arbitrary. This is true if several conditions exist: the laws need to be publicly known so that you can ensure compliance; they need to be impartially enforced so that no one is above the law; they need to be contestable in courts of law and the public square; and they need to be subjected to invigilation by those they affect, usually through democratic accountability.A slave has to live in a state of perpetual uncertainty, a citizen knows where they stand.This account of freedom depends on the procedural mechanisms which prevent the power of the state being chained to the private will of a single person or group. If ""mask mandates"" meet these procedural requirements, then they cannot be said to violate the personal liberty of individuals even if they restrict what they can and cannot do.:Let's test whether mask mandates meet these requirements. The rules are publicly known and they seem to be being impartially enforced, though there is an open question about whether COVID-19 restrictions have been applied unfairly to people of colour. If these mandates violate a citizen's rights, then they are free to bring a legal challenge and we know they can protest against them (so long as the protests comply with regulations). Finally, these rules are the product of democratically elected governments subject to judicial oversight and political opposition. They therefore cannot be called arbitrary. The anti-maskers are right that the state ought to be resisted when it tries to dominate its citizens and violate their basic rights, but instead of worrying about masks, they ought to be more concerned with instances of unidentifiable government agents firing tear gas into peaceful demonstrators or detaining people for an indeterminate amount of time under the nebulous mandate of protecting monuments or national security.

182,182,561.CouldWriteInBallotsf,"Claim:In Georgia's U.S. Senate runoff election on Jan. 5, 2021, a majority of write-in ballots for Trump would elect him to the U.S. Senate, or alternatively, undermine Republican candidates.Rating:MixtureAbout this rating What's TrueIf a majority of Republican voters marked their ballots with Trump's name and did not vote for Georgia's Republican U.S. Senate candidates, their Democratic challengers would win; therefore, the write-in protest would undermine Senate Republicans.What's FalseSince Georgia law only allows two candidates per race on ballots in runoffs, and since Trump was not one of them in the Jan. 5 election, he has no legal avenue to secure a Senate seat in this election. Additionally, there's no official space for write-in candidates in the runoffs, so ballots with Trump's name written on them would likely be considered invalid.:Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.In late November 2020, after U.S. President-elect Joe Biden secured the battleground state of Georgia in the presidential election, a social media campaign emerged claiming his opponent, U.S. President Donald Trump, would have a chance to serve in the U.S. Senate if enough people voted for him in the state's upcoming runoffs.The Jan. 5, 2021, runoff election between incumbent Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue and Democrats the Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff will decide whether Republicans or Democrats control the upper chamber at the outset of a Biden administration. Georgia election rules call for runoff races when no candidate exceeds 50% of voter share in either race during the general election. But with the hashtag #WriteInTrumpForGA on platforms including Twitter and Parler, an online haven for conservatives, posts attempted to convince Georgia voters to write in Trump's name and elect him to the Senate, even though he was not a candidate. :""We need to cover ALL bases in our stop the steal efforts, and one of these is simply utilizing our voice for the GA runoffs and writing in Donald J Trump for senate,"" read one Parler post. ""[We] can maintain a senate majority with TRUMP as the majority leader! We can put a STOP to the democrats!""The underlying message of some posts echoed Trump's attacks on Georgia Republican state officials who oversaw the process for certifying votes in the presidential race. In tweets and emails to supporters soliciting donations, the Trump campaign called on Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to break state laws governing the democratic process and defy the outcome of the popular vote that awarded Georgia's 16 electoral votes to Biden. He won by fewer than 13,000 votes out of about 5 million cast.Some Parler posts obtained by Snopes, such as the ones displayed below, lumped Senate candidates Loeffler and Perdue into that group of Republicans who were not acceding to the Trump campaign's requests to delegitimize Biden's win by spreading baseless allegations that Dominion Voting Systems software had altered votes.:""The president has basically taken hostage this race,"" said Brendan Buck, once a top adviser to former House Speaker Paul Ryan, per The Associated Press.In short, some posts wanted Georgia voters to write in Trump's name to supposedly help him win a Senate seat. Meanwhile, others promoted the #WriteInTrumpForGA campaign not to necessarily elect Trump but to ""punish"" Loeffler and Perdue, since participating voters would, in theory, otherwise have voted for the Senate Republican candidates.:The assumption behind the former approach -- that Trump had a realistic chance to serve in the Senate -- was false, but the latter reasoning had some validity to it, which we explain below.First, though, let us lay out laws governing runoff elections. Georgia is one of 10 U.S. states where statutes require runoff elections when no candidate receives more than 50% of votes in a general election. Per Georgia Code Title 21. Elections SS 21-2-501:""In instances where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, a run-off primary, special primary runoff, run-off election, or special election runoff between the candidates receiving the two highest numbers of votes shall be held.""That means, per state law, all runoffs in Georgia only allow two candidates (the top two vote-getters in general elections) per race on ballots. So in the Jan. 5 Georgia runoffs, ballots allow voters the options of selecting either Loeffler or Warnock in one race, or Perdue or Ossoff in the other (see the sample ballot below).:There is no line allocated for a write-in option, no matter if people cast paper ballots or use touch-screen voting. :An Attempt To 'Tilt The Balance In Trump's Favor'Nonetheless, people in theory could still answer the social media campaign's request to write in Trump's name on ballots unofficially, perhaps in the paper's margins or next to the Senate candidates' names.But that scribbling would not be an official vote for the sitting president (or anyone) for numerous reasons. Namely, as stated, Trump was not among the top two vote-getters in Georgia's Senate races, so the law does not consider him a viable candidate in the runoffs. Additionally, since the ballots do not include an official line for write-in candidates, writing outside of the bubbles for official candidates could force election officials to invalidate the paperwork all together, per laws governing the ballot-counting process. The statutes require poll workers to scan ballots for improper markings or other defects before they feed them into tabulation machines for official vote counts. As a result, spoiled or defective ballots are not legally counted in elections.:Given that fact, opponents of Trump co-opted #WriteInTrumpForGA in attempt to help Democratic Senate candidates in Georgia. If a significant number of Republican voters wrote Trump on their ballots -- and, as a result, election officials had to invalidate their votes under state law -- the race's Democratic candidates could reap the benefit, and Republicans could risk losing a Senate majority.That communications strategy to convince die-hard conservatives that voting for Loeffler and Perdue would defy Trump's political agenda (cryptically in the name of helping Democrats) manifested in other ways, too.:An anti-Trump political organization called ""Really American PAC"" was supposedly soliciting donations on ActBlue, a fundraising processor for Democratic campaigns, to pay for the billboards displayed below. At least one Twitter user claimed to have seen one of the signs in real life.""If Trump supporters deliver Perdue and Loeffler a victory, they should be acutely aware that they will be delivering Trump and MAGA a serious political defeat,"" read a statement by the PAC.:A website, writeintrumpforgeorgiasenate.com, was also part of that tongue-in-cheek campaign effort, per an attorney for an opposing political action group. The website read: :""With enough write-ins in the Georgia senate race, we can tilt the balance in Georgia in Trump's favor! If we can do this, we have a real chance at getting these RINO senators to act on the illegitimate and corrupt election presided over by a Democrat party that is invested in the Communist takeover of Our Great Nation. ""The site says it was funded by the political group ""Committee for American Sovereignty,"" which according to news reports was created in 2016 to help Republican operatives -- including Trump's longtime political confidant Roger Stone -- undermine Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign by spewing an unfounded conspiracy theory that Bill Clinton had an illegitimate biracial son.The Daily Beast, however, reported that Paul Jensen, an attorney for the committee, refuted its connection to the website, and alleged its ""goal is to elect the Democrat candidate, suggesting that a Democrat-leaning entity, not the Committee for American Sovereignty, is behind it.""Effects of Political Communication Schemes Remain Unknown:On Nov. 23, Donald Trump Jr. refuted the messages urging Trump supporters to abstain from voting for Loeffler and Perdue.:More than a week later, as Trump prepared for a Dec. 5 visit to Georgia to campaign alongside Perdue and Loeffler, the president echoed that sentiment, saying in a tweet ""we must work hard"" to ensure victories for the Republican Senate candidates.In sum, the outcome of the runoffs remained unknown; therefore, it was unclear how any ballots, much less those with invalid markings for Trump, would impact results.:But if, instead of voting for Loeffler or Perdue, a significant number of Republican voters unofficially wrote Trump's name on their ballots -- and, as a result, election officials had to throw out those ballots-- Democrats' vote margins would benefit. Depending on the level of participation in that protest, it could undermine Senate Republicans' chance at securing the chamber's majority.Nonetheless, state and federal laws governing elections would not allow voters the opportunity to elect Trump to the Senate in the runoffs. For those reasons, we rate this claim ""Mostly false."""

Kennedy ever since he was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, on 22 November 1963.:Central to nearly all those theories is the notion that Lee Harvey Oswald, who was judged to be a ""lone gunman"" by the Warren Commission, did not really act alone and in fact simply played the most visible role in a far-reaching conspiracy that may have included elements in the United States government itself.One bit of evidence regularly put forward in support of that notion is a statement Kennedy allegedly made seven days before he was killed.

That example featured slightly different wording from that of the later meme:""There exists in this country a plot to enslave every man woman and child. Before I leave this high and noble office, I intend to expose this plot."" - President John F. Kennedy -- 7 days before he was assassinated.We looked especially closely at the two speeches Kennedy gave on 15 November 1963, exactly seven days before his assassination, for anything resembling the statement ""There's a plot in this country to enslave every man, woman and child."" The first, delivered at an AFL-CIO convention in New York, dwelt primarily on economic concerns and contained no mentions of a conspiracy to be quashed.:The second, much shorter address he gave to the National Convention of the Catholic Youth Organization that day (also in New York City), made reference to an ""ideological gulf"" between democracy and its enemies (by which he presumably meant Communism), but again, Kennedy said nothing about a plot to enslave Americans.A search of our own message board archives uncovered an older, somewhat similar quote to """"There exists in this country a plot to enslave every man woman and child"" shared with Snopes.com a few weeks after the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001:""The high office of President has been used to foment a plot to destroy the American's freedom, and before I leave office I must inform the citizen of his plight."" -- John F. Kennedy at Columbia University, 10 days before his assassinationThere is also this slight variation, still circulating as of November 2018::If such a statement were made 10 days before the assassination, that would date it to 12 November 1963. However, according to an archived JFK Library post written in 2006, Kennedy did not speak at Columbia University on that or any other date in November 1963:Many references to this fictitious speech exist in assassination theorist material. Supposedly, the President was discussing changes in the Federal Reserve and the gold standard, and this topic was somehow linked to his assassination. Others also claim he said, ""The high office of President has been used to foment a plot to destroy American freedom, and before I leave office I must inform the citizen of his plight."" But the simple fact is that President John F. Kennedy did not speak at Columbia University in November of 1963.Those who believe in the ""fact"" of President Kennedy having made such a speech, either at Columbia or some other place, will simply deny this denial. At best, they will say that because ""all or most records"" have been destroyed, we simply don't know the truth; at worst, they will claim that there is a conspiracy to keep this issue silent. If someone chooses to believe in the existence of this speech, he or she does so as a matter of faith, which is fine, as long as that person realizes that it is religion and not history in which he or she is dealing.:Conspiracy mongers often resort to the claim that evidence could have been covered up or purposely destroyed, but when the subject matter is an utterance of a President of the United States -- and especially one attended by controversy -- eradicating every trace of it from the historical record would be well-nigh impossible."
186,186,634.ObamaOustsTopOfficer,"Claim:   President Obama fired several military officers for disobeying his order to destroy Charleston as part of a ""false flag"" attack.FALSEExample:   [Collected via e-mail, October 2013]Inquiring about a tactical nuke detonated underwater off the coast of SC during week ending 10-12-13.  Obamba fires several generals for not detonating it closer to Charleston.   A shocking new Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) report circulating in the Kremlin today states that President Barack Obama, while in a rage, ousted four of the United States top ranking military officers after they refused to detonate a nuclear device ""in/near"" Charleston, South Carolina this past week and, instead, exploded it off the Atlantic Coast.According to this report, Strategic Missile Forces Command (SMF) notified both President Putin and the General Staff this past Tuesday (8 October) that at 01:58:11 GMT/UTC an atomic device was exploded in the seabed off the US Atlantic Ocean, barely 1,000 km (620 miles) from Charleston, causing a 4.5 magnitude earthquake measurement that SMF experts equate to being a 1-kiloton yield, which is equal to the power of 1,000 tons of TNT.:   Origins:   This October 2013 article about President Obama supposedly firing ""four top ranking military officers"" after they refused to detonate a nuclear device ""in or near"" Charleston, South Carolina, isn't a real news item.  And neither is its follow-up which posited that Russia had successfully test-fired a ballistic missile in ""direct response to President Barack Obama's attempt to destroy Charleston"" as part of a ""false flag attack.""Both items are just more fictional ""Sorcha Faal"" sensationalism originating with a single disreputable source, the whatdoesitmean.com political conspiracy site, of which  RationalWiki says:Sorcha Faal is the alleged author of an ongoing series of ""reports"" published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don't think much of it. Each report resembles a news story in its style but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don't contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish.:In this case the actual news items from which the Sorcha Faal fantasy was spun were the mid-October 2013 announcements that Air Force Maj. Gen. Michael Carey and U.S. Vice Adm. Tim Giardina, both of whom oversaw the United States' arsenal of nuclear forces, had been relieved of their commands for ""personal misbehavior.""Previous examples of WhatDoesItMean nuttery include a May 2013 report that Russian President Vladimir Putin had threatened U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry with a world war over a ""bee apocalypse"" supposedly caused by American agricultural biotechnology corporations.  Unfortunately, other political conspiracy sites which have more professional-appearing names and layouts than whatdoesitmean.com, such as the European Union Times, republish the former's fantastic ""Sorcha Faal"" reports, creating the misleading impression that such material is being reported by multiple legitimate news sources.:As RationalWiki notes of the European Union Times:The European Union Times strays deeply into tinfoil hat territory. For example, it regularly re-publishes the hilarious ""reports"" of ""Sorcha Faal."" If you see a headline that is really ""out there"" (for example, ""US Earthquake Weapon Test Fails Again, Destroys New Zealand City""), scroll to the bottom and have a look at the ""Source"" link. If it points to whatdoesitmean.com, it's the handiwork of ""Sorcha"". The EUTimes has also re-published material from Pravda Online, another site dedicated to conspiracy theories, such as a 2010 article about alien spaceships attacking Earth in 2012.In March 2015, an audience member at the South Carolina National Security Action summit posed a rambling question to former senator Rick Santorum that included the claim that ""Obama tried to blow up a nuke in Charleston a few months ago"":Y'know, what's goin' on Senator Santorum.Where do we go from here? Ted told me I've got to wait now till the next election. I don't think the country will be around for the next election.Obama tried to blow up a nuke in Charleston a few months ago and the three Admirals and Generals. He has totally destroyed our military. He has fired all the Generals and all the Admirals who said they wouldn't fire on the American people if they ask 'em to do so if he wanted to take the guns away from 'em. This man is a Communist dictator. We need him out of the White House now. And the Congress of the United States is the only one -- we've lost our Congress. We've lost our executive.:Last updated:   19 March 2015"
187,187,704.OregonRefugeOccupati,"An armed occupation at Oregon's Malheur Wildlife Refuge Oregon took a dramatic turn during a traffic stop Tuesday, when authorities shot and killed one man and arrested several others.The group was apparently en route from their refuge encampment to the nearby city of John Day, where they planned to participate in a community meeting, when they were intercepted by federal and state agencies and ordered to surrender.Details are still unclear, but Robert ""LaVoy"" Finicum -- the colorful de facto spokesman of the militant group -- was apparently shot and killed by agents, who also arrested five people at the scene: leader Ammon Bundy, his brother Ryan Bundy, security detail Brian ""Booda"" Cavalier, Shawna Cox, and Ryan Payne.In Burns, Oregon State Police also arrested ""Captain"" Joseph O'Shaughnessy, and independent broadcaster Pete Santilli. Jon Ritzheimer, who had returned to Arizona where he lives with his family, turned himself in to officials there on Wednesday.:The Federal Bureau of Investigation said a total of eight people were arrested, each facing federal felony charges of conspiracy to impede officers of the United States from discharging their official duties through the use of force, intimidation or threats.Back at the refuge, many of the original group packed up their belongings and left. However, a handful of people still remain in what now appears to be a standoff with federal agents. They are intermittently livestreaming videos and pledging to fight to the death."
188,188,624.DoesaLeakedVideoReve,"Claim:A leaked Pentagon video reveals a government plot to vaccinate people against thoughts, ideas, and religion.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 20 January 2015, the disreputable web site Natural News published an article titled ""600 strains of an aerosolized thought control vaccine already tested on humans; deployed via air, food and water."" According to the article, a ""leaked Pentagon video"" revealed the government had tested a mind-control vaccine dubbed FunVax (fundamentalist vaccine) on unwitting civilian populations.:The claim stated the vaccine was dispensed through large-scale spraying, vehicle exhaust, food, and water. (It should be noted with the exception of nasally administered flu vaccines, most vaccines are still dispensed through far more unwieldy syringes.) Central to the rumors were a single YouTube video described as a ""leaked Pentagon presentation"" and a link to a website on which those plans were purportedly detailed, like this rumor we collected from the internet:Pentagon FunVax presentation on how the military can spread a virus and use a vaccine to extinguish ""undesirable human behavior"". Behavior modification through vaccination. Say goodbye to your free will. https://youtu.be/-gfTqfVeLHw The article explained while these claims have circulated since at least 2011 (the date of the video's publication on YouTube), an increase in ""medical police state"" activity had enabled people to ""connect the dots"" about the covert deployment of this mind control vaccine::As you'll see in the document and video below, the vaccine was intended from the start to be deployed against civilian populations, and 600 strains of infectious viruses were tested on human subjects. One of the transmission vectors documented in the testing exploited an influenza strain to spread the mind-infecting virus as a pandemic.The point of all this is to infect the minds of the population and transform people into what the government calls ""normal."" From the government's point of view, of course, ""normal"" means ""obedient and mindless.""This is all described in a video and a document that surfaced several years ago but which are only now beginning to connect the dots as the medical police state in America accelerates to insane levels of aggression against the population. See recent stories on medical kidnapping in Arkansas and CPS kidnapping of children in Arizona for starters.The video that supposedly exposed the FunVax plot has been circulating the Internet since at least 2011, yet no event or circumstance has validated the claims made in or about it since its first appearance, and recent interest in the clip came about solely through its ""discovery"" by Natural News. The document appended as supplemental proof to the long-circulating video [PDF] is hosted on wanttoknow.info, a site devoted to discussion and dispersal of conspiracy-related material. While legitimate documents can and do sometimes emerge through what appear initially to be unreliable channels, no source is given for this ""quarterly FunVax report"" dated to June 2007. On the site itself, the poster of the document admitted the video and the document were possibly faked and no evidence corroborating their authenticity was known::Though this may sound like some bizarre science fiction novel, the four-minute Pentagon video presentation and official FunVax report below show that this vaccine against fundamentalism is actively being tested for implementation. As it has been a few years since this date of this video and report, it is entirely possible this program has already been started.There is some possibility that the above video and document are faked. But if they are, it is very intelligent disinformation. Who would spend all of the time and money required to come up with such a sophisticated and coherent story? And why? Knowing how science and the military often work together, a program like this is all too possible. I once attended a lecture by Al Gore's science advisor in which he said he had been invited to see some of the most secret biological research programs being undertaken by the U.S. military. He said it gave him nightmares for months. It's likely true a number of covert programs would send chills down the spines of most Americans were they made privy to the nuts and bolts of strategic defense planning, biological or otherwise. As to who might be responsible for such disinformation, that could be anyone's guess. However, right around the time FunVax conspiracy theories began to circulate, an active Kickstarter campaign titled ""FunVax -- A Film About the Conspiracy"" was launched by an individual named Ryan Harper. (The campaign ultimately failed to achieve its funding goal.)  Harper is also the registrant for the domain FunVax.com, a site ostensibly created to promote the film.:Notably, much of the speculation about FunVax occurred in 2011 and 2012 (Harper registered the domain in April 2011), and almost all claims made about it lead back to Harper and the film project. The clip in question was not ""leaked"" until September 2011, making the chronology of the FunVax conspiracy even more suspicious. While it's possible a separate source disseminated the video as Harper endeavored to fund and film his documentary, there's also no compelling evidence any information about FunVax originated from a source other than Harper himself.As for that video, it too has provoked skepticism even among those who've not examined the source of the claims. All identifying details (such as date and context) were supplied by its original poster, and the low resolution of the footage makes it difficult to determine whether the audio portion was tacked on to an extant video from another source entirely.Ultimately, those objections are secondary to the logistically and scientifically implausible aspects of the FunVax rumor. First and foremost, while the ""God gene"" is a popular bit of pop science, it isn't supported by any peer-reviewed evidence::Is the God gene real? The only evidence we have to go on at the moment is what Hamer presents in his book. He and his colleagues are still preparing to submit their results to a scientific journal. It would be nice to know whether these results can withstand the rigors of peer review. It would be nicer still to know whether any other scientists can replicate them. The field of behavioral genetics is littered with failed links between particular genes and personality traits. These alleged associations at first seemed very strong. But as other researchers tried to replicate them, they faded away into statistical noise. In 1993, for example, a scientist reported a genetic link to male homosexuality in a region of the X chromosome. The report brought a huge media fanfare, but other scientists who tried to replicate the study failed. The scientist's name was Dean Hamer.In short, the FunVax rumor originated largely with a filmmaker who sought to create a documentary of the same name about the ""FunVax conspiracy."" The only evidence supporting the rumor is a YouTube video of questionable veracity and an unsourced document that purportedly describes the project. The entire concept of FunVax (which was supposedly already secretly developed, produced, and tested on unwitting Americans) hinged on a ""God gene"" theory that has yet to pass peer review or yield any known applications. Furthermore, this unproven gene theory supposedly inspired a wide-scale vaccination program involving technologies heretofore unseen in all other areas of working medical science. None of these related technologies (including vastly simplified and effective dispensation of vaccines) has ever been applied or even piloted in any areas of science or medicine before, and are so covert they are virtually unknown in documented pharmaceutical technology. Taken alone, these objections would cast the rumor into the territory of science fiction; all together, it's pretty clear the claim is impossible on many levels.:It's also worth mentioning the FunVax claim may sound slightly familiar to Firefly fans, as it very closely matches the main plot line of the film Serenity (spoiler alert):"

I get my food from the grocery store.""Rating:Labeled SatireAbout this rating In February 2022, as a trucker protest against COVID-19 vaccination requirements clogged roads in Canada, a quote ostensibly uttered by U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was circulated on social media. AOC supposedly said: ""I don't need truckers. I get my food from the grocery store.""::This is not a genuine quote from Ocasio-Cortez. This is a screenshot of a satirical article that was published on the website Genesius Times. This website bills itself as ""the most reliable source of fake news on the planet"" and states that it provides ""the most up-to-date, accurate fake news on the Internet.""It's worth noting that this satirical article is simply a regurgitated version of a previously existing piece of political disinformation. In 2018, forums dedicated to the right-wing conspiracy theory QAnon started attributing a similar quote (""we don't need farmers, we have stores"") to various liberal politicians in an attempt to smear them. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Democratic politician Stacey Abrams, and, unsurprisingly, AOC were all falsely accused of saying this. :While this quote has been used in recent years in attempts to smear politicians, its origins stretch back decades. We found iterations of the quote stretching back to the 1970s. In most cases, the statement (or a near verbatim copy of it) appeared in articles about the disconnect between rural and urban communities. Here's a newspaper clipping from 1988: 29 Jul 1988, Fri The Philadelphia Inquirer (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) Newspapers.com:"
190,190,188.MissouriGOPBlamesGeo,"On 22 February 2018, Missouri governor Eric Greitens was indicted on a felony invasion of privacy charge stemming from allegations that he blackmailed a woman with whom he was having an extramarital affair using a nude photo he had taken without her consent.As reported by the Washington Post:The indictment states that Greitens then photographed the woman ""in a state of full or partial nudity"" without her knowledge or consent. Greitens then ""transmitted the image contained in the photograph in a manner that allowed access to that image via a computer,"" which is a felony.The next day, the Missouri GOP attempted to defend Greitens not by offering any challenge against allegations themselves, but instead by offering up a conspiracy-theory-tinged attack against the prosecutor in the case, St. Louis circuit attorney Kim Gardner.:In a 23 February 2018 post on Twitter, Missouri Republicans argued that the indictment was a political hit job because Gardner had taken more than $200,000 from billionaire financier George Soros:Kim Gardner has received more than $200,000 from George Soros groups,"" said Sam Cooper Executive Director of the Missouri Republican Party. ""Missourians should see this for what it is, a political hit job. This law has never been prosecuted in this way and it is safe to say if Eric Greitens wasn't governor, it wouldn't have been this time either.We have a progressive anti-law enforcement Democrat wanting to single-handedly oust a law-and-order governor. We look forward to a bipartisan committee of legislators elected by people across Missouri to find out what's really going on - ensuring St. Louis liberals aren't controlling the future of our state."" Cooper here is referencing factual reports that Gardner received support during her 2016 campaign for circuit attorney from a Super PAC connected to George Soros -- the Safety & Justice Commission -- which included efforts that funded television and Internet s. A 24 July 2016 story in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported::Last week, Gardner's campaign disclosed to the Missouri Ethics Commission a $67,693.23 in-kind contribution from the super PAC. The group apparently took in additional money after June 30, since it donated more to Gardner than it had on hand at that time. But any money donated to the PAC after June 30 won't be made public until its next quarterly report is filed on Oct. 15.On July 26, Gardner's campaign reported to the Missouri Ethics Commission a $24,548.37 in-kind donation from the same federal campaign committee, a day after reporting a $25,738.86 contribution from that super PAC. Then on July 29, Gardner reported an additional $72,770.27 from Safety & Justice, bringing the Soros-backed super PAC total contribution to Gardner's campaign to at least $190,750.73.George Soros, a wealthy businessman and philanthropist who donates money to causes he supports (as wealthy people have always done) is arguably one of the most common targets of the far-right conspiracy theory world. Conjuring his name -- at least in the dark corners of the Internet that house conspiracy theorists -- is a symbol of a left-wing ""globalist"" conspiracy to destroy the United States as we know it. (No motive is usually given for this purported desire.):People running for political office frequently take money from billionaire financiers. Sheldon Adelson, described sometimes as the George Soros of the right, gave $200,000 to the Greitens' gubernatorial campaign, and Greitens also received millions of dollars in support for his GOP primary campaign from super PACs that effectively conceal the names of those who donate.If the vague invocation of shadowy, rich puppet masters is a valid way to discredit the actions of a politician, then at the very least a dispute between Gardner and Greitens on those terms would end be a draw. The Soros gambit may work for Infowars, but as a legal defense against the malicious use of a nude photo taken without consent to hide an extramarital affair, it is a bit of a non-sequitur."
191,191,160.NoBidenDidntWearaWir,"Claim:Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden wore a ""wire"" and high-tech contact lenses that allowed him to receive talking points from an unseen third party during the first presidential debate.Rating:FalseAbout this rating A conspiracy theory spread during and in the days immediately following the first presidential debate on Sept. 29, 2020, that alleged Democratic candidate Joe Biden was wearing various technological aids, which fed him talking points while debating U.S. President Donald Trump.:NBC News reported that rumors Biden's debate night performance was aided by a wire or other technology were part of a coordinated amplification of disinformation, which was pushed by the Trump campaign. The conspiracy echoes one that claimed Trump's 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton wore a secret earpiece during a debate.The conspiracy theories were shared by numerous social media users -- including actor James Woods on Twitter, where he has 2.6 million followers. For example he shared a low-resolution video showing a dark line on Biden's shirt, in which a man could be heard exclaiming, ""There it is! Biden's wearing a wire! Why do you need a wire bro!"": As USA Today pointed out, the line in Biden's shirt can be seen in a high resolution version of the video -- but it disappears when he moves, because it's just a crease in the material of his shirt.Woods also shared a poor-quality photograph to promote another conspiracy theory claiming that Biden was wearing high-tech contact lenses that allowed him to read a script provided to him by an unseen source, arguing that the proof was that Biden's eyes looked darker in the photograph than their natural color:: Many claimed that Biden specifically wore lenses made by a tech company called Mojo, which is developing a ""smart"" contact lens. We will provide an example of one such post on Facebook, with the user's name cropped out for the sake of privacy::But a spokesperson for Mojo Vision told us that wouldn't be possible.""It's exciting that people are following our product with such great imagination,"" the company said in a statement. ""The reality is that only the Mojo team has worn our smart contact lens and it doesn't have FDA clearance yet.""We zoomed in on a higher-quality video so that Biden's shirt crease and blue eye color can be seen, indicating that the dark line wasn't a wire, and that he wasn't wearing black contact lenses::Woods shared yet another meme that contained an outline drawing that indicated Biden was supposedly wearing a ""special communication device."" The ""device"" was, per the meme, made up of headphones that attached in his pocket and left hand. It also contained a close-up image of Biden's left hand.:The dark object on Biden's left wrist, circled in the above meme, isn't part of a wire device. It's a rosary that Biden wears that belonged to his son Beau Biden, who died in 2015 of cancer.Biden, who is Catholic, talked about wearing the beads during a 2017 ""Today"" show interview conducted by then-host Megyn Kelly. During the interview, the beads were visible on Biden's left wrist. He explained wearing them, stating:Beau wore these. Hunt got these for Beau and me at Our Lady of Guadalupe down in Mexico, and I visited there, and we all wore them. I'm a practicing Catholic, Beau was a devout Catholic as well. And it was more -- both of us found solace in the elements of the church, it's almost like meditation for us. And so, I have not taken off the rosary Beau was wearing when he passed, since then. But it's my connection with him. I'm not trying to be, I'm not preaching, I'm not talking about, it's not even about religion per se. It's about the connection. And it just always makes me feel good. I know he's with me, just touching them."

Not only did a meteor flash across the sky, causing a small earthquake, but a garage went up in flames, and over the border in Ohio, an oil refinery conducted a controlled burn -- all at the same time. As images of these three events started to make their way around the Internet, conspiracy theorists concocted a bizarre explanation that tied them all together: the government (or possibly aliens, or maybe both) had unleashed a direct energy weapon on the world::The web site Before It's News collected some of the most compelling images and summarized the theory: The Rod of God. A Directed Energy Weapon. Main stream presstituts will have you believe this was a meteor, a meteor that fell at a perfect 90* angle. SMH.. This just happened a few hours ago in Taylor, Michigan. 01/16/18. This energy blast was seen and heard in 4 US states and Canada.The United States Geological Survey reports a 2.0 magnitude earthquake at 8:09 p.m. January 16, 2018 - exactly the same time a meteor flashed through the sky in Michigan.The earthquake was a very weak earthquake having what is called a ""local magnitude"" (Ml) of 2.0. This USGS map shows a ""meteorite"" notation for the quake. A 2.0 magnitude earthquake would not be felt by humans.This is confusing because all the Meteor videos I can find for this day on YouTube show something else entirely than these photographs. The videos show like a regular ole meteor going thru the air. But these pictures show a percise ray of energy beamed down lighting the ground on fire. Could this be the same tech causing the wildfires all over the USA aka California etc? I don't know. That is why I am sharing this for discussion.:A meteor really was visible over Michigan on 16 January 2018. This was confirmed by the United States Geologic Society, NASA, the National Weather Service, astronomy experts, and a number of eyewitness videos:It's also true that the videos of the meteor passing over Michigan do not resemble the photographs that appeared to show a ray of light. But that's because those photographs don't actually show the meteor.:The center photograph in the collage above was most likely taken near a garage fire in the city of Taylor, Michigan. As news of the fire spread, so did rumors that the blaze was caused by a meteor crashing into the garage. Michigan news outlet MLive published a story about the phenomena, informing worried readers that the blaze was not actually started by a meteor crashing into it:A fire that destroyed a pickup truck inside a garage in the metro Detroit community of Taylor was not started by a piece of falling meteor fragment.Fire crews were called to a garage fire at about 8:24 p.m., Jan. 16, on Merrick Road after the homeowner noticed smoke coming from the engine compartment of a pickup he was working on inside the garage, according to the Taylor Fire Department.Images showing a bright streak of light soaring up into the sky likely show an oil refinery in Ohio conducting a controlled burn which caused ""light pillars"" (a visual effect that can occur in very cold winter weather) to appear in the sky. A number of people captured images of this refinery fire and the resulting light pillars:::Local news outlets such as Click On Detroit<Cleveland 19, and Fox 2 Detroit all published articles in January 2018 about these light pillars' forming:They look like lights from an alien spaceship, but they are actually light pillars, a spectacular sight most commonly seen during the colder winter months. The phenomenon's name describes narrow rods that appear to extend from the sky to the ground.Although the images do show something that resembles alien weapons used in movies such as Independence Day, these particular photographs do not document the deployment of such a device. Rather, the light pillars just happened to appear around the same time that a meteor was spotted streaking across the sky in Michigan, creating the perfect conditions for conspiracy theorists to spread rumors about otherworldly weaponry."
193,193,516.OperationBlockTheBus,"Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.On Oct. 30, 2020, a convoy of pickup trucks flying flags in support of U.S. President Donald Trump followed and surrounded a Biden-Harris presidential campaign bus on Interstate 35 in Texas. Viral video showed an apparent collision involving a white SUV that was accompanying the bus and a dark-colored pickup truck flying Trump flags. Days after the incident, Snopes reported on the facts of what happened on the road that day, as well as news that the FBI was investigating. New evidence has come to light that answers some questions but raises new ones.Alamo City Trump Train is one of the Facebook Groups where the Trump-supporting, pickup-truck convoy was organized. Inside the private group on Oct. 30, a member posted ""#OperationBlockTheBus RN,"" with ""RN"" meaning ""right now,"" as it was the same afternoon as the incident.:This post referring to blocking the campaign bus of Democratic candidate Joe Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, was endorsed with 142 reactions, including likes, laughing emojis, or love hearts. ""I LOVE IT!!!!,"" said one commenter. ""This is awesome,"" said another. Other comments included: ""Great job!,"" ""GOOD!,"" ""Love it,"" ""This is fucking hilarious,"" and ""Awesome.""In our study of the private group, we noted that it is littered with activity tied to the dangerous conspiracy theory known as QAnon. This goes against Facebook's policies. On Oct. 6, Facebook announced:Starting today, we will remove any Facebook Pages, Groups and Instagram accounts representing QAnon, even if they contain no violent content. This is an update from the initial policy in August that removed Pages, Groups and Instagram accounts associated with QAnon when they discussed potential violence while imposing a series of restrictions to limit the reach of other Pages, Groups and Instagram accounts associated with the movement. Pages, Groups and Instagram accounts that represent an identified Militarized Social Movement are already prohibited. And we will continue to disable the profiles of admins who manage Pages and Groups removed for violating this policy, as we began doing in August.:Mentions of QAnon abound inside the Alamo City Trump Train Facebook Group. For example, in one post a message purportedly from ""Q"" was posted as a screenshot, and a group member replied: ""WWG1WGA,"" referring to the QAnon slogan Where We Go One We Go All. Both the comment and reply were liked and loved by members. One person even reacted with the new ""care"" reaction.:""WWG1WGA"" is mentioned in several posts. One post referenced the NFL with the hashtag ""#WWG1WGA."" Another post showed multiple members introducing at least four other group members to QAnon, including the phrase ""WWG1WGA,"" as well as the concept of QAnon, all on Facebook's platform in a private group just days from Election Day.QAnon signage and flags were also a common sight at Alamo City Trump Train events, including in the group's YouTube videos.One group member made a new post on Oct. 31, questioning other news outlets that said the Trump supporters were ""armed.""

194,194,602.DidFauciFundGainofFu,"Claim:National Institutes of Health Director Anthony Fauci helped fund gain of function research at a facility in Wuhan, China, and that research ultimately led to the COVID-19 pandemic.Rating:UnprovenAbout this rating ContextThe claim that Fauci is ""responsible"" for the COVID-19 pandemic is based, in turn, on speculation that NIH-funded gain of function research resulted in a manipulated form of the coronavirus ""spilling over"" from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and infecting the human population. In October 2021, the congressional group U.S. House Oversight Committee revealed that a grantee of NIH funding failed to report the outcomes of an experiment involving coronaviruses infection in mouse models, prompting a secondary review by the federal agency. The NIH demanded researchers submit further documentation by the end of October. Until that information is made publicly available, we rate this claim as ""Unproven"":Snopes is still fighting an ""infodemic"" of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

During a May 10, 2021, airing of his Fox News show, host Tucker Carlson claimed that National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Anthony Fauci helped provide funding for ""gain of function"" research at a facility in Wuhan, China, that (supposedly) led to the COVID-19 pandemic. During that broadcast of ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" Carlson cited an opinion piece regarding the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic that was written by Nicolas Wade. In a nutshell, Wade argued without substantiated evidence that gain of function experiments (we'll explain what those are later) that were prohibited in the U.S. continued at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), which ultimately led to the creation of SARS-CoV-2. And because the Wuhan-based institute was not properly regulated, Wade argued, the novel coronavirus was likely to have infected a researcher who would ultimately become the source of the pandemic. :The 13-minute segment began with Carlson criticizing Jeffrey Zeints, U.S. President Joe Biden's appointed official to oversee the COVID-19 response efforts. Carlson then suggested that Fauci said Americans can expect to wear masks indefinitely. (We fact-checked that, too. Fauci did not say that.) ""The question is why is he doing that? Maybe he likes it, that's possible. But you gotta think at least part of Tony Fauci's authoritarian germ hysteria is a cover for something else,"" Carlson continued. ""Could it be that Tony Fauci is trying to divert attention from himself and his own personal role in the COVID-19 pandemic? Now, what do we mean by that?"":That's when Carlson pivoted to ""The origin of COVID: Did people or nature open Pandora's box at Wuhan?"" -- Wade's opinion piece -- not a scientific study as was suggested -- published by the nonprofit science organization Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, a reputable group that publishes free-access scientific information ""concerning science and global security issues."" Wade is a controversial science writer whose recent theories on race have been generally disputed by researchers around the world. Wade was a former staff writer for the Science Times section of The New York Times up until 2012 and he authored the controversial book, ""A Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race and Human History."" He has been described by researchers at Georgetown University as a ""sad saga"" of a ""former international reporter turned laughing stock.""By and large, Carlson hyperbolized and generalized Wade's main points in his piece, stretching the key takeaways to suggest that the article ""explains where this virus almost certainly came from."" Carlson furthered that Wade ""makes it clear that more than any other single American, Tony Fauci is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic"" by laying out a nearly ""insurmountably large amount of evidence"" that the virus originated in the WIV. This evidence included conducting experiments -- funded by ""American tax dollars"" -- to make bat viruses infectious to humans ""approved and directed by Tony Fauci,"" argued Carlson.:We'll take a closer look at what Wade actually wrote below.As is usual with these sorts of allegations, there is a mixture of half-truths peppered in an alarmist claim meant to incite an emotional response. First, it is important to note that Wade wrote in his opinion piece that of the two theories he believed were plausible, so far neither has ""direct evidence"" proving its validity. ""Each depends on a set of reasonable conjectures but so far lacks proof. So I have only clues, not conclusions, to offer. But those clues point in a specific direction. And having inferred that direction, I'm going to delineate some of the strands in this tangled skein of disaster,"" he wrote. After the Carlson video aired, questions surrounding gain of function research were brought to a Senate health committee hearing on May 11 when Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) clashed with Fauci over whether funding from the NIH was used at WIV, suggesting that this might have contributed to the ""lab leak"" hypothesis -- a controversial theory that virus-related experiments accidentally spilled over into the public sphere. :https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4962333/senator-paul-dr-fauci-clash-research-funding-wuhan-lab ""We have not funded gain of function research on this virus in the Wuhan Institute of Virology. No matter how many times you say it, it didn't happen,"" said Fauci. Wade -- and later Carlson -- also argued that gain of function research funded by the NIH was the likely source of a laboratory leak -- a hypothesis that has been contested by the broader scientific community time and again. Since SARS-CoV-2 was first named in January 2020 and subsequently declared a pandemic, conspiracy theorists have peddled notions that the virus was made in a lab and intentionally released as a biological weapon despite rigorous scientific research proving otherwise. First and foremost, it is true that WIV was one of many research facilities around the world dedicated to the study of coronaviruses. Coronaviruses are one of the most common viruses and were at the center of the SARS 2001 and MERS 2012 epidemics, prompting efforts led by the NIH and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and NIH to better understand their potential for a pandemic. : Research conducted at the Wuhan Institute of virology was partially funded by NIH. Public Domain :One form of research conducted at these labs includes the gain of function research. These are experiments to increase the transmissibility or virulence of pathogens to make them more infectious to humans in order to help improve understanding of disease-causing agents and how they interact with humans, as well as their potential to cause a pandemic. In other words, scientists manipulate the genetic code of viruses to change certain elements, making them either more or less dangerous to better understand how they work. But in 2014, the Obama administration called for a ""pause"" on funding of such experiments, SARS and MERS viruses in particular, and launched a government-led investigation into the risks and benefits of such research.  An ethical analysis white paper written by Professor Michael Selgelid and produced by the NIH Office of Science Policy and published in the journal, Science and Engineering Ethics in 2016 argued that gain of function research poses risks regarding biosecurity and biosafety. Using this guidance, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services developed a framework for guiding funding decisions about the gain of function research, and under the recommendation of experts, the NIH lifted its pause. :And it is true that WIV is located miles from where the first COVID-19 outbreak was detected and that the facility previously received funding from the NIH via the EcoHealth Alliance Inc., a research organization based in New York City, as was reported on the agency's website. But such international cooperation is not unusual, and funding to the lab was also provided through European, Asian, and African organizations as well as the World Health Organization and the European Virus Archive goes global.  To support its work, EcoHealth made subawards to the WIV and other institutions based in East Asia where coronaviruses tend to emerge and are prevalent. A subaward is made when the primary grant recipient (in this case, EcoHealth Alliance Inc.) seeks another organization to carry out part of the grantee's research project. In this case, NIH said that it did not establish the terms of the award and that EcoHealth was ""directly accountable for the performance of the project.""In an email to Snopes, EcoHealth Alliance communications manager Robert Kessler said that the organization has neither contributed to nor participated in gain-of-function research.:""The research proposed in the grant application sought to understand how bat coronaviruses evolve naturally in the environment to become transmissible to the human population,"" Jennifer Routh, a spokesperson for the NIH, told Snopes.""This included studying viral diversity in bat reservoirs, surveying people who work in live animal markets or other jobs with high exposure to wildlife for evidence of bat-coronavirus infection, and analyzing data to predict which newly discovered viruses pose the greatest threat to human health.""The application did not propose research to enhance any coronavirus to be more transmissible or virulent, added Routh. The application was subjected to rigorous peer review and was judged to be a high priority, given how SARS-CoV had already emerged in this bat population. To support its work, EcoHealth made sub-awards to WIV and other institutions based in East Asia where coronaviruses tend to emerge and are prevalent. And according to NIH, funds that go to sub-awardees (EcoHealth Alliance) from the primary grantee (NIH) must support the research activities that were approved and funded in the grant, which did not include gain of function research.:On May 19, Dr. Francis Collins with the NIH issued the below statement, which the agency forwarded to Snopes:Based on outbreaks of coronaviruses caused by animal to human transmissions such as in Asia in 2003 that caused Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and in Saudi Arabia in 2012 that caused Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), NIH and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) have for many years supported grants to learn more about viruses lurking in bats and other mammals that have the potential to spill over to humans and cause widespread disease. However, neither NIH nor NIAID have ever approved any grant that would have supported ""gain-of-function"" research on coronaviruses that would have increased their transmissibility or lethality for humans. NIH strongly supports the need for further investigation by the World Health Organization (WHO) into the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.The 2014 funding pause pertained to a subset of gain-of-function research that could reasonably be anticipated to confer attributes to influenza, MERS, or SARS viruses such that the virus would have enhanced pathogenicity or transmissibility in mammals via the respiratory route. Following the initiation of the pause, this grant was reviewed again and determined by experts to fall outside the scope of the funding pause.:But on Oct. 20, Republicans with the congressional group U.S. House Oversight Committee tweeted a letter written by Lawrence Tabak, principal deputy director of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), confirming that EcoHealth had conducted gain of function research at the WIV. The letter was directed to committee ranking member James Comer, R-Ky.The letter was reported by several publications, including The New York Post, Fox News, and The New York Times. In it, Tabak said that ""published genomic data demonstrate that the bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant to EcoHealth Alliance, INC. and subaward to the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) are not and could not have become SARS-CoV-2,"" referencing an analysis attached to the letter that was not included in the tweet. (Snopes contacted the DHHS to receive a copy of the letter and the referenced analysis but did not receive a reply at the time of this update. We will include a copy of the report when and if we receive it.):The letter was also said to contain the ""fifth and final progress report for Grand R01AI1 10964,"" which was awarded to EcoHealth Alliance, Inc. and included data from a research project conducted during the 2018-19 grant period using bat coronavirus genome sequences already existing in nature. The progress report was submitted to the NIH in August 2021 as part of NIH compliance enforcement efforts, and it shows that EcoHealth Alliance violated terms of the grant by failing to report a bat experiment that made mice sicker:The limited experiment described in the final progress report provided by EcoHealth Alliance was testing if spike proteins from naturally occurring bat coronaviruses circulating in China were capable of binding to the human ACE2 receptor in a mouse model. All other aspects of the mice, including the immune system, remained unchanged. In this limited experiment, laboratory mice were infected with the SHC014 WIV1 bat coronavirus. As sometimes occurs in science, this was an unexpected result of the research as opposed to something that the researchers set out to do. Regardless, the viruses being studied under this grant were genetically very distant from SARS-CoV-2.:Coronaviruses, especially those found in bats, have been studied around the world due to their prevalence in the natural world and ability to infect across species. In fact, there are hundreds of coronaviruses, most of which circulate among animals and some of which can jump to humans in what is called a spillover event. Following the SARS and MERS outbreaks of 2002 and 2012 respectively, the NIAID identified coronaviruses as a priority for researchers to investigate, including how these viruses originate and cause disease, as well as to develop animal study models for new treatments and potential vaccines.SHC014 is a SARS-like coronavirus that infects horseshoe bats that has previously been studied by researchers in mouse models to determine the risk of a SARS-CoV reemergence of infection risk from viruses that naturally circulate in bat populations. During the pandemic, the human ACE2 receptor saw renewed interest by the research community for its role as the entry point for SARS-CoV-2 infection.In short, the letter by Tabak stated that mice genetically altered to contain the ACE2 receptor were used as testers to determine whether SHC014 would bind to the receptor. And because the laboratory mice became sicker, it is likely that the virus successfully bound.:In July 2021, the NIH published a media kit that described its research involving enhanced potential pandemic pathogens (PPPs), which are those that show potential in infecting human populations. Research involving PPPs is required to undergo additional scrutiny when it comes to funding, but at the time of the grant proposal, EcoHealth Alliance's research did not meet the requirements for further review because it was not shown that these bat coronaviruses could infect humans.However, grant language allowed for a second review ""out of an abundance of caution"" pending results to determine whether the research should be reevaluated or new biosafety measures be enacted""EcoHealth failed to report this finding right away, as was required by the terms of the grant,"" wrote Tabak. ""EcoHealth is being notified that they have five days from today [Oct. 20] to submit to NIH any and all unpublished data from the experiments and work conducted under this review.A joint World Health Organization-China study on the origins of COVID-19 published in March 2019 said that transmission of the virus from bats to humans through another animal is the most likely scenario and that a lab leak is ""extremely unlikely."" However, the NIH told Snopes that it ""strongly supports the need for further investigation by the World Health Organization (WHO) into the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.:""Working with a cross-regional coalition of 13 countries, we urge the WHO to begin the second phase of their study without delay,"" wrote Collins.In short, gain of function research is permitted under certain conditions, and some evidence suggests that such experimentation may have occurred in the past at WIV. At the time of this writing, it appears that experiments to manipulate a coronavirus resulted from research conducted by EcoHealth Alliance during the 2018-19 grant period, but there is not yet conclusive evidence to suggest outright that the virus mutated to SARS-CoV-2, or that it spilled over into the surrounding area. Snopes will update this article once further information into the investigation is provided by EcoHealth Alliance and NIH. Until then, we left this claim rating as ""Unproven.""

195,195,382.TheDisappearanceofAs,"Claim:The town of Ashley, Kansas, and its entire population disappeared after an earthquake in 1952.Rating:FalseAbout this rating The strange and spooky tale of a town known as Ashley, Kansas (and the fate of its more than 670 residents) after an anomalous incident in 1952 has circulated the Internet for several years. In terms of unexplained events, it's an interesting narrative: a middle-of-the-night earthquake followed weeks of strange happenings; and the town of Ashley -- along with everyone who lived there -- abruptly disappeared. But if you search for any historical mention of Ashley, Kansas, you'll come up short. No such town is shown on any period maps, nor is it included in any census records. :In March 2012, what was likely the first version of the Ashley, Kansas, story was published to a popular creepypasta wiki (i.e., a site for short horror stories that are especially frightening or unnerving) in a version that began as follows:Sometime during the night of August 16, 1952, the small town of Ashley, Kansas ceased to exist. At 3:28am on August 17, 1952, a magnitude 7.9 earthquake was measured by the United States Geological Survey. The earthquake itself was felt throughout the state and most of the midwest. The epicenter was determined to be directly under Ashley, Kansas.When state law enforcement arrived at what should have been the outskirts of the farming community, they found a smoldering, burning fissure in the earth measuring 1,000 yards in length and approximately 500 yards in width. The depth of the fissure was never determined.After twelve days, the state-wide and local search for the missing 679 residents of Ashley, Kansas, was called off by the Kansas State Government at 9:15pm on the night of August 29, 1952. All 679 residents were assumed to be dead. At 2:27am on August 30, 1952, a magnitude 7.5 earthquake was measured by the United States Geological Survey. The epicenter was situated under what used to be the location of Ashley, Kansas. When law enforcement investigated at 5:32am, they reported that the fissure in the Earth had closed.In the eight days leading up to the disappearance of the town and its 679 residents, bizarre and unexplainable events were reported by dozens of residents in Ashley, Kansas and law enforcement from the surrounding area.:This story is classic creepypasta: a chillingly fun, but decidedly fictional, tale. In addition to the version cited above, a story titled ""The Disappearance of Ashley, Kansas"" was subsequently posted to Reddit's r/nosleep forum, a site devoted to sharing works of horror fiction. Prior to those Internet mentions in 2012, Ashley existed neither in reality nor imagination.  Moreover, only one earthquake was recorded in Kansas in 1952, and that event occurred in April rather than August. An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 to 7.9 hitting Kansas would have become local, if not national, lore (much less a pair of such earthquakes occurring within two weeks of each other at the same site), yet no record of such a geological occurrence exists.  And even if, in typical conspiracy theory fashion, the powers that be conspired to conceal whatever purportedly happened in Ashley, proof of the town's existence would remain in other texts, maps, and records antedating 1952.

196,196,169.WasaBodyFoundintheOh,"Claim:A dead body that washed ashore on the Ohio River was identified as that of a man who worked as both an aide to Hillary Clinton and a bodyguard to Clinton's daughter, Chelsea.Rating:FalseAbout this rating A classic Internet conspiracy theory, ""Clinton Body Bags,"" reared its ugly head again in February 2019 in the form of a post on the junk news website stating that the body of a former Hillary Clinton aide had been found washed up on the shore of the Ohio River.:America's Last Line of Defense (LLOD) reported that the body was discovered in the small town of St. Clairsville in the eastern part of Ohio:On Tuesday, police in Saint Clairsville, Ohio announced some troubling news to the small town: a dead body had washed ashore on the Ohio River. Authorities told residents not to worry, that the body had probably drifted there from somewhere hundreds of miles away based on the amount of damage -- and they were right.An investigation concluded on Saturday that the corpse was, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the inhumed remains of Jaeger Holpern, aide to Hillary Clinton for more than a decade -- including in the 2012 and 2016 elections. He also worked as a bodyguard for Chelsea Clinton from 2017-November 2018.The post went on to say that the victim appeared to have been tortured and was killed by a bullet fired from close range into the back of his head. ""As of yet it is unclear who murdered Holpern, but the timing suggests that it was someone connected to Hillary Clinton,"" the text continued. ""Yet another body is added to Clinton's pile. How many skeletons will we ultimately find in her closet?"":The decades-old ""body bags"" conspiracy theory holds that dozens of former ""Clinton associates"" have died under so-called ""mysterious circumstances"" since President Bill Clinton took office in 1993. Based on nothing more than innuendo and (at best) circumstantial evidence, proponents of the theory claim the Clintons had countless people done away with because those people crossed the family or possessed incriminating information about them.This new article purporting to add yet one more body to the list was a work of pure fiction. The town of St. Clairsville, where the body supposedly washed up,& is at least 10 miles away from the banks of the Ohio River.  And the name ""Jaeger Holpern"" isn't one that has ever (before this) been associated with the Clinton family. Indeed, it's an anagram of the name of the pseudonymous author of the piece, one ""Jolee Garphren.""The network of websites and social media accounts operating under the ""America's Last Line of Defense"" banner publish politically divisive content for the purpose of trolling conservative readers, characterizing it as ""satirical"" in disclaimers such as the following::Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical.At least two other blogs republished the article verbatim without including any such disclaimer."
197,197,217.DidPelosiIssueaState,"Claim:U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office published a news release referring to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's political affiliation as ""Q-CA"" in reference to the QAnon conspiracy movement.Rating:Correct AttributionAbout this rating On Feb. 3, 2021, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office published a news release with the header ""McCarthy (Q-CA) Fails to Lead, Hands Keys to Party to Greene""::The press release and reference to ""Q"" is a dig at House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who is a California Republican. The ""Q"" swipe was in reference to his refusal to discipline U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., for her support of various conspiracy theories, including ""QAnon.""Greene ran unopposed in the November 2020 election, and has espoused support not just for QAnon, a dangerous and convoluted set of conspiracy theories that, as we have reported, posits that ""Trump is in the middle of a biblical war against a 'deep state,' satanic cabal of baby-eating, child sex-traffickers led by prominent members of the Democratic party, entertainers who espouse liberal opinions, anybody who mentions 'pizza,' and authoritative sources who relay credible information that may cast a negative light"" on Trump.:Greene has actively promoted other conspiracy theories, such as ones that claim school shootings are hoaxes intended to take people's guns away. She has also promoted false and racist claims that former U.S. President Barack Obama was ""secretly Muslim,"" and questioned the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.Greene has come to symbolize what has been described as a rift in the Republican Party which came to a head in the aftermath of a deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in which rioters, incited by a baseless conspiracy theory pushed by then-President Donald Trump and his supporters about mass-scale voter fraud in the November 2020 presidential election, attacked the Capitol. Five people died in the violence.While some Republican legislators have condemned Greene for her incendiary rhetoric and conspiracy theories, others have stood by her. Pelosi's news release criticized McCarthy for refusing to strip Greene of committee assignments, and announced that House Democrats would force a vote on removing Greene from committees, thus strong-arming Republicans to go on the record about whether or not they support for her.:"
198,198,497.WereTheseMexicanPoli,"Claim:Photographs show police officers who were brutalized by members of a migrant caravan in October 2018.Rating:MiscaptionedAbout this rating On 20 October 2018, Twitter user Mike Allen posted a photograph of an injured police officer and stated that the pictured individual had been ""brutalized"" by a member of the migrant caravan that was making its way toward the United States in the fall of 2018:::Facebook user Jacque Guinan posted a nearly verbatim message which included two additional images of police officers who were also allegedly ""brutalized"" by this caravan of refugees ::We also found a network of smaller Twitter accounts parroting the same verbatim claim: ""Mexican police are being brutalized by members of this caravan as they attempt to FORCE their way into Mexico""::A caravan of migrants fleeing political and social unrest in their home country of Honduras was slowly making its way north in the fall of 2018 with the hopes that its participants could seek asylum in the United States. Some conservative pundits and politicians used this group of migrants to stoke fears about immigration. Florida Representative Matt Gaetz even floated an unfounded conspiracy theory positing (without evidence) that these refugees were being paid by alt-right boogeyman George Soros. President Trump, too, declared (without evidence) that this group consisted of ""criminals"" and ""unknown Middle Easteners.""The above-displayed photographs appear to be yet another attempt to smear this group of refugees and stoke fears over immigration. These pictures do not capture police officers who were brutalized by members of the immigrant caravan making its way toward the United States in October 2018 -- they're all several years old and depict the aftermath of altercations between police officers and protesters in Mexico.The main photograph attached to this rumor (showing an officer with a bloodied face) came from a 2012 incident involving students (not migrants) and police officers near Mexico City. Revista Emeequis reported that the students had been staging a protest at the school for more than a week when police officers came in and attempted to evict them from the building. More than 170 students were detained and at least 9 officers were injured during the altercation::Mexico City, October 16 (2012). In a series of operations carried out early Monday morning, state and federal authorities detained 176 students from the teacher training schools of Cheran, Arteaga, and Tripetio in Michoacan.The arrests occurred as the police officers cleared the school buildings, which for 10 days had been occupied by students protesting against changes in the school curriculum ...A spokesman for the state government, Julio Cesar Hernandez, told a news conference that nine federal police officers and one member of the Special Operations Group (GOE) were injured during the operations.The two other photographs attached to this rumor were also years-old and unrelated to migrant caravans. The image showing an injured officer on his knees on the street was taken in 2014 in Chilpancingo and was included in a gallery of photographs on the Mexican newspaper El Universal's web site and depicted another violent incident between police and students. According to BBC News, tensions between the police and protesters had been rising since a group of 43 students went missing a few months earlier in September 2014::Mexican police have clashed with protesters organising a concert in the city of Chilpancingo in support of a group of 43 students who went missing more than two months ago.:Police said several officers had been injured, including some who were knocked down by a vehicle.The two groups accused each other of starting Sunday's violence.The case of the missing students, one of whom has been found dead, has triggered protests across Mexico.The other image associated with this rumor was also snapped several years earlier and was in no way related to a Honduran migrant caravan. The photograph displaying an officer with a bloodied lip has been online since at least 2011, when it was shared in articles concerning another altercation between ""police and teachers""::State Governor Gabino Cue Monteagudo offered a public apology to the people of Oaxaca for the grievances caused by ""police and teachers"" during their clash in the city's Zocalo and reiterated their willingness to engage in a new dialogue with Section 22 of the SNTE.Through a statement, the state government refused to grant the resignations of the Secretary General of Government, Irma Pineyro Arias; the head of the Secretariat of Public Security, Marco Tulio Lopez Escamilla, and the director of the State Institute of Public Education of Oaxaca (IEEPO), Bernardo Vasquez Colmenares, as demanded by the teachers after the drift and during the mega-march made yesterday in the city From Oaxaca.""The Government of the State disclaims any attempt of aggression or action that seeks to undermine the right to free expression, free transit and association, reserving its power to intervene when public order is affected, as well as physical and patrimonial integrity of third parties."""
199,199,489.WereProTrumpMobsStor,"Claim:Antifa, not a mob of Trump supporters, violently clashed with police and broke into the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On Jan. 6, 2021, supporters of outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump violently converged on the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. in support of Trump's false claims that the November 2020 presidential election was beset by massive scale voter fraud that led to his loss.:Trump supporters at the Capitol brawled with police and broke through barricades, eventually breaking into the building while Congress was in the process of counting electoral college votes and confirming President-elect Joe Biden's win.Some on social media started spreading unfounded rumors that the violent chaos was being instigated not by Trump supporters, but by anti-fascist activists, colloquially known by the portmanteau antifa.There is no evidence that the mob storming Capitol grounds and violently engaging police are antifa -- in fact the social media accounts spreading the rumor are followers of the QAnon conspiracy theory. Here is one example of one such tweet, which reads, ""BREAKING: PATRIOTS ARE NOT STORMING ANYTHING!! PAID FOR ANTIFA DOES, PERIOD!!""::It was Trump himself who encouraged his supporters to march to the Capitol, as CNN White House reporter Kevin Liptak reported:Shortly after, his supporters took him at his word and marched to the Capitol, breached the building, and as of this writing, were inside.:Members of the right wing extremist group Proud Boys, which is known for provoking violence and brawling, have also boasted in discussions leading up to the attack on the Capitol that they would forego their ""uniform"" -- which consists of black and yellow -- in favor of all-black garb. When they do show up at protests, antifa activists typically wear all black.Qanon followers have been deemed a potential violent threat by the FBI. Here is how we previously reported on the Qanon belief system:In general, QAnon believes Trump is in the middle of a biblical war against a ""deep state,"" satanic cabal of baby-eating, child sex-traffickers led by prominent members of the Democratic party, entertainers who espouse liberal opinions, anybody who mentions ""pizza,"" and authoritative sources who relay credible information that may cast a negative light on the president. Proponents of this theory believe that one day soon the ""storm"" will come and Trump, with the help of an anonymous high-ranking military official known as ""Q,"" will round up members of the deep state, arrest them, and possibly have them executed.:Based on the fact that the sources of this rumor are unreliable, and the fact that Trump urged his supporters to do exactly what they're doing now, and that an extremist group known for provoking violence stated that it had planned to dress in black to ""blend in,"" we rate this rumor ""False.""In the days following the attack on the Capitol, wrenching scenes of police officers battered by the mob drew public outrage. Right wing figures on social media continued to push the baseless narrative in an attempt to blame left wing activists associated with antifa and the Black Lives Matter civil rights movement for the violence. Five people were killed, including a Capitol police officer, and dozens of outnumbered police were injured, many of whom fought hand-to-hand with rioters in an effort to prevent them from breaching the building.Some right wing figures pointed to John Sullivan, an accused agent provocateur who filmed the death of Ashli Babbitt, an Air Force veteran and Trump supporter who was shot by police when she tried to break through a barricaded door as rioters broke into the building. Sullivan was arrested in Utah on Jan. 14, 2021, on charges related to the riot.:For example, right wing junk site Gateway Pundit's headline reported, ""BREAKING: FBI Arrests Antifa Leader John Sullivan in Utah After Storming US Capitol ...Update: With FBI Affidavit."" The story was tweeted by ""Happy Days"" actor and Trump supporter Scott Baio. The unfounded claim has even been embraced by some members of Congress, including U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Alabama, who has come under fire for an incendiary speech at a rally that preceded the mob attack on the Capitol.But Sullivan, a Utah resident, isn't an ""antifa leader,"" and the idea that he's part of the Black Lives Matter movement was rejected by the local chapter in his home state, as The Intercept's Robert Mackey noted in a detailed analysis:""In fact, Sullivan is a curious figure who is treated with suspicion or outright hostility by a number of left-wing organizers associated with Black Lives Matter and antifascism in Utah, California and the Pacific Northwest.""Mackey went on to report that left wing activists in various cities have warned against associating with Sullivan, accusing him of harmful actions and exploiting protests movements for personal gain.:The FBI said during a Jan. 8, 2021, news conference that there was ""no indication"" that anyone from the antifa movement was involved in the attack. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican who has been an outspoken Trump supporter, bluntly rejected the claim that the riot was instigated by left wing activists, stating, ""Some say the riots were caused by antifa. There is absolutely no evidence of that. And conservatives should be the first to say so."""
200,200,59.DoesVideoShowBidenPr,"Claim:A video of U.S. President Joe Biden from 2015 shows him promoting an agenda to make ""white Americans"" of European descent an ""absolute minority"" in the U.S. through ""nonstop"" immigration of people of color.Rating:FalseAbout this rating ContextThis clip has been presented out of context and misrepresented. While Biden did repeat a demographic forecast that by 2017, white Americans of European descent would become an ""absolute minority,"" that statement was not indicative of a plan or policy initiative to replace white Americans through immigration.:A 2015 video clip of then-U.S. Vice President Joe Biden recirculated years later, in 2023, along with the sinister conspiracy theory that he has an agenda of reducing the ""white Americans'"" portion of the population by making immigration to the U.S. easier.On Feb. 13, 2023, a tweet containing the video claimed: ""Joe Biden Fantasizes About Making White Americans an 'Absolute Minority' Through 'Non-Stop' Immigration [...] One of the few promises he has kept."" :Many onlookers pointed to the footage as alleged evidence of Biden supporting and promoting what is known to white supremacist conspiracy theorists as the ""great replacement,"" the notion that a plan exists to replace part or all of the country's white population with a non-white ""inferior"" population. The theory is also antisemitic, in that some believers blame Jewish people for setting the ""great replacement"" in motion. Other tweets condemning Biden's comments inserted the bracketed phrase ""[We want]"" in front of quotes from the video to change their context and meaning: :Such posts actively misrepresented what Biden actually said in 2015. First, he was referencing white Americans of European descent, specifically. Further, he was not promoting an active agenda of replacing that group or other ""white Americans"" with immigrants of color, and no other evidence shows that he has acted on, or supported, such policies to make that happen. Also, he did not characterize demographic shifts as a result of his, or any politician's, policies, but rather was repeating forecasts that showed that in the coming years, Americans of white European descent would be inevitably be in the minority. The proportion of the population that ticks the ""White alone non-Hispanic"" box in the Census forms has fallen. The 2020 Census states that the ""White alone non-Hispanic population"" stands at 57.8 percent, and that group's proportion of the population has decreased considerably since 2010. However, we should note that Iranians, and other communities from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region are officially categorized as white by the federal government, even as they are not considered white in other aspects of U.S. society. Biden was specifically talking about ""White European stock,"" which would be a subset of this group. :Despite the framing of the 2023 social media posts, at no point in the speech did Biden say anything that can be reasonably interpreted as promoting a plan to replace white people with immigrants of color. The video was taken from the White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism on Feb. 17, 2015, near the end of the Obama-Biden presidential administration. A longer video of the event is available via C-SPAN.:Based on that evidence, we confirmed that the viral short clip circulating on social media in 2023 was authentic; it wasn't digitally edited to make it seem like Biden said something that he hadn't (learn tips for spotting deepfakes) .At around the 10:20 mark in the C-SPAN video, Biden said:An unrelenting stream of immigration, nonstop, nonstop. Folks like me who were Caucasian, of European descent for the first time in 2017 will be in an absolute minority in the United States of America, absolute minority. Fewer than 50 percent of the people in America from then and on will be White European stock. That's not a bad thing. That's a source of our strength.That passage circulated out of context in 2023 and as such, did not accurately represent Biden's full point at the event. In a roundabout way, Biden appeared to be connecting American inclusion of immigrants of all backgrounds and ethnicities to the need to counter violent extremism without exclusionary tactics, arguing for giving opportunities and hope to immigrants so they would not be radicalized. :""We are a nation of immigrants. That's who we are,"" he said. Before he made the in-question comment about expected 2017 demographic changes, he observed, ""It started all the way back in the late 1700s. So there's been a constant, unrelenting stream of immigration, not in little trickles, but in large numbers."" At one point, he referenced discrimination he said his Irish ancestors faced while trying to get jobs in the U.S., with potential employers displaying signs reading, ""No Irish need apply,"" as well as ""the anti-Catholic movements of the know-nothings in the 1800s.""At no point in the speech did he say that white people should be replaced by immigrants of color, nor did he give any indication that there was an ongoing, or soon-to-be announced policy initiative to make that happen. Given that the clip was pulled out of context, ignoring Biden's surrounding remarks praising the diversity of the U.S. population, as well as the fact that it does not show him promoting an alleged agenda to replace ""White Americans"" with immigrants of color, we rate this claim as ""False."" :"
201,201,361.TotalNonsenseQAnonHe,"Controversial pro-Trump attorney Lin Wood caused consternation among some QAnon followers over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, when he posted evidence online that appeared to show that retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General Michael Flynn -- a leading public supporter of the sprawling, baseless conspiracy theory -- privately regarded it as ""total nonsense"" and even a deliberate CIA plot to discredit supporters of former President Donald Trump. In Telegram posts on Nov. 27, Wood characterized Flynn as a ""wolf in sheep's clothing"" who had ""played"" QAnon supporters. In what appeared to be a Nov. 3 text message exchange between the two men, Flynn appeared to write, of QAnon: ""I have always believe[d] it is a set up and a disinformation campaign to make people look like a bunch of kooks."" The same text message, purportedly written by Flynn, included a link to a Nov. 2 column in which the notorious right-wing commentator Hal Turner described QAnon as ""bullshit,"" and said its most loyal adherents had been ""treated like garbage and made to look like a fool in front of the entire world."":Later, Wood posted a 16-minute audio recording of what appeared to be a phone conversation between himself and Flynn. In it, Flynn appears to describe QAnon as ""total nonsense"" and a ""disinformation campaign"" created by ""the Left"" or the CIA. In an email, Wood confirmed for Snopes that he himself had personally published those Nov. 27 posts.Snopes has not yet been able to verify the authenticity of the text message screenshots or audio recording, and Flynn's attorney Sidney Powell did not respond to a list of questions in time for publication. Although not directly relevant the Nov. 27 audio file, Wood has recently published recordings of other phone calls, which have been verified as authentic. Flynn was an early Trump supporter who briefly served as his national security advisor before he was forced to resign in February 2017, when it emerged he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. In December 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about those contacts, but Trump later pardoned him before leaving office. :Perceived as a victim of ""deep state"" persecution and corruption, Flynn had been regarded as something of a hero among QAnon followers, and has embraced the language and symbolism of that movement. The possibility that Flynn had, in reality, ""always believed"" QAnon was ""total nonsense,"" has not gone down well among some adherents.""QAnon John,"" an influential promoter of the conspiracy theories, who had lavished praise upon Flynn as recently as August, appeared to have broken from the former general, writing ""I stand with Lin"" and ""It's become clear to me that things may not be as they once seemed...Some of the loyalty and allegiance I had for years is now tarnished.""Similarly, David Clements, a prominent supporter of debunked conspiracy theories about the role of electoral fraud in President Joe Biden's 2020 win, wrote on Telegram: ""I recognize great pain is being experienced as new revelations come to pass. I am as heartbroken as you are at the division.  No one likes being deceived.  And no one likes being the instrument of someone else's deception."":Previously, Clements had declared his love and admiration for Flynn. 'I'm Tired of These QAnon People' Attorneys L. Lin Wood (C) and Mark Stephen (L) speak to the media about their client, British rescue diver Vernon Unsworth (rear), as they arrive at US District Court on December 3, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Apu Gomes/Getty Images):As well as sending shockwaves around the QAnon movement, the apparent Flynn phone call highlights the divisions and infighting that have beset the movement in the wake of a series of bitter losses and disillusionments: the defeat of Trump in 2020; the failure of much-vaunted efforts to overturn Biden's victory; Trump's failure to get himself reinstated to the presidency by Aug. 13, 2021; the subsequent failure of hyperpartisan election audits in various jurisdictions; and most recently, the failure of the long-deceased John F. Kennedy Jr. to materialize in Dallas, Texas, prompting Trump's return to the White House. Wood gained national prominence in the febrile months after Trump's defeat, and became something of a star in the broader campaign to ""stop the steal"" -- litigating on behalf of Trump in several states. However, the ultimate failure of those dubious legal efforts, along with Wood's promotion of increasingly bizarre conspiracy theories, and criticism from his former client, the acquitted Kenosha murder suspect Kyle Rittenhouse, have seen his star wane. In the call, which appears to have been recorded on Nov. 2, Wood appears to air a number of grievances, in particular surrounding Vernon Jones -- a long-standing Georgia Democrat who switched to the Republican party in 2020, emerging as a prominent Black supporter of Trump, and speaking at the Jan. 6, 2021, rally in Washington, D.C., which preceded the attack on the U.S. Capitol. :Flynn had endorsed Jones' campaign to challenge incumbent Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp as a Republican in 2022, while Wood had supported the less well known right-wing Republican Kandiss Taylor. In the purported phone call, Wood complains to Flynn that his erstwhile ally failed to speak out in his defense when Jones publicly criticized him: ""If somebody had called you [Flynn] un-American and a racist, I'd whip their ass. I certainly wouldn't endorse them for high office."" After further complaining to Flynn about his financial woes, Wood addresses the recent online in-fighting among ""patriots"" and ""truth-seekers,"" declaring ""I'm tired of these QAnon people attacking me."" At that point, and without requiring too much invitation, Flynn appears to disavow the movement in no uncertain terms, saying:...I think it's a disinformation campaign that the CIA created. That's what I believe, now, you know, I don't know that for a fact, but that's what I think it is. I think it's a disinformation campaign.There's actually a very interesting article today, out, that was sent to me -- I'll send it to you -- about how the QAnon movement has failed, and all that. But I find it, you know, total nonsense, and I think it's a disinformation campaign created by the Left, and the types of people that can create something like that are the kind of people that we train for certain -- you know, with certain skills, in the CIA. So I wouldn't be surprised if that's what it was. :In a Telegram post on Nov. 27, Wood appeared to extend an olive branch to several erstwhile allies and fellow travelers whom he had criticized and questioned in recent days -- Flynn and his brother Joe; pro-Trump attorney Sidney Powell; and businessman Patrick Byrne. Wood wrote:I am aware that my documented information relating to Mike Flynn, Joe Flynn, Sidney Powell, and Patrick Burn [sic] has caused consternation among the ranks of the Patriots. I have reached out by documented texts to both Mike and Sidney several times to discuss this situation with them over the last few weeks. I have had no meaningful response to date. Without question, the division presents a challenging situation at a critical time period in our nation's history.  I hereby formally invite Mike, Joe, Sidney, and Patrick to Tomotley for a face-to-face meeting so that we can amicably discuss the ""war"" between us and search for a peaceful resolution...The thaw did not last long. Just hours later, Wood wrote: ""You have been played by Michael Flynn. He is a wolf in sheep's clothing,"" and added ""Remember, Flynn is a master of deceit."": "

Kennedy, Jr. and published between 1995 and 2001. Although this issue does feature a lengthy interview with Gates, the quote featured here comes from an entirely different article. The February 1997 issue of George magazine included a ""Survival Guide to the Future"" that featured various commentators describing how the world was ""now"" and providing their thoughts on what the world would be like in 2020. The actual article, titled ""A Nation's Future Foretold,"" was divided into themed sections such as transportation, education, environment, crime, warfare, and food. The quote shown in the viral image comes from the disease section of this article. Here's a screenshot from a digital copy of the magazine, which more clearly shows the author of this text:::The end of the article comes after a page break, where you can read the pull-quote in context::Gates did not write that an ""over-populated planet"" would be ""choked to extinction by a lung-attacking virus."" This article was actually written by poet and science writer Arno Karlen. However, social media users did find an actual quote from Gates in this issue of George that they presented as equally controversial as the ""lung-attacking virus"" quote.  A second image showing an excerpt from this issue appears to show Gates talking about ""funding population control"":This, again, is a genuine image from the February 1997 issue of George magazine. And this time, it is a genuine quote from Gates. He made this comment shortly after he was asked about how he keeps his personal opinions separate from his business decisions:::While this quote is often shared as if it revealed some secret and nefarious plot from the former Microsoft CEO, the truth is a bit more mundane. This quote was widely circulated by those who adhere to the idea that Gates was using the COVID-19 pandemic to give himself an opportunity to microchip the population via vaccines. The above-displayed quote shows, according to proponents of this conspiracy theory, that Gates has long been planning to take control of the global population. We took a deeper look into the ""ID2020"" conspiracy theory here.However, the term ""population control"" isn't as literal as it may seem in this context. This term was widely used in the 1970s and '80s, but it fell out of fashion in the '90s and was replaced by terms such as ""reproductive health,"" ""family planning,"" and ""women's empowerment.""In writing about the United Nations International Conference on Population and Development in 1994, the Christian Science Monitor noted a major philosophical difference between that year's conference and conferences from years past::If there is a major philosophical difference in the 1994 version of the once-a-decade international conference on population, it is the shift from ""population control"" to ""women's empowerment"" -- especially in areas of reproductive health, education, and economic opportunities, which planners of the UN conference see as closely linked to fertility rates.""Economic growth and improvement of quality of life have been fastest in those areas where women have higher status, and slowest where they face the greatest disadvantages,"" states the draft ""Programme of Action"" now being debated in New York.Gates' quote in this 1997 interview may have been a bit outdated, but it was not indicative of a nefarious plot to enslave humankind. Rather, Gates was noting his charitable work with global organizations that support reproductive health programs. For example, in 1997, the year this interview was published, the Gates Foundation awarded a $2.2 million grant to Johns Hopkins University to ""support the Institute for Population and Reproductive Health to strengthen leadership and institutions in the developing countries."" Two years later in 1999, Bill and Melinda Gates donated $2.2 billion to United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).:Forbes explored Gates' thinking on ""population control"" in a 2011 profile:That same epiphany for his public health philanthropy came even earlier. Bill's dad had set up a dinner at Seattle's posh Columbia Tower Club with the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH). While the meeting started with birth control -- among other efforts, PATH taught Chinese condom makers to test their products before shipping them -- Gates began consuming data that startled him. In society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls -- specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people -- the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes. ""It goes against common sense,"" Gates says. Most parents don't choose to have eight children because they want to have big families, it turns out, but because they know many of their children will die.""If a mother and father know their child is going to live to adulthood, they start to naturally reduce their population size,"" says Melinda.In terms of giving, Gates did a 180-degree turn. Rather than prevent births, he would aim his billions at saving the kids already born. ""We moved pretty heavily into vaccines once we understood that,"" says Gates.:"

204,204,52.CopUnsatisfiedwithRe,"Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone has expressed disappointment with the response he received from U.S. Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-California, during a sought-after meeting between McCarthy and police officers who defended the U.S. Capitol from a deadly attack by pro-Trump rioters on Jan. 6, 2021.Exiting the meeting in McCarthy's Capitol office on June 25, 2021, Fanone said he asked McCarthy to denounce conspiracy theories and lies about the attack on the Capitol, in which Fanone and roughly 140 police officers from the Metro police department and U.S. Capitol Police were injured, some seriously.Fanone told reporters that during the meeting, he had asked McCarthy to denounce 21 House Republicans who voted ""no"" on awarding the police officers who defended the Capitol the Congressional Gold Medal. He said he asked McCarthy to denounce statements by U.S. Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Georgia, in which Clyde compared the attackers to tourists.Fanone also said he asked McCarthy to publicly denounced the baseless claim that the Capitol attack was organized by the FBI. On June 15, 2021, Fox News host Tucker Carlson prominently promoted that conspiracy theory.:""The FBI is the best investigative agency that we have in this country,"" Fanone said.

206,206,523.WasaFarRightActivist,"Claim:Tommy Robinson was jailed in order to silence his reporting on a sex abuse trial in England, and to ""protect Muslim pedophiles.""Rating:FalseAbout this rating English far-right activist Tommy Robinson was given a 13-month prison sentence on 25 May 2018, following a Facebook Live video he broadcast from outside a trial of several men accused of a range of child sexual abuse offenses. The sentence prompted a wave of outrage and protests (mostly, but not entirely, among various factions of the far right) and claims that Robinson's rights to free speech were being violated in the interests of political correctness; Robinson stated in the video that many of the defendants were Muslim. :On 28 May 2018, the ""alternative medicine"" and conspiracy theory site NaturalNews.com claimed that Robinson had been silenced without due process in order to ""protect Muslim pedophiles"" because ""the UK government is run by criminal pedophiles who rely on Muslim pedo networks to provide a steady supply of nine and ten-year-old little girls and boys."" Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones described the episode as ""historic"" and his Infowars web site called the arrest of Robinson ""the beginning of the end for free speech in Europe.""These claims are based on a wild misunderstanding of a very basic principle in the legal system of England and Wales, and of other parts of the U.K. Far from being a ""historic"" violation of due process, Robinson was jailed because a court judged he had breached the terms of an existing suspended sentence for contempt of court by violating a set of reporting restrictions often placed on the news media and others in the United Kingdom in order to protect the due process rights of defendants and prevent the collapse of trials, something that could jeopardize the conviction of potentially guilty and dangerous individuals. The ""media blackout"" on the child sexual abuse trial referred to by NaturalNews.com was not designed to ""protect Muslim pedophiles,"" but rather to protect the integrity of the child sexual abuse trial itself, prevent a costly re-trial, and avoid witnesses having to go through the trauma of testifying in court again.:Reporting restrictions such as those imposed in the child sexual abuse case in question are temporary, meaning that the news media can reveal previously-censored details after the trial has concluded. So Robinson was not jailed for engaging in journalism, or for merely reporting on alleged criminality. He was jailed for violating a court order, breaching the terms of an existing suspended sentence, and potentially risking the collapse of an ongoing trial. BackgroundIn May 2017, Robinson -- the founder of the far-right, conspiracy-mongering English Defence League, and whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon -- was arrested for contempt of court after filming inside Canterbury Crown Court in the south-eastern English county of Kent. As reported by Kent Online at the time, Robinson pleaded guilty to contempt and apologized. He had confronted some of the defendants inside the court building as they left while filming footage which he later uploaded online. Robinson accused police of helping the defendants ""escape."":In sentencing him on 26 May 2017, Judge Heather Norton said:This is not about free speech... not about the freedom of the Press, nor about legitimate journalism, and not about political correctness. It is about justice and ensuring that a trial can be carried out justly and fairly..it's about being innocent until proven guilty. It is about preserving the integrity of the jury to continue without people being intimidated..or being affected by irresponsible and inaccurate ""reporting"", if that's what it was. ...You made it abundantly clear that your mission was to film the defendants, who you referred to by their religion, as 'Muslim child rapists' and 'Muslim paedophiles'....I take a very dim view of your conduct, which was in the face of repeated warnings...There are notices all over the court building making it clear that filming or taking a photograph was an offence and may be a contempt of court. You were told very clearly by the security staff at this court that you were to stop filming.Robinson was given a three-month prison sentence, but it was suspended for 18 months on the condition that he did not commit any more criminal offenses. :The Facebook Live videoA year later, on 25 May 2018, Robinson showed up outside Leeds Crown Court in the northern English county of Yorkshire and began broadcasting a Facebook Live video.In the video, Robinson confronted men whom he presented as defendants in an ongoing child sexual abuse case, made it clear it was his aim to identify them and show their faces on camera, named several men and listed the purported charges against them, and in one instance encouraged the ""mainstream media"" to harass a man he had earlier shown on camera, as he arrived in court. According to the Hull Daily Mail, some of the charges Robinson associated with named defendants were inaccurate. That type of factual error -- broadcast to a potentially huge audience  -- could have serious consequences in a criminal trial. During the course of the 75-minute video, Robinson openly declared ""there is a reporting restriction on this case,"" acknowledged that he was already on a suspended sentence for contempt of court and said ""I have to be super-careful."":The closing moments of the video showed police arresting Robinson outside the court for breach of the peace, a public order offense. Later that day, Judge Geoffrey Marson of Leeds Crown Court gave Robinson a 13-month prison sentence for contempt of court and violating his existing suspended sentence, ruling that the content of his Facebook Live video had the potential to prejudice and collapse the ongoing trial. Robinson had pleaded guilty. According to LeedsLive, Marson watched the Facebook video in court before telling Robinson: No one could possibly conclude that it [the video] would be anything other than highly prejudicial to the defendants in the trial. I respect everyone's right to free speech. That's one of the most important rights that we have. With those rights come responsibilities. The responsibility to exercise that freedom of speech within the law. I am not sure you appreciate the potential consequence of what you have done....You have to understand we are not preventing publication. We are postponing publication to ensure that the trial is fair.:The Hull Daily Mail quoted Marson as giving concrete examples of the harm that Robinson's video had the potential to cause:If the jurors in my present trial get to know of this video I will no doubt be faced with an application to discharge the jury.  If I have to do that it will mean a re-trial, costing hundreds and hundreds and thousands of pounds. A re-trial would also mean witnesses in the case would have to face the ordeal of giving evidence again before a jury.Marson placed reporting restrictions on Robinson's arrest and sentencing, but those restrictions were lifted after a successful application by LeedsLive on 29 May. In a textbook example of how reporting restrictions postpone but do not prohibit acts of journalism, local and national news media honored Marson's order over the weekend and refrained from reporting on Robinson's sentencing until the order was lifted. The reporting restrictions in the child sexual abuse case remain in place. :Strict rulesThe UK news media faces strict rules on what they can and cannot publish about an ongoing trial. Some of these are in place by default, while others require a court order and are at the discretion of judges.For example, the complainant, or victim, in a sexual assault case cannot be named, unless they waive their automatic right to anonymity, but it might require a court order for the media to be restrained from publishing the identity of -- for example -- a minor or a vulnerable witness.Guidelines in place in the UK state that a judge can postpone, but not prohibit, the publication of otherwise ""fair and accurate reports."" The overarching principle in place is to avoid the publication of anything which ""creates a substantial risk of serious prejudice to the administration of justice"" if it is published during a trial.In particular, judges are sensitive to the publication of even accurate news reports in circumstances where two separate trials are linked. In that way, the ""prejudice"" being avoided can relate to the same trial or a future trial involving the same defendants or complainants, or relating to the same events or circumstances.:"
207,207,187.DidtheDHSFindThat12M,"Claim:The U.S. Department of Homeland Security found 12 million-plus votes for Donald Trump that weren't counted.Rating:FalseAbout this rating A meme that contained a claim from the 2016 U.S. presidential-election cycle suddenly began circulating on Facebook in late January 2019, a product of a feature that allows users to apply a brightly-colored background and large font to status updates::The meme's claim was an apparent holdover from the election in which President Donald Trump won an electoral college victory, securing him the White House, but lost the popular vote to his opponent, Hillary Clinton, by a margin of almost 2.9 million votes. This disparity prompted a prominent but baseless conspiracy theory that non-citizens had illegally cast millions of ballots for Clinton -- a conspiracy theory that Trump himself promoted::In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016Once in office, Trump continued to pursue the claim, going so far as to create a commission that was eventually disbanded after having found no evidence of large-scale voter fraud.As is often the case with Facebook-generated memes, it cited no sources cited and no reference to where the information it presented came from. We were unable to locate any DHS material that disclosed the department's discovery of 12 million uncounted votes, and our query to the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) press team asking about the claim did not receive a response.After Trump disbanded the voter-fraud commission, the White House stated he had ""asked the Department of Homeland Security to review its [the commission's] initial findings and determine next courses of action."" But shortly after that statement was released, Reuters reported that multiple ""officials and sources familiar with the matter said they were unaware of plans within DHS, a sprawling agency responsible for a wide array of national security issues, to investigate voter fraud."":Although one would expect the finding of 12 million-plus uncounted votes for Trump to hit the news cycle like a tornado, no such reporting has emerged. In December 2018, DHS did release a study stating that as of January 2015, an estimated 12 million undocumented people resided in the U.S. Other news stories in which the figure ""12 million"" appeared included reports that Democratic lawmakers lost seats in the U.S. Senate despite securing 12 million more votes in aggregate than Republicans during the 2018 midterm elections. But none of those stories was related to the discovery of 12 million uncounted votes.The very premise of this claim is also fairly implausible. Were the 12 million uncounted Trump ballots that had been tabulated but not reported? If so, what precinct or jurisdiction could have experienced a whopping 12-million-plus vote undercount without its having been noticed until years after the fact -- a number that is greater that the entire number of ballots cast in any single state other than California? If the 12 million uncounted Trump votes were ballots that had not been tabulated, then how could someone have obtained tens of millions of uncounted ballots, sifted through them to pluck out all the Trump votes, and returned the rest to the counting stream, all to deadline and without detection?:It remains unclear whether the meme simply attempted to shift the original story line from ""millions of undocumented people voted for Clinton in 2016"" to ""12 million votes were stolen from Trump in 2016."" However, we have located no evidence that the meme was based on any facts."

Almost immediately after his name was made public, social media users, apparently inspired by nothing more than a Spanish-sounding surname, began spreading an unfounded claim that he is an undocumented DACA recipient. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program gives people who were brought into the United States as young children temporary authorization to remain legally and DACA recipients are often referred to as Dreamers after proposed legislation.: However Cruz was adopted as a small child, along with his younger brother, by a couple with that surname and is not undocumented.Here are examples of such unverified claims that spread on social media in the hours after the tragedy::Source: Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooter, now in police custody after Parkland, Florida shooting, who has been identified as 19-year-old Nicolas Cruz - is a ""Dreamer"".-- Craig R.

At the time of the shooting, lawmakers had been debating about immigration as a whole and the DACA program in particular, going so far as to shut down the government over the issue.Cruz's immigration status, of course, is a distraction that has no relation to the tragedy. In the 24-hour period since the shooting, potentially pertinent details of his life began surfacing including disturbing social media posts showing him posing with weapons and depicting acts of animal cruelty. He had been expelled from Douglas High School the preceding year for disciplinary issues. Douglas High students said they had believed, due to his troubling behavior, that if anyone was going to open fire at the school it would be Cruz. He had legally purchased an AR-15 firearm about a year ago.:The unfounded claim that Cruz is a DACA recipient was hardly the only piece of false information circulating on social media in the immediate aftermath of the incident. A now-restricted Twitter account falsely purporting to belong to former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly spread a false image of a person who is not the suspect (the image's presence on message boards like 4chan predates the shooting)::The same account (along with others) perpetuated a long-standing hoax, once again blaming ""Sam Hyde"" for the shooting::"
209,209,513.DidClintonSupporters,"Claim:Hillary Clinton and/or members of her 2008 presidential campaign started the ""birther"" movement questioning whether Barack Obama was born in the U.S.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 16 September 2016, after years of being the most visible and outspoken exponent of ""birtherism"" -- the notion that, despite all evidence to the contrary, Barack Obama was born outside the U.S. and thus his presidency is illegitimate and his allegiances suspect -- GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump stepped up to the podium at a televised campaign event and completely reversed his stance on the matter -- but not before trying to lay blame for the long, drawn-out smear campaign on someone else.:""Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it,"" Trump said. ""President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period.""A press release issued by Trump's campaign staff elaborated on the accusation:Hillary Clinton's campaign first raised this issue to smear then-candidate Barack Obama in her very nasty, failed 2008 campaign for President. This type of vicious and conniving behavior is straight from the Clinton Playbook. As usual, however, Hillary Clinton was too weak to get an answer. Even the MSNBC show Morning Joe admits that it was Clinton's henchmen who first raised this issue, not Donald J. Trump.In 2011, Mr. Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate. Mr. Trump did a great service to the President and the country by bringing closure to the issue that Hillary Clinton and her team first raised. Inarguably, Donald J. Trump is a closer. Having successfully obtained President Obama's birth certificate when others could not, Mr. Trump believes that President Obama was born in the United States.The statement is correct when it suggests that the claim that Hillary Clinton invented birtherism isn't new. It had been made in 2015, for example, on the MSNBC Morning Joe program::Though it's true that the specific allegation that Obama wasn't born in the U.S. first reared its head during the 2008 presidential race, rumblings about Obama's ""otherness"" had been percolating since long before that. In 2004, a political gadfly named Andy Martin issued a press release calling Barack Obama a ""complete fraud"" who had ""misrepresented his heritage"" in his memoir, Dreams From My Father, and ""is a Muslim who has concealed his religion."" The theme was pushed further in December 2006 by conservative columnist Debbie Schlussel, who published an article entitled ""Barack Hussein Obama: Once a Muslim, Always a Muslim,"" which stated that ""Obama has a 'born-again' affinity for the nation of his Muslim father, Kenya."" In March 2007, Clinton campaign strategist Mark Penn proposed attacking Obama on the basis of his ""lack of American roots."" And, in December 2007, a Clinton volunteer county coordinator in Iowa was fired for forwarding an e-mail making the by-then familiar claim that Obama is a Muslim.:The idea that Obama was born elsewhere, specifically Kenya, was first floated in April 2008, according to a 22 April 2011 Politico article by Ben Smith and Byron Tau on the origins of birtherism:That theory first emerged in the spring of 2008, as Clinton supporters circulated an anonymous e-mail questioning Obama's citizenship.""Barack Obama's mother was living in Kenya with his Arab-African father late in her pregnancy. She was not allowed to travel by plane then, so Barack Obama was born there and his mother then took him to Hawaii to register his birth,"" asserted one chain email that surfaced on the urban legend site Snopes.com in April 2008.That Hillary Clinton supporters circulated such an e-mail isn't in question, but the claim that that's the moment the birther theory ""first emerged"" simply isn't true. The likeliest point of origin we've been able to find was a post on conservative message board FreeRepublic.com dated 1 March 2008 (which, according to a report in The Telegraph, was at least a month before Clinton supporters got on the e-mail bandwagon)::I was told today that Obama swore in on a Koran for his Senate seat. I do not believe he did. Can someone clarify this for me? I am under the impression only a Congressman has so far sworn in on a Koran.Also that Obama's mother gave birth to him overseas and then immediately flew into Hawaii and registered his birth as having taken place in Hawaii.Again, any clarifications on this? Defintely disqualifies him for Prez. There must be some trace of an airticket. While small babies are not charged air fare they do have a ticket issued for them.Long time ago but there may be some residual information somewhere. Good ammo (if available and true) BEST USED AFTER he becomes PREZ (if that occurs) and it's too late for Dems - except accept the VP.The same rumor was repeated, with elaborations, four days later on the conservative blog Ruthless Roundup:Add to the family history shown in this article that Obama's mother was allegedly visiting Kenya with Obama's father in the final months of her pregnancy and was not allowed to board a flight in her late term to return home.She allegedly had Obama in Kenya and quickly boarded a flight to Hawaii. Airlines do not accept late term pregancies but do not refuse passage to a newborn, usually issuing a 10% or free fare ticket for the trip.Once in Hawaii, his mother registered him as being born in Hawaii.:The conspiracy theory was already fully formed at this point. Clearly, the Clinton supporters accused of spreading it via forwarded e-mails knew ""good ammo"" when they saw it, but, as the above posts show, they deserve neither credit nor blame for the invention of birtherism.

Go to bed. -- Teresa Barnwell (@teresa_barnwell) September 12, 2016Many speculated that a lack of Secret Service agents in view around the candidate was a clear indicator that the Clinton spotted later that day was an impostor. However, if that unprotected ""Hillary Clinton"" were seriously wounded or killed by an assassin, it would be impossible for the real Clinton to recover from the subterfuge and go on to win the 2016 election, so the risk of fallout from such a large cover-up would far outweigh the benefits of Clinton's faking a ""body double"" reappearance on 11 September 2016.:It also doesn't require a denial from Teresa Barnwell to determine she was not the woman depicted in the 11 September 2016 footage of Clinton following her early exit from a 9/11 memorial event. Whether Clinton looked the same in the two photosets is a subjective assessment, but video and photographs of the subsequent appearance reveal a woman who is clearly not Teresa Barnwell. There is no way the two women could be confused for each other, given their clear facial dissimilarities."
211,211,564.DidtheCDCSignificant,"Claim:The CDC readjusted the COVID-19 death toll from 60,000 down to 37,000.Rating:FalseAbout this rating At the beginning of May 2020, widely circulated social media posts asserted that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had substantially revised their figures for the number of deaths in the U.S. caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, from 60,000 down to about 37,000::These posts fed into conspiracy theories holding that the COVID-19 pandemic was not nearly as serious as suggested by the government and the news media, and that the ""true"" mortality figures were being deceptively inflated to achieve some ulterior purpose.However, this claim was not true, and it was the result of comparing two separate data sources that report different measurements.:The link included in the above tweet points to the CDC's Provisional Death Counts for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) page, which provides provisional death totals by week and state according to the following criteria:The provisional data presented on this page include the weekly provisional count of deaths in the United States due to COVID-19, deaths from all causes and percent of expected deaths (i.e., number of deaths received over number of deaths expected based on data from previous years), pneumonia deaths (excluding pneumonia deaths involving influenza), pneumonia deaths involving COVID-19, influenza deaths, and deaths involving pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19; (a) by week ending date and (b) by specific jurisdictions.As of May 1, 2020, that page reported the total number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. as being 37,308::However, that page also notes that the provisional data it displays are continually revised, may be incomplete, likely will not include more recent deaths, and may differ from other published sources because data currently are lagged by an average of 1-2 weeks:The provisional counts for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) deaths are based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia that have been received and coded as of the date specified. It is important to note that it can take several weeks for death records to be submitted to National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), processed, coded, and tabulated. Therefore, the data shown on this page may be incomplete, and will likely not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period, especially for the more recent time periods. Death counts for earlier weeks are continually revised and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received from the states by NCHS. COVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1-2 weeks.:Provisional death counts may not match counts from other sources, such as media reports or numbers from county health departments. Our counts often track 1-2 weeks behind other data for a number of reasons: Death certificates take time to be completed. There are many steps involved in completing and submitting a death certificate. Waiting for test results can create additional delays. States report at different rates. Currently, 63% of all U.S. deaths are reported within 10 days of the date of death, but there is significant variation among jurisdictions. It takes extra time to code COVID-19 deaths. While 80% of deaths are electronically processed and coded by NCHS within minutes, most deaths from COVID-19 must be coded manually, which takes an average of 7 days. Other reporting systems use different definitions or methods for counting deaths.That 37,308 was not a drastic downward revision of any previously reported death total.  Rather, it only might have seemed such because it was mistakenly compared to the number of deaths reported on the CDC's COVID-19 Cases in the U.S. page, which as of May 3, 2020, displayed a total of 65,735 deaths::Why such a large discrepancy?  Because as latter page's ""About the Data"" section explains, its data are updated daily based on ""Case notifications received by CDC from U.S. public health jurisdictions and the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS)"" and includes ""both confirmed and probable deaths.""  This more up-to-date page will obviously report higher death figures that one whose data lag by 1-2 weeks.  Indeed, two weeks earlier, the ""Cases in the U.S."" page had displayed a total of 35,443 deaths, a number much closer to the 37,308 figure reported by the ""Provisional Death Counts"" with its 1-2 week data lag.In short, this claim is like comparing stock prices from a two-week-old newspaper with those offered today by a cable news station, and then attributing any differences to a conspiracy rather than the mere passage of time as reflected in more current reporting."

It's unclear if the tanks were meant for the Obamas, the U.S. Secret Service, or for another purpose.We reviewed earlier reporting about the application for the propane tanks from both Miami Standard and The Martha's Vineyard Times, also known as MVTimes.com. On June 7, 2022, The MV Times published the following::The select board approved a request for a 2,500-gallon commercial propane tank for 79 Turkeyland Cove Road in Katama -- owned by former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. ""We've never had a private propane tank come to us,"" said select board member Arthur Smadbeck, with select board member Michael Donaroma noting a private-residence propane tank is typically a fraction of the quantity being requested. To confirm the reporting, we contacted the Town of Edgartown Selectboard in Massachusetts. The town is located on Martha's Vineyard. By phone, we requested the minutes from the Selectboard's meeting on June 6, as they weren't yet available on the board's website.We received the board's minutes by email. According to the two-page document, a single, 2,500-gallon propane tank was discussed by the board for a street address matching the Obamas' Martha's Vineyard property. The agenda item was introduced by the board's chairman, Margaret E. Serpa:Ms. Serpa then addressed the next item which was an application from Star Propane to install a buried 2500g tank at 79 Turkeyland Cove.Mr. Smadbeck moved to approve. Mr. Donaroma seconded. Unanimous.:The minutes contained no additional information.We again inquired with the board by email, asking if the purpose of the propane was public knowledge or if they had any other information that could be passed along. In response, they sent the application for the tanks that had been signed on May 31, 2022. The application showed that a request had been made for three propane tanks, including two sized at 1,000 gallons and another one at 500 gallons. The name of the person who made the request was Ashley Tate-Gilmore. A person with the same name previously served as Obama's White House travel director.The news of the propane tanks led to a number of videos that pushed a conspiracy theory that the Obamas made the purchase for ""prepping."" The conspiracy theory referred to the idea of preparing for a future and potentially apocalyptic turn of events, in particular a financial collapse. At the time, the Federal Reserve had sought to ""tame high inflation"" by putting forth its ""largest rate hike since 1994,"" according to The Associated Press. This led to fears of a possible future recession, the reporting said.:In sum, an application was submitted to the Town of Edgartown for three propane tanks equalling a total of 2,500-gallon capacity that were to be installed above ground on the Obamas' property on Martha's Vineyard. The purpose of the tanks was unclear."
213,213,444.JohnLewisAvoidedPayi,"Claim:Congressman John Lewis didn't pay property taxes on his townhouse in Washington, D.C.Rating:UnprovenAbout this rating On 18 January 2017, web site GotNews posted an article reporting that U.S. Rep. John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat who is perhaps most famous for participating in the Civil Rights Movement at the side of Martin Luther King, Jr., didn't pay property taxes on a $1 million townhouse located in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Washington, D.C.::Trump-hating Democratic Georgia congressman John Lewis didn't pay property taxes on his nearly $1 million fancy Washington, D.C. townhouse on Capitol Hill, despite being in Congress for decades, where the salary for a Representative starts at $174,000 per year.Lewis was in the news recently for saying he doesn't see President-elect Donald J. Trump as ""a legitimate president"" because of the #RussianHackers Democratic conspiracy theory.The article displayed a table showing annual property tax payments for the home in question and a legal notice from 2010 alerting Lewis of a court action against him (the case was later dismissed). It's unclear how this table supposedly documents that Lewis ""didn't pay property taxes on his nearly $1 million fancy Washington, D.C. townhouse,"" given that it lists tax payments due on the property for each of the last several years and shows nothing owing other than the most recent payment (for the last half of 2016)::Moreover, a different view from the same D.C. Office of Tax and Revenue web site shows that the taxes on Lewis' property have indeed been collected, as due, for each of the last several years::We contacted Lewis's spokeswoman, Brenda Jones, who told us that he bought the home years before property values soared, that he still owns it, and that he is not behind on his taxes:He pays property taxes annually, just as all homeowners in DC do, and his taxes are paid and up to date.  Any report that he ""avoids"" paying taxes grasps at straws and is a desperate and unnecessary attempt to tarnish his credibility, instead of debating the substance of issues he has raised.Neither the home in question, nor any properties under Lewis' name, appeared on a database search of properties seized and placed on sale for failure to pay property taxes.A second item of alleged proof offered by GotNews.com was a 2010 ""notice of pendency of action,"" a legal notice of court actions relating to real property. The document appears to be a notice of a foreclosure hearing. That case, however, was dismissed on 11 February 2011::According to current public records available as of 19 January 2017, Lewis still owns the property, confirming that the case was dropped. It was purchased in 1988 (for an unknown price) and is currently valued at $865,790.An explanation offered by Lewis's office states that in 2010 he nearly lost his home to foreclosure but was able to stop the process:Rep. Lewis's Washington, DC property was purchased decades ago for a fraction of its current value today. As most Washingtonians and any real property expert know, property values in the city have risen exponentially in the last 10 to15 years. Rep. Lewis is delighted that he made a wise investment years ago, and that his property's value has skyrocketed. He also realizes he likely could not afford to purchase his own home were he seeking to buy it today. In 2010, he was subjected to attempts to foreclose upon his home, like many Americans during that period. He is fortunate that he was able to stop that process, though many Americans, including many hundreds of his constituents, were not as successful. His property taxes are paid and currently up to date.:"
214,214,642.WereBonesofChildrenF,"Claim:The FBI discovered bones of young children in the waters around the late billionaire Jeffrey Epstein's private island.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In August 2019, Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire money manager who stood accused of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls, died in a Manhattan federal jail while awaiting trial. Epstein's death, reported as a suicide, drove a whole new wave of conspiracy theories about the man who allegedly recruited numerous young girls for sexual abuse at his homes in New York and Palm Beach.:Many of those conspiracy theories focused on Little St. James, a 72-acre private island Epstein owned in the U.S. Virgin Islands that had supposedly been dubbed ""Pedophile Island"" and ""Orgy Island"" by locals. In particular, one theory spread via social media held that ""bones of children have been found on Epstein's island"" and questioned ""why isn't this headlines on every major network?""::As is usually the case, the answer to the question of why this seemingly momentous piece of information hasn't been reported by reputable news organizations is because it isn't true.This rumor appears to have originated with an article published a few days after Epstein's death by WhatDoesItMean.com, a notorious purveyor of conspiracy-based junk news:FBI Divers Recover Human Bones in Waters Off Epstein ""Orgy Island"" as ""Deep State"" Meltdown AcceleratesA beyond shocking highly classified ""Of Special Importance"" new Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today noting that the American prison system has sunk to third world status -- as even Mexico provided video of drug lord El Chapo's prison escape -- states the fury and humiliation over the death of child sex slaver Jeffrey Epstein seething through a US Department of Justice (DoJ) responsible for his staying alive to stand trial, has now been met by an ""appalled and angry"" US Attorney General William Barr -- who yesterday vowed ""no one complicit in Epstein's crimes will escape punishment""-- crimes which now may include murder after an elite team of FBI investigators and divers invaded Epstein's ""Orgy Island"" fortress in the Caribbean yesterday -- whose most stunning discovery are believed to be human bones of young children found in the waters below Epstein's satanic temple.:According to the portions of this highly classified report we're permitted to reveal, in mid-July the FBI requested a temporary export permit from the Foreign Ministry for an advanced underground radar system -- a request granted under standard permit protocols stating that such goods and technology exported must always be controlled by a Russian entity -- and in this case was a SVR expert technologist able to operate the world's most advanced underground radar system used exclusively by the Russian military which can recognize ferrous metal and non-ferrous metals at depths up to 5 meters called the Deep-Earth Metal Detector MG-1 -- who after being directed by the FBI to probe the exterior grounds of Epstein's satanic temple, saw this advanced underground radar system detecting an approximate 1 meter (about 3 feet) tubular metal pipe extending from the base of this satanic temple and disappearing into the waters below it -- after which FBI divers began bringing up from these waters what appeared to be small human bones and skulls this SVR expert technologist likened to those one would see coming from the graves of young children.As RationalWiki notes, WhatDoesItMean.com articles are attributed to ""Sorcha Faal,"" whose shtick is presenting shocking and secret information unreported by any legitimate news outlets, which ""Sorcha Faal"" has supposedly obtained from Russian government and intelligence sources::Sorcha Faal is the alleged author of an ongoing series of ""reports"" published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don't think much of it.Each report resembles a news story in its style, but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality (e.g. ""American Rebel Forces Attack Gas Pipelines, Explode Trains As US Civil War Nears""[8]) and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service in the same article) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don't contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish. The author also has the habit of adding unnecessary links to the websites of the various Russian institutions they mention.The FBI had reportedly raided Epstein's estate on Little St. James just before the salacious WhatDoesItMean.com article was published, but agents did not disclose finding any human bones (adult or otherwise) on or around the island::FBI agents -- accompanied by Customs personnel, local police and New York City officers, according to a Virgin Islands source -- fanned out in golf carts across Epstein's estate on Little St. James Island. They scooped up evidence just two days after Epstein was found dead in his jail cell of an apparent suicide while in federal custody in Manhattan.Epstein, 66, was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City, one day after a federal court unsealed nearly 2,000 pages of Epstein-related documents that offered sordid details of the alleged trafficking of girls by the financier and his ex-girlfriend and purported madam, Ghislaine Maxwell.The documents alleged a conspiracy that took place over a number of years in the early- to mid-2000s, with Epstein's island -- and his waterfront estate in Palm Beach -- as frequent backdrops.In one record, a butler described an interaction he'd had with a 15-year-old au pair who came to the United States from Sweden. The butler, who like the au pair worked for two of Epstein's close friends, said she had been taken to the private island and ordered to have sex with Epstein and others. In his sworn statement, the butler said that the girl, distraught and sobbing, told him that Epstein and Maxwell had physically threatened her and taken her passport to keep her on the island.:In other sworn testimony, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, one of Epstein's victims, said that Epstein once held a dinner for Bill Clinton on the island. The former president, who has acknowledged traveling multiple times on Epstein's private jet, has denied ever being on Little St. James.The false WhatDoesItMean.com report about the discovery of children's bones around Epstein's private island was then amplified by the usual methods, through social media posts and videos that repeated its false claims without informing viewers about the source and unreliability of those claims:Children's bones were found under water by FBI divers next to Epstein's Pedo island.#PedoGate, #PizzaGate & #PedoWood are real.

215,215,599.WasaTrumpOrganizatio,"Claim:Experts confirmed a computer server linked to Donald Trump ""was communicating with Russia.""Rating:UnprovenAbout this rating On 31 October 2016 Slate published an article with the headline ""Was a Trump Server Communicating With Russia?."" The inquisitive title introduced a lengthy article and a mish-mash of circumstantial details positing that Donald Trump maintained ""secretive"" financial ties to Russia which came to light in the course of an unofficial investigation::In late spring, this community of malware hunters placed itself in a high state of alarm. Word arrived that Russian hackers had infiltrated the servers of the Democratic National Committee, an attack persuasively detailed by the respected cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. The computer scientists posited a logical hypothesis, which they set out to rigorously test: If the Russians were worming their way into the DNC, they might very well be attacking other entities central to the presidential campaign, including Donald Trump's many servers. ""We wanted to help defend both campaigns, because we wanted to preserve the integrity of the election,"" says one of the academics, who works at a university that asked him not to speak with reporters because of the sensitive nature of his work.Earlier [in October 2016], the group of computer scientists passed [logs of the Trump server's DNS activity] to Paul Vixie. In the world of DNS experts, there's no higher authority. Vixie wrote central strands of the DNS code that makes the internet work. After studying the logs, he concluded, ""The parties were communicating in a secretive fashion. The operative word is secretive. This is more akin to what criminal syndicates do if they are putting together a project."" Put differently, the logs suggested that Trump and Alfa had configured something like a digital hotline connecting the two entities, shutting out the rest of the world, and designed to obscure its own existence. Over the summer, the scientists observed the communications trail from a distance ... While the researchers went about their work, the conventional wisdom about Russian interference in the campaign began to shift. There were reports that the Trump campaign had ordered the Republican Party to rewrite its platform position on Ukraine, maneuvering the GOP toward a policy preferred by Russia, though the Trump campaign denied having a hand in the change. Then Trump announced in an interview with the New York Times his unwillingness to spring to the defense of NATO allies in the face of a Russian invasion. Trump even invited Russian hackers to go hunting for Clinton's emails, then passed the comment off as a joke.:The article held that a ""bank in Moscow kept irregularly pinging a server registered to the Trump Organization on Fifth Avenue,"" adding that through further research the investigating parties determined ""[the activity] wasn't an attack, but a sustained relationship between a server registered to the Trump Organization and two servers registered to an entity called Alfa Bank"" and contained several asides about the unquestionable credibility of the unnamed individuals party to the project  for example:""This [investigator] is someone I know well and is very well-known in the networking community,"" said [a computer scientist]. ""When they say something about DNS, you believe them. This person has technical authority and access to data.""The independent research done by the unnamed ""community of malware hunters"" purportedly commenced in mid-2016, shortly after rumors about Russian interference in that year's election began circulating. By September 2016, Slate reported that the self-appointed investigators had begun attempting to draw interest to their research (in one instance, by posting the information to a Reddit thread). After a New York Times reporter met with a U.S.-based representative from Alfa Bank for an unspecified related story, the Slate article asserted, a Trump domain purportedly under observation ""seemed to suddenly stop working."" The researchers came to a subsequent conclusion, which the piece built upon in a remarkably far reaching manner::The computer scientists believe there was one logical conclusion to be drawn: The Trump Organization shut down the server after Alfa was told that the Times might expose the connection. [Uninvolved computer scientist Nicholas] Weaver told me the Trump domain was ""very sloppily removed."" Or as another of the researchers put it, it looked like ""the knee was hit in Moscow, the leg kicked in New York.""What the scientists amassed wasn't a smoking gun. It's a suggestive body of evidence that doesn't absolutely preclude alternative explanations. But this evidence arrives in the broader context of the campaign and everything else that has come to light: The efforts of Donald Trump's former campaign manager to bring Ukraine into Vladimir Putin's orbit; the other Trump adviser whose communications with senior Russian officials have worried intelligence officials; the Russian hacking of the DNC and John Podesta's email.The Slate article's appearance just one week prior to the November 2016 general election unsurprisingly turned heads, despite its speculative nature. On the same day, the partisan Occupy Democrats web site published an item claiming that in an ""October Surprise"" development, ABC News had uncovered ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" in payments from Russians to Trump::An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has ""numerous ties"" to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. ""The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars -- what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate --[and] be associated with Donald Trump"" says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.Many social media users exposed only to the dueling headlines were left with the impression the two reports were linked and mutually substantiating. But Occupy Democrats' ""October Surprise"" piece was originally reported by another news outlet more than one month earlier and pertained to purported business (not campaign) dealings Trump had with Russian business interests (some of whom were U.S.-based). Moreover, its editorial focus was whether Trump's potential business links to Russia would influence his foreign policy decisions; it did not suggest Trump's campaign was being bought by ""Russian payments."" The Trump campaign addressed  and denied the allegations, while Hillary Clinton immediately tweeted twice about them::It's time for Trump to answer serious questions about his ties to Russia. https://t.co/D8oSmyVAR4 pic.twitter.com/07dRyEmPjX-- Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 31, 2016Computer scientists have apparently uncovered a covert server linking the Trump Organization to a Russian-based bank. pic.twitter.com/8f8n9xMzUU-- Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) November 1, 2016Much of the content of the Slate piece came from persons unable or unwilling to disclose their identities and credentials (and were therefore unavailable for questions), but it wasn't long before cybersecurity expert Robert Graham of Errata Security tackled the claims. In a more concise and far less speculative blog post, Graham cast reams of doubt on the entire claim set and noted that a hotel marketing management company (Cendyn), not Trump, controlled the domains in question::According to this Slate article, Trump has a secret server for communicating with Russia. Even Hillary has piled onto this story ... This is nonsense. The evidence available on the Internet is that Trump neither (directly) controls the domain ""trump-email.com"", nor has access to the server. Instead, the domain was set up and controlled by Cendyn, a company that does marketing/promotions for hotels, including many of Trump's hotels. Cendyn outsources the email portions of its campaigns to a company called Listrak, which actually owns/operates the physical server in a data center in [Philadelphia].In other words, Trump's response is (minus the political bits) likely true, supported by the evidence. It's the conclusion I came to even before seeing [Trump's] response.When you view this ""secret"" server in context, surrounded by the other email servers operated by Listrak on behalf of Cendyn, it becomes more obvious what's going on ... It's Cendyn that registered and who controls the trump-email.com domain, as seen in the WHOIS information. That the Trump Organization is the registrant, but not the admin, demonstrates that Trump doesn't have direct control over it ... When the domain information was changed last September 23, it was Cendyn who did the change, not the Trump Organization. This link lists a bunch of other hotel-related domains that Cendyn likewise controls, some Trump related, some related to Trump's hotel competitors, like Hyatt and Sheraton.:Cendyn's claim they are reusing the server for some other purpose is likely true. If you are an enterprising journalist with $399 in your budget, you can find this out ... I've heard from other DNS malware researchers (names remain anonymous) who confirm they've seen lookups for ""mail1.trump-email.com"" from all over the world, especially from tools like FireEye that process lots of spam email. One person claimed that lookups started failing for them back in late June -- and thus the claim of successful responses until September are false. In other words, the ""change"" after the NYTimes queried Alfa Bank may not be because Cendyn (or Trump) changed anything, but because that was the first they checked and noticed that lookup errors were happening.That this is just normal marketing business from Cendyn and Listrak is the overwhelming logical explanation for all this. People are tempted to pull nefarious explanations out of their imaginations for things they don't understand. But for those of us with experience in this sort of thing, what we see here is a normal messed up marketing (aka. spam) system that the Trump Organization doesn't have control over. Knowing who owns and controls these servers, it's unreasonable to believe that Trump is using them for secret emails. Far from ""secret"" or ""private"" servers as Hillary claims, these servers are wide open and obvious.:Graham concluded by noting that experts consulted by Slate offered piecemeal confirmations, none adding up to a whole:But the article quotes several experts confirming the story, so how does that jibe with this blog post. The answer is that none of the experts confirmed the story.Read more carefully. None of the identified experts confirmed the story. Instead, the experts looked at pieces, and confirmed part of the story. Vixie rightly confirmed that the pattern of DNS requests came from humans, and not automated systems. Chris Davis rightly confirmed the server doesn't look like a normal email server.Neither of them, however, confirmed that Trump has a secret server for communicating with the Russians. Both of their statements are consistent with what I describe above -- that's it's a Cendyn operated server for marketing campaigns independent of the Trump Organization.Those researchers violated their principlesThe big story isn't the conspiracy theory about Trump, but that these malware researchers exploited their privileged access for some purpose other than malware research.:Graham (who concurrently affirmed on Twitter that he was supporting Clinton) supplemented his piece with several tweets providing ancillary information, as well as comment from peers in the field of cybersecurity:Because journalists are good at tricking ""experts"" into give the desired answer, not the best answer. https://t.co/9wZr38B4eP-- Rob Zombie Graham?

(@ErrataRob) November 1, 2016On the same day Slate's piece appeared, the New York Times reporter it referenced published his own article about Trump's purported ties to Alfa Bank. The conclusion of that piece was more in line with Graham's take:In classified sessions in August and September, intelligence officials also briefed congressional leaders on the possibility of financial ties between Russians and people connected to Mr. Trump. They focused particular attention on what cyberexperts said appeared to be a mysterious computer back channel between the Trump Organization and the Alfa Bank, which is one of Russia's biggest banks and whose owners have longstanding ties to Mr. Putin.F.B.I. officials spent weeks examining computer data showing an odd stream of activity to a Trump Organization server and Alfa Bank. Computer logs obtained by The New York Times show that two servers at Alfa Bank sent more than 2,700 ""look-up"" messages -- a first step for one system's computers to talk to another -- to a Trump-connected server beginning in the spring. But the F.B.I. ultimately concluded that there could be an innocuous explanation, like a marketing email or spam, for the computer contacts.:Alfa Bank also sent us a statement of their own, holding that no connection existed between that financial institution and Donald Trump:Alfa Bank wishes to make clear that there is no connection between Alfa Bank and Donald Trump, the Trump campaign or the Trump organization. Any suggestion to the contrary is false. Alfa Bank hired Mandiant, one of the world's foremost U.S. cyber security experts, to investigate allegations of a connection by the media and it has found nothing to support them. Mandiant found no substantive contact, email or financial link between Alfa Bank and the Trump Campaign or Organization. Mandiant conducted a deep dive and investigated Alfa Bank's IT systems both remotely and on the ground in Moscow and there was no evidence of notable contact. Neither Alfa Bank nor its principals, including Mikhail Fridman and Petr Aven, have or have had any contact with Mr. Trump or his organizations. Fridman and Aven have never met Mr. Trump nor have they or Alfa Bank had any business dealings with him. Neither Alfa Bank nor its officers have sent Mr. Trump or his organisation any emails, information or money. Alfa Bank does not have and has never had any special or exclusive internet connection with Mr. Trump or his entities. The assertion of a special or private link is patently false. :Mandiant's working hypothesis, echoing what the New York Times said was the FBI's conclusion, is that the alleged activity noticed by reporters was caused by an email marketing/spam campaign by a marketing server, which triggered security software.  Commenting further on the allegations, Mandiant said: Mandiant, a FireEye company, has been retained by Alfa Bank to investigate information given to them by various media. The information that has been presented is a list of dates, times, IP Addresses and Domain Names. The list appears to be a scanned copy of a printed log. There is no information which indicates where the list has come from. The list contains approx. 2800 look ups of a Domain Name over a period of 90 days. The information presented is inconclusive and is not evidence of substantive contact or a direct email or financial link between Alfa Bank and the Trump Campaign or Organization. The list presented does not contain enough information to show that there has been any actual activity opposed to simple DNS look ups, which can come from a variety of sources including anti-spam and other security software.  As part of the ongoing investigation, Alfa Bank has opened its IT systems to Mandiant, which has investigated both remotely and on the ground in Moscow. We are continuing our investigation. Nothing we have or have found alters our view as described above that there isn't evidence of substantive contact or a direct email or financial link between Alfa Bank and the Trump Campaign or Organization.:Rumors about Donald Trump's purported ties to Russia have circulated roughly since the July 2016 DNC Leaks and subsequent allegations that information dumped via WikiLeaks was an attempt to attack Hillary Clinton for the mutual benefit of those entities. But the Slate article (presented as a question in its title) simply strung together circumstantial details to suggest Trump had a server connection to Russia. A concurrent and a subsequent look at its conclusions (the latter by a cybersecurity expert who was not anonymous) asserted that the claims were unsubstantiated and likely amounted to nothing.In March 2017, CNN reported that the issue was still under investigation by the FBI, but nothing substantive had yet been turned up:Federal investigators and computer scientists continue to examine whether there was a computer server connection between the Trump Organization and a Russian bank, sources close to the investigation tell CNN.Questions about the possible connection were widely dismissed four months ago. But the FBI's investigation remains open, the sources said, and is in the hands of the FBI's counterintelligence team -- the same one looking into Russia's suspected interference in the 2016 election.One U.S. official said investigators find the server relationship ""odd"" and are not ignoring it. But the official said there is still more work for the FBI to do. Investigators have not yet determined whether a connection would be significant.:"
216,216,46.DidPipeBombingSuspec,"Claim:Cesar Sayoc and Stormy Daniels worked at the same Florida strip club, suggesting or proving their parts in an anti-Trump conspiracy theory.Rating:Mostly FalseAbout this rating What's TrueStormy Daniels performed at the Ultra Lounge strip club in West Palm Peach, Florida, on two days in April 2018. Four and a half months later, Cesar Sayoc began working as a doorman and DJ at the same venue. What's FalseDaniels was never employed at the Ultra Lounge, the two days on which she performed there did not overlap with the two months of Sayoc's employment there, and the two of them did not otherwise know each other. :In October 2018, federal authorities arrested a 56-year-old Florida man named Cesar Sayoc in connection with the mailing of a series of explosive devices to high-profile figures within the Democratic party, as well as to liberal financier George Soros and others who have been critical of President Donald Trump.Before his arrest, Sayoc posted prolifically on social media, sharing right-wing conspiracy theories, attacking figures within the Democratic party or perceived liberals, and demonstrating his fervent support for President Trump by posting pro-Trump memes and photographs of himself in attendance at Trump rallies.This set of facts prompted a ""false flag"" conspiracy theory which held that the mail-bombing campaign was a hoax, and that the entire episode had been cynically orchestrated by Democrats or liberals with the aim of stoking outrage against President Trump and his supporters and providing a boost to Democratic candidates in the November 2018 elections.As putative proof, promoters of the conspiracy theory erroneously pointed to the uncancelled stamps which adorned some of the packages, the fact that postal workers do not directly deliver mail to Secret Service protectees such as former president Barack Obama and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, a false claim that Sayoc was once a registered Democrat, and a false claim that his encounter with an old college soccer teammate was in fact proof of a liberal conspiracy.:Against this background, yet another strand to the ""false flag"" conspiracy theory emerged in late October when local news media in Florida investigated Sayoc's personal and professional background, discovering that he had been working at the Ultra Lounge, a strip club in West Palm Beach, prior to his arrest.That establishment had once hosted an event featuring Stormy Daniels, the porn actor and stripper who has claimed that Donald Trump had a sexual encounter with her in 2006 and then arranged the payment of ""hush money"" to her during the 2016 presidential election campaign. Television station WPTV reported of Sayoc's employment at the Ultra Lounge that:Mail bombing suspect Cesar Sayoc worked as a DJ at Ultra Gentleman's Club in West Palm Beach, the same strip club where Trump accuser Stormy Daniels performed in April. WPTV spoke to Ultra manager Stacey Saccal who confirmed that Sayoc worked as a DJ Thursday afternoon, the day before he was arrested in Plantation. She said Sayoc had worked there for two months as a DJ and doorman. Saccal said there had been no complaints about Sayoc from other employees prior to his arrest Friday.:This coincidence, that Sayoc worked at the same Florida strip club where Stormy Daniels had performed in April, then formed the basis of widespread speculation and innuendo which held that the two must have known each other, and therefore this relationship proved or suggested a two-pronged liberal conspiracy to damage the presidency and authority of Donald Trump: First by accusing him of an extramarital sexual relationship, and then by associating him with a campaign of terrorism by one of his supporters.On 29 October, the conservative web site Townhall reported on the ""Ultra Lounge"" link, asking: ""Is all of this mere coincidence or a coordinated attack against President Trump?""Townhall subsequently deleted that line from their article and apologized, writing: ""A previous version of this post included a sentence that hinted at a baseless conspiracy, falling short of our standards. It has been deleted. We apologize for the error.""The right-wing blogger Kevin Whiteman published a post which expressed heavy skepticism that the link between Sayoc and Daniels (who was born Stephanie Clifford) was anything other than evidence of a conspiracy::What's even more far-fetched is the odds against, and I mean astronomical odds, that Sayoc and Daniels know each other. Now I realize that the world of pole-dancers and strip club DJs must be awfully select (sarcasm, off), but this is all just too much to give even the slightest whiff of credibility.On a personal note, for over two decades I've lived in the same neighborhood, but I simply cannot recall one instance of ever randomly bumping into either next-door-neighbor away from our homes.But I'm suppose to just buy-off that these two just happen to have crossed paths not all that long ago? If so, I have a bridge in Brooklyn I'd like to sell you.Same place, different timesThe theory that Sayoc and Daniels must have known each other and therefore that they were part of a liberal conspiracy to damage President Trump is based on a coincidence that is easily explained by something other than a secret plot and is also contradicted by the available evidence.:First, no evidence documents that Sayoc and Daniels knew each other, while some evidence to the contrary exists. Stacy Saccal, general manager of the Ultra Lounge, told WPTV that Sayoc had worked as a DJ and doorman at the strip club in the two months prior to his arrest in late October. This means he began working there at around the end of August 2018.On the other hand, Stormy Daniels was never employed at the Ultra Lounge but had worked there as a guest performer. According to the venue's social media accounts, Daniels performed just four shows at the Ultra Lounge, across only two days, 13 and 14 April 2018 -- four and a half months before Sayoc began working there.So Sayoc's two months of employment at the Ultra Lounge did not overlap with the two days upon which Daniels performed there.Beyond the fact that Daniels performed at the Ultra Lounge four months before Sayoc began working there, none of those claiming or speculating about a conspiracy involving Sayoc and Daniels have presented any other evidence that they knew each other, nor we were able to find any such evidence.:In order to claim, based on the available evidence, that Daniels and Sayoc knew each other well enough to be engaged in what would be a high-risk and likely illegal conspiracy to bring down a sitting U.S. president, one must also claim that everyone who provides a one-off service as a contractor to a particular business is equally closely connected to everyone who begins working at that business some months later.Same industryEven if evidence did exist that Sayoc and Daniels knew each other, there would be a perfectly sensible (blindingly obvious, even) explanation for such a connection: their professional interests overlapped.Daniels has been a porn actor and stripper for almost two decades and performed at the Ultra Lounge in April 2018 as part of a tour of strip clubs across the United States. Sayoc, for his part, has worked as a manager for male strippers, performed as a male stripper himself, and was working as a DJ and doorman at a strip club up to the time of his arrest in October 2018.:The statistical likelihood of any randomly chosen stripper who lives in Texas meeting a randomly chosen strip club doorman and former male stripper in Florida might be relatively low, but it would not not require an elaborate, shadowy political conspiracy for those two individuals to bump into each other.What the ""Sayoc-Daniels"" conspiracy theory misses, in this respect, is that statistical improbability is not at all the same thing as implausibility. When one considers how many clubs Stormy Daniels performs at in a given year, one might even say her working the same club as Sayoc (at different times) was more probable than implausible:Updated appearance schedule pic.twitter.com/358fyNLsSm-- Stormy Daniels (@StormyDaniels) February 2, 2018"

YouTube videos espousing the conspiracy theory splice together misinformation about HAARP with an interview Kaku did with CBS News in 2013 in which he talked about the possibility of governments one day being able to cause rainfall using lasers and other means. The description of the official video of the CBS interview read:Scientists and researchers may one day be able to manipulate rain and lightning using lasers. ""CBS This Morning"" contributor Michio Kaku, a physics professor at City College of New York, talks to Charlie Rose and Norah O'Donnell about the potential future of weather. :In the video, Kaku also discusses the possibility that governments had manipulated weather in the past to cause or prevent rainstorms, and he calls the evidence ""inconclusive"" several times. He said of current efforts to manipulate the weather that there was ""nothing conclusive ... [but scientists are] bringing in the laws of physics"" and ""actually using trillion watt lasers"" in such experiments. Kaku mentioned hurricanes at the end of a list of future theoretical weather modification applications:... in the laboratory, sure enough they [now] precipitate rain out of water vapor ... [but] the bad news is if it's a clear blue sky, it's not gonna do anything at all ... outdoor events, and agriculture, and flooding, and even hurricanes all can be subject to weather modification.We reached out to Kaku, who told us ""The story is 100% false.""Kaku also appeared on CBS in August 2017 to discuss Hurricane Harvey and the science behind hurricanes. He did not at any point say that HAARP had caused hurricanes.  : "
218,218,512.DidMuslimFederalJudg,"Claim:A Muslim federal judge has implemented ""two items"" of sharia law in the United States.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 24 July 2017, fake news site AsAmericanAsApplePie.org published a story reporting that a Muslim federal judge named ""Mahal al Alallaha-Smith"" had imposed ""two items"" of sharia law (which are religious codes governing conduct within Muslim communities) in the United States.:The article seems crafted to exploit a conspiracy theory among those who fear practitioners of Islam that sharia law is ""creeping"" into U.S. court systems, and that it will soon be forced upon American citizens as the new law of the land. However, the article is made up entirely of falsehoods -- including a digitally manipulated image of an actual Los Angeles Superior Court judge with a fake name superimposed over his actual name and, of course, a fabricated quote attributed to him:Judge Mahal al Alallaha-Smith of the 22nd District Federal Court of Appeals ruled this morning that two ""critical issues for Muslims"" in Sharia Law had to be abided by in the United States court system because of the systematic infusion clause and because the 14th Amendment guarantees them the rights guaranteed by other states. ...The items Judge Alallaha-Smith refers to are:-A man who finds his Godly wife in the arms of another may beat her in a non-life-threatening manner as prescribed by the Koran. The punishment of death for laying with another man in her own bed cannot be enforced on American soil, but the woman can be beaten daily for a period of ten years.-A family in need of expansion shall allow the marriage of first cousins for one generation as prescribed by the Koran. Women in those families can marry as young as 9 but won't be allowed to consummate until they hit maturity as prescribed in the Koran.Until this is fast-tracked to the Supreme Court, which can sometimes take years, Muslim women in America will be at risk.:After a quick inspection of the web site's own ""About"" page, the fictional content should be no surprise. It reveals that AsAmericanAsApplePie.org is not a reliable source of information -- in fact, if one scrolls down far enough it is finally apparent that the page labels itself as satire:When no one can trust the lying fake news liberal media anymore because they hate us and guns and Harley Davidson and meat and OUR president, As American as Apple Pie is here to be your beacon of something you can kinda rely on sometimes but not really.The image the site uses to represent Judge Mahal al Alallaha-Smith is stolen from a CNN report about a real person -- Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Halim Dhanidina. Court spokeswoman Mary Hearn pointed out that Dhanidina is not a federal judge, but rather a sitting judge for the Los Angeles Superior Court, which is ""a trial court for the state of California... California trial courts hear state matters, not federal.""Further, the nomenclature used by AsAmericanAsApplePie.org for the Court of Appeals is incorrect, as no ""22nd District Court of Appeals"" exists. The appellate courts are organized into twelve regional circuits and one federal circuit. There is also no ""systematic infusion clause"", whatever that means, to any amendment in the U.S. Constitution. (The 14th Amendment mostly deals with issues relating to citizenship, not religious beliefs.):Finally, laws dictating the legality of marriages between cousins are determined at the state level. We could find no evidence to support the idea that a new legal statute has been implemented in which criminally assaulting a woman would be legally permissible because of her husband's supposed religious beliefs.The article is made up of a series of fabricated claims by a satire site and is not based on any fact whatsoever -- the image, name and quotes from the alleged ""Muslim judge"" were all falsely presented, and his alleged occupation on the ""22nd District Court of Appeals"" is made up. In fact Dhanidina, the real judge featured by CNN in 2016, specifically said his religious beliefs have no bearing on how he performs his role in the justice system.The writer of the fake article, in keeping with the theme of this satire site, uses the name ""Flagg Eagleton"". Other fake news items authored by Flagg include an article reporting that North Korea's autocratic leader Kim Jong Un was killed in a bomb drop ordered by President Donald Trump and another reporting that a crowd cheered outside a hospital as Trump's 2016 rival Hillary Clinton ""takes her last breath."":The lack of facts has not stopped numerous people from credulously sharing the article and their own anti-Muslim sentiments along with it. One Fox News viewer took to Judge Jeanine Pirro's fan page and wrote with alarm:AMERICAN'S MUST OBJECT TO MUSLIM'S BEING ALLOWED INTO THE GOVERMENT IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM !WAKE UP AMERICA !!! HURRYJudge Mahal al Alallaha-Smith of the 22nd District Federal Court of Appeals ruled this morning that two ""critical issues for Muslims"" in Sharia Law had to be abided by in the United States court system because of the systematic infusion clauseCommenters on the hoax site's own Facebook page also seemed unaware of its status as a ""satire and entertainment"" site, with vitriolic responses calling for the (nonexistent) judge's removal from his (fictional) position, and saying -- predictably -- that Muslim people should not be allowed to serve as judges in the United States.AsAmericanAsApplePie.org gave their readers what they wanted a few days later, when they published an equally false report stating that President Trump had removed Judge Mahal al Alallaha-Smith from his position.:"
219,219,215.DidJamesClapperOutBa,"Claim:Former U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper ""outed"" President Barack Obama as the ""mastermind"" behind the ""Russia hoax.""Rating:FalseAbout this rating A video circulated on social media in October 2019 bore a misleading caption: ""James Clapper Outs Barack Obama as Mastermind Behind Russia Hoax.""The caption accompanied a video of former U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper in an interview with CNN, discussing the Trump administration's decision to investigate the origins of inquiries into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The video appeared to have been uploaded to a video-sharing blog platform.:Clapper did not say what the video caption claimed: He did not ""out"" Obama as the ""mastermind"" behind the ""Russia hoax."" Clapper instead aired his dismay at the turn of events in which Obama's successor, Donald Trump, had essentially compelled the government to launch an investigation into its own findings that the Kremlin had manipulated the 2016 presidential election.The original CNN video can be viewed by following this link. Here is a transcript of the exchange between Clapper and CNN host Jim Sciutto:SCIUTTO: As you know, the president now has sitting members of this government. You have the attorney general traveling the world now, meeting with U.S. intelligence partners, trying to find out, in his view, whether they participated in some sort of Obama administration-led effort to undermine President Trump in the last election here. You also know that John Durham, who is a former prosecutor, senior Justice Department official, he's pursuing his own investigation on the origins of that probe. Are you concerned that Barr's or Durham's investigation will find wrongdoing and seek to punish former intelligence officials?CLAPPER: Well, I don't know, I don't think there was any wrongdoing. I think at the time all of us were trying to navigate a very, very difficult, politically fraught, highly-charged situation. I know for my part, my main concern was, were the Russians, and the threat posed by the Russians to our very political fabric. And the message I'm getting from all this is, apparently what we were supposed to have done was to ignore the Russian interference, ignore the Russian meddling and the threat that it poses to us, and oh by the way, blowing off what the then-commander-in-chief, President Obama, told us to do, which was to assemble all the reporting that we could, that we had available to us and put it in one report that the president could pass on to the Congress and to the next administration. And, while we're at it, declassify as much as we possibly could to make it public. And that's what we did. And it's kind of disconcerting now to be investigated for having done our duty and done what we were told to do by the president.:Multiple investigations have concluded that Russians interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and that their activities were aimed at helping Donald Trump to get elected. Even though Trump repeatedly called those investigations ""witch hunts,"" he appeared to admit in May 2019 to at least knowing that Russians had interfered in the election:Russia, Russia, Russia! That's all you heard at the beginning of this Witch Hunt Hoax...And now Russia has disappeared because I had nothing to do with Russia helping me to get elected. It was a crime that didn't exist. So now the Dems and their partner, the Fake News Media,.....-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2019Trump and his supporters, however, have undertaken an aggressive campaign to discredit investigations that have concluded the Russians interfered in the 2016 election with the aim of helping Trump win, to the extent that Trump has leveraged his own administration to investigate the inquiry that led to that finding.:In October 2019 President Trump was facing an impeachment inquiry over a phone call he had with the Ukrainian president, with Trump being accused of holding back key military aid in exchange for Ukraine's assistance in obtaining damaging information about a Trump political rival. But in that call, Trump also asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into a debunked conspiracy theory positing that the hacked Democratic National Committee server from 2016 was in Ukraine -- a conspiracy theory that exculpates the Russians in the hacking operation.In other words, the Obama administration conducted an investigation based on evidence which led to the conclusion that Russians had manipulated the 2016 presidential election. To say Obama was the ""mastermind"" of a ""hoax"" amounts to political propaganda favoring Trump while distorting reality."

Although it's true that 15-year-old Imani Towana Doswell (her first name was initially misspelled as ""Emani"") went missing in January 2018, a spokesperson for the Baltimore Police Department told Snopes in an email that the girl's mother reported in February 2018 she had returned home safe.Here is an image of the post on Reddit::We were unable to locate an item on Wayfair's website called a ""Doswell Door Wardrobe."" We sent an email to Wayfair asking if it's a real product, and will update this story when we receive a response.Nevertheless, the item in the meme doesn't match the name of a missing child, nor is there any evidence that Wayfair is or has been involved in child trafficking."
221,221,75.AntoninScaliasDeathP,"On 13 February 2016, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died on a Texas hunting trip.Although Scalia was 79 years old at the time of his death, he was also considered to be in reasonably good health and had no stated intention of retiring. The event was unexpected, and as with most unexpected deaths, there was initially some confusion over the accuracy of the news.  Because of that and his family's decision not to order an autopsy (and because his death occurred in an election year) speculation and rumormongering immediately ensued.Immediately, social media users speculated as to whether the timing of his death was suspect enough to warrant additional attention. On 14 February 2016, a Facebook user published the following status update, encapsulating one of many intricate theories:The man you see shaking hands with Barack Obama is the owner of the Texas ranch resort Justice Scalia was found dead at. His name is John Poindexter and he was earlier honored during a ceremony by Obama.:Mr. Poindexter was the one who helped get Justice Scalia declared dead w/o an actual medical examination. (It was apparently done over the phone based upon his descriptions of the Justice's condition) He was also the one who was the link between Justice Scalia's death and the response of federal authorities.No autopsy was ordered...:Much of the post's text appeared to be based on details published in a 14 February 2016 New York Times article specifically about the discovery of Scalia's body:When Justice Antonin Scalia did not respond to a knock at the door of his suite at the Cibolo Creek Ranch at 8:30 a.m. on Saturday, John B. Poindexter, the property's owner, was not alarmed ... It was less than three hours later, when Mr. Poindexter tried again, that he found Justice Scalia's body.Justice Scalia had no pulse and was clearly dead, Mr. Poindexter recalled in an interview on Sunday.The Facebook post asserted Scalia was ""apparently"" declared dead via telephone, a circumstance described across several paragraphs in the Times' article. But that also appeared to be anecdotal, based on an e-mails from Texas judge David Beebe:Just after 11 a.m., Mr. Poindexter and a friend of Justice Scalia's tried the door again, again to no answer. They entered the room, and it took no medical training, Mr. Poindexter said, to recognize that Justice Scalia was dead.Mr. Poindexter called a hospital and, without identifying Justice Scalia, reported what had happened. A hospital official, Mr. Poindexter said, assessed that it would be impossible to resuscitate Justice Scalia, and ranch officials contacted the United States Marshals Service.That call set into motion hours of intense discussions about how to navigate the protocols associated with the death of a Supreme Court justice outside the Washington area.""No identity or clue was given that this was not another body found by hunters in the desert,"" David Beebe, a justice of the peace, wrote in an email Saturday night.Judge Beebe said County Judge Cinderela Guevera had ultimately pronounced Justice Scalia dead by telephone and ""ruled it natural causes based on credible information."" She did not respond to messages on Sunday.:The Times didn't clarify whether Beebe was present, party to the flurry of activity in or around Cibolo Creek Ranch on 13 February 2016, or how he came to learn details of the chain of declaration of death.Beebe's relevance was further detailed in a 14 February 2016 NPR piece:When Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died Saturday in Presidio County, it wasn't easy to arrange the inquest, the judicial inquiry into the death ... I was reporting from a candidate forum in neighboring Brewster County. Officials from all three counties were in attendance. David Beebe, the justice of the peace for Precinct 1 in Presidio County, was there, too. Shortly after 1 p.m., he received a request to handle an inquest for ""a dead body"" back in his county.Beebe responded he was also far away, too, busy at the political forum. The deceased wasn't identified. Bishop said she would find an alternate. In this border county, sometimes the dead body is an undocumented migrant. Identification can take weeks; death can wait.Bishop contacted the third choice, Presidio County Judge Cinderella Guevara, who was also unable to make the drive to Cibolo Creek Ranch. Connecting with the county sheriff there, she officially handled the inquest -- over the phone -- pronouncing Justice Scalia dead just before 2 p.m. The Texas Code of Criminal Procedures allows justices of the peace to pronounce death via phone when deemed reasonable.:It wasn't until after 3 p.m. that the news started to make its way to the local officials at the candidates forum. Phones lit up. People stopped paying attention to the debate on the stage. I was sitting near Judge Beebe, and we rushed out of the school auditorium together. We drove straight to the only funeral home in the area, in Alpine -- where there was no answer at the door.As the additional information from an on-the-scene press account indicated, Beebe was initially contacted, but not advised that the death in question involved Scalia. When Beebe and the reporter learned that the deceased was in fact a Supreme Court Justice, both hastily traveled a long distance to the funeral home closest to Cibolo Creek Ranch. In the interim, Judge Cinderella Guevara declared Scalia dead per the jurisdiction's protocol (by phone).Poindexter provided further details about the chain of events surrounding Scalia's death in a 15 February 2016 San Antonio Express-News article:""We discovered the judge in bed, a pillow over his head. His bed clothes were unwrinkled ... He was lying very restfully. It looked like he had not quite awakened from a nap,"" he said.Scalia, 79, did not have a pulse and his body was cold, and after consulting with a doctor at a hospital in Alpine, Poindexter concluded resuscitation would have been futile, He then contacted federal authorities, at first encountering a series of answering services because he was calling on a weekend.""Ultimately they became available and handled it superbly. They flew in by helicopter. They told me to secure the ranch, which I did until this morning,"" he said.:That article concluded by reporting that the ""body of the Supreme Court justice was moved to an El Paso funeral home early Sunday,"" per the wishes of Scalia's family. The Facebook post asserted that ""no autopsy was ordered"" shortly after stating Scalia was pronounced dead via phone, creating the impression that the two details were somehow linked and some barrier existed to an official forensic investigation.However, a 14 February 2016 Chicago Tribune article reported that Scalia's family declined an autopsy and simply requested his body be returned to Washington as soon as possible:Chris Lujan, a manager for Sunset Funeral Homes ... says an autopsy was not performed.He says Scalia's family didn't think a private autopsy was necessary and requested his remains be flown home as soon as possible.The county official who declared Scalia dead Saturday did not order an autopsy after finding he had died of natural causes. She said investigators told her there were no signs of foul play.:That article included a 15 February 2016 statement from the U.S. Marshals Service about Scalia's death, confirming Scalia declined security detail for the trip:The U.S. Marshals Service routinely coordinates with the U.S. Supreme Court police to provide security for the Justices, however, Justices may decline USMS protection. In this instance, the USMS detail was declined for the personal trip to the hunting resort in Texas, so USMS personnel were not present at the ranch. Deputy U.S. Marshals from the Western District of Texas responded immediately upon notification of Justice Scalia's passing.The Washington Post confirmed Scalia's family opposed an autopsy:As official Washington tried to process what his demise means for politics and the law, some details of Scalia's final hours remained opaque. As late as Sunday afternoon, for example, there were conflicting reports about whether an autopsy should have been performed. A manager at the El Paso funeral home where Scalia's body was taken said that his family made it clear they did not want one.:Speculation over the lack of autopsy wasn't confined to social media. As the Dallas Observer reported on 15 February 2016, conspiracy magnate Alex Jones leapt into the fray almost immediately:Radio talk show host Alex Jones, never one to pass up an opportunity to stir the pot, said he feels this happened ""in his gut."" ...Scalia was not a young man. He was 79 years old and friends at the West Texas ranch where he died say he went to bed early because he didn't feel well. There are many natural causes of death that could be responsible. A heart attack seems to be the most probable cause, and local media are reporting that his death certificate will read ""myocardial infarction."" Other media reports say the cause will be deemed natural. Either way, no official is suggesting homicide.Let's not let that stop us from conjecture. Besides, there are also a few man-made ways to kill him that would fit the very thin facts -- some of which would be hard to prove even if examiners conducted an autopsy.The Facebook post linked above is an excellent example of such conjecture. It depicted Cibolo Creek Ranch owner John Poindexter with President Obama implying some kind of connection. However, that photo was taken on or around 20 October 2009, when Poindexter was invited by President Obama to the White House for a 2009 ceremony in which he was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for heroism for his service in Vietnam::The Presidential Unit Citation, the highest honor given to a military unit, has been issued since World War II and is awarded to U.S. Armed Forces units that display extraordinary heroism in combat against an armed enemy force. It has been bestowed roughly 100 times, Obama said. The initially confusing circumstances of Antonin Scalia's death were not at all suspicious. Poindexter was circumspect in securing the scene out of respect for Scalia, and reaching an official from a remote area in Texas on a Saturday was complicated. In compliance with local protocol, Scalia's death was declared by the first available judge via phone, and after Scalia was transported to a funeral home his family declined an autopsy. Cibolo Creek Ranch owner John Poindexter was indeed photographed with President Obama, but that occurred during a 2009 ceremony for veterans.We were unable to find any other connection between Poindexter and President Obama, nor anything that made us suspect that Justice Antonin Scalia's death was anything but the peaceful, ordinary death of a man who was nearly 80 years old.:"
222,222,87.LasVegasShooterDiedi,"Claim:Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock died in 2013.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 24 January 2013, a man named Stephen Gorham Paddock passed away at the age of 71 in Colorado Springs, Colorado. More than 4 years later, after a man of a similar name shot and killed more than 50 people in Las Vegas, the first man's obituary was dragged around the internet as proof of a nonsensical conspiracy theory::This 2013 obituary for Stephen Gorham Paddock is real. However, it has nothing to do with the mass shooting in Las Vegas. Although conspiracy theorists correctly noted that the individual who passed away in 2013 and the gunman who opened fire on a group of concertgoers in Las Vegas had similar names, they failed to explain how this was proof of a conspiracy or what exactly the conspiracy theory entailed. Were they the same person? Did the 2013 Paddock fake his death? Did the Las Vegas shooter steal his identity? Although basic logic prevented us from completely wrapping our head around this theory, the main claim appears to be that the Las Vegas shooting was a false flag event since the shooter has been dead since 2013::Unsurprisingly, there are a few holes in this theory. For one, the man who passed away in 2013 and the Las Vegas gunmen don't actually share the same name. The 2013 obituary was written for a man named Stephen Gorham Paddock, whereas police identified the gunman as Stephen Craig Paddock. The family information contained within this obituary also doesn't match what is known about the Las Vegas shooter. Gorham's brothers, for instance, were listed as Bob and Rick, but the shooter's brother's name is Eric.  :Those spreading this conspiracy theory seem to be under the impression that there can only be one ""Stephen Paddock"" on the planet at a time. Although we can't say with certainty just how popular this name is, we can safely say that multiple people have to deal with the unfortunate circumstance of sharing a name with a killer. A brief search on Facebook, for instance, revealed dozens of people with similar names::In fact, the viral obituary noted that the deceased's father was also named Stephen Paddock. The Las Vegas shooter's father, on the other hand, was named Benjamin."
223,223,483.FatherofBristolPalin,"Claim:   Video shows a young black man who fathered Bristol Palin's child.Status:   False.Example:   [Collected via e-mail, September 2008]I received this today. It is a video from a young man claiming to be the real father of Brigit Palin's baby.:Origins:   Almost as soon as John McCain announced Alaska governor Sarah Palin as his choice for a running mate in the 2008 presidential election, up popped a rumor that Palin's youngest child (Trig, born in April 2008) was not actually her own child, but the child of her unmarried teenage daughter, Bristol. According to an elaborate conspiracy theory, in order to avoid potential political embarrassment Governor Palin had faked experiencing the late stages of pregnancy and a childbirth (while Bristol was supposedly absent from school with a conveniently lengthy illness) so she could deceptively claim as her own an infant actually born to her daughter.  In a surprising twist, the rumor was put to rest a few days later by the revelation that 17-year-old Bristol was already five months pregnant and therefore could not possibly have given birth to a child less than five months earlier.  The father of Bristol Palin's child was revealed to be 18 year-old Levi Johnston, Bristol's boyfriend of about a year, and it was announced that the two teenagers planned to marry.  Those disclosures didn't stop others from trying to capitalize on Palin pregnancy rumors, however, with one of the most widespread variants being the video shown above, in which a young black man who identifies himself as a Los Angeles native named Kevin claims to be the real father of Bristol Palin's baby.  According to Kevin's five-minute long explanation, he met Bristol Palin when he was ""up in Wasilla [Alaska], visiting"" for a couple of months ""last summer"" while his uncle worked on a pipeline; during that period he and Bristol met, dated, became ""intimate,"" and conceived a child together, but now the Palin family ""don't want [him] to be around"" and are covering up the truth.  He put up his video ""to make a little bit of noise"" because he wants to be recognized as the real father, and he'll take it down just as soon as Bristol calls him.:Dozens of holes could be poked in the story laid out by ""Kevin"" in his video confession, but for simplicity's sake we'll list just a few of the most glaring inconsistencies: Kevin claims he was in Wasilla ""last summer"" (i.e., the summer of 2008).  Since Bristol Palin was five months pregnant at the beginning of September 2008, her child had to have been conceived by the beginning of April 2008 -- thus Kevin would have arrived in Wasilla far too late to have fathered her child, as she was already expecting by the time of his visit.  (Even if ""last summer"" refers to the summer of 2007 rather than 2008, the timeline still doesn't work: a child conceived back then would already have been born.) Kevin makes present tense reference to Bristol's attending Wasilla High School and states that the two of them hung out there together.  However, the principal at Wasilla High  stated that Bristol had stopped attending that school several months earlier, having transferred mid-year to a high school in Anchorage. (""Bristol Palin, the 17-year-old daughter of Alaska governor and presumptive GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, attended the school until last year.

We found that exact clip at the 3:12 mark in the YouTube video below titled, ""FIRST MAN | Behind the Frame IMAX Featurette."" The second shot in the Twitter video (it shows three men standing against a bright light, two of whom are wearing space suits) is the same as the scene at 3:44 in the YouTube video below.

The clip of an astronaut tripping and bouncing back up was taken from the 1989 documentary, ""For All Mankind,"" which used authentic NASA footage of astronauts on various space missions, ranging from Apollo 7 to Apollo 17.

The June 2023 tweet was not the first instance of someone claiming that Kubrick shot and directed footage of the 1969 moon landing, proving it was faked. In 2015, one particular rumor centered on an alleged interview with the famed director in which he supposedly said he helped NASA shoot a moon-landing video. The interview was fake (it did not actually show Kubrick) and originated with a film from T. Patrick Murray, titled ""Shooting Stanley Kubrick."" A spokesperson for Kubrick's widow confirmed that interview was falsified. ""Stanley Kubrick has never been interviewed by T. Patrick Murray the whole story is made up, fraudulent and untrue,"" the spokesperson said.:Given that a portion of the in-question footage was pulled from a fictionalized Hollywood film about the moon landing, the real clips of astronauts were unrelated to that movie and misrepresented, and Kubrick's family spoke against his alleged involvement in such a conspiracy theory in the past, we rated this claim ""False.""

225,225,491.DidBillClintonFireHi,"Claim:President Bill Clinton firing of FBI Director William Sessions was linked to Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster's death a day later. Rating:MixtureAbout this rating What's TruePresident Clinton fired FBI Director William Sessions on 19 July 1993, one day before Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster, a longtime associate of the Clintons, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.What's FalseThere is nothing inherently suspicious about the coincidental timing of Sessions's firing and Vince Foster's death (which was determined to be a suicide).:On 11 May 2017, two days into a firestorm ignited by President Trump's dismissal of FBI Director James Comey, who was investigating possible links between Trump's presidential campaign and Russian efforts to disrupt the 2016 election, supporters of the administration took to social media to deflect attention elsewhere.Cued, perhaps, by the innumerable talking heads on cable television pointing out that only once before in American history had an FBI director been fired in the middle of his term by the president -- namely, when Bill Clinton axed William Sessions on 19 July 1993 -- one of the go-to concepts was an implied link between Sessions's firing and the death of longtime Clinton crony and Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster the following day (20 July 1993).For example:Clinton cash $675K McCabe is Acting FBI Director.Oh, and Clinton fired his FBI head the day before Vince Foster was found dead. pic.twitter.com/gg2kuOwqLD-- ?AMERICA?FIRST? (@TrueNevvs) May 11, 2017:Here's another example that was retweeted nearly 4,000 times (including once by President Trump's son, Donald Trump, Jr., who evidently found it compelling):President Clinton fired his FBI director on July 19th, 1993, The Day before Vince Foster was found dead in Marcy Park.#ThursdayThoughts pic.twitter.com/wgbv9lAhDV-- ?STOCK MONSTER? (@StockMonsterUSA) May 11, 2017The Sessions/Foster linkage was also promoted in articles on right-leaning blogs and web sites such as 100PercentFedUp.com. Apart from an interminable recitation of an old, discredited conspiracy theory implicating the Clintons in Foster's death, however, the only argument these venues can come up with for there being a connection between the Sessions firing and Foster's death is this:President Bill Clinton fired FBI Director William S. Sessions on July 19, 1993.Vince Foster was found dead on July 20, 1993.Was the suspicious death of Vince Foster and the firing of Republican FBI Director William S. Sessions firing a coincidence? Did President Clinton need an FBI Director who was willing to look the other way when it came to the alleged criminal activities of the Clintons?:In lieu of an argument, there is only innuendo. In terms of actual evidence, none is offered. In point of fact, a review of the facts of each case leaves no reason to suspect, much less conclude, that they are connected.The Firing of William SessionsWilliam Sessions, who had experience as both a practicing attorney and U.S. District Judge, was nominated as FBI Director by President Ronald Reagan and sworn in on 2 November 1987. After serving under both Reagan and George H. W. Bush, Sessions was still in the post at the time of Bill Clinton's inauguration in 1993, but was beset by accusations of ethical improprieties. These were laid out in a report by the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility, as follows by the New York Times reported at the time: The report found that Mr. Sessions had taken numerous free trips aboard F.B.I. aircraft to visits friends and relatives, often taking along his wife, Alice. The report, which was endorsed officially by Attorney General William P. Barr on his last day in office, detailed a litany of abuses. It is a lacerating portrayal of the Director as an official who was in charge of enforcing the law but who seemed blase about perceptions of his own conduct.:At the behest of Attorney General Janet Reno, who advised the president that Director Sessions could no longer lead the agency effectively in the wake of the accusations, Clinton asked for his resignation, which Sessions, who denied any wrongdoing, refused to turn over. After a six-month stalemate during which morale at the FBI hit a ""new low,"" according to the New York Times, President Clinton summarily dismissed Sessions on 19 July 1993.Vincent Foster's SuicideVince Foster, who was a childhood friend of Bill Clinton's and helped Hillary Clinton secure a position at the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas, served on President-elect Clinton's transition team after the 1992 election and went on to be the Deputy White House Counsel. Despite having been a successful attorney, the Washington Post reported, Foster found the White House job extremely daunting and suffered from anxiety and depression. Special Counsel Robert B. Fiske, Jr., who later investigated the circumstances surrounding Foster's death, concluded he wasn't emotionally equipped to handle the stress::From the pinnacle of the Arkansas legal establishment, Foster leaped into the service of his boyhood friend, Bill Clinton, after Clinton was elected president. According to Fiske, the toll on Foster was intense from the beginning. During the transition period - when he vetted a number of top appointees - Foster complained to his Little Rock physician of depression and anxiety.His symptoms grew worse when he got to Washington. In January 1993, Zoe E. Baird was forced to withdraw her nomination as attorney general because she had failed to pay taxes for a nanny; fresh from his inauguration, President Clinton was hit with charges of elitism and corner-cutting and incompetent screening. Foster blamed himself - the Fiske report shows him constantly shouldering blame for mistakes made in the chaotic White House - and the night of the Baird debacle Foster was literally sick from a panic attack.The embarrassment was even greater when seven employees of the White House travel office were summarily fired amid hints of financial shenanigans, because it turned out the investigation had been slapdash, the firings hasty, and the odor of cronyism hung over the whole affair. The ""Travelgate"" fallout singed Foster and burned his friend and protege, William Kennedy, also of the counsel's office. Kennedy drew an official reprimand.:Distraught at the prospect of facing a Congressional hearing, Foster developed insomnia and went deeper and deeper into depression. On 19 July 1993, his doctor prescribed an anti-depressant, which Foster began taking. On 20 July, he left his office after lunch, drove to Fort Marcy Park in Virginia, and shot himself once in the mouth.Despite conspiracy theories that swirled at the time (and continue, obviously, to make the rounds to this day), five separate investigations over time have concluded that Foster's death was a suicide.Conclusion Each of the two cases under discussion has its own timeline of events, neither of which intersects in any significant way with the other. Although an effort has been made to link them via innuendo, no plausible reason has been put forward by anyone to think their occurrence one day apart in 1993 is anything other than a coincidence.:"
226,226,126.IsThisanOuttakefromt,"Claim:A video clip shows a NASA studio-produced 'outtake' of the first manned moon landing.Rating:FalseAbout this rating The fanciful notion that the six Apollo lunar missions launched by the USA between 1969 and 1972 which landed a total of twelve men who walked on the moon were elaborate hoaxes staged in top secret desert locations and movie studios here on Earth has been a familiar aspect of popular culture and conspiracy theory since the first moon landing in 1969::Perhaps because Americans' confidence in their government was at a low ebb due to the nation's controversial military involvement in Vietnam, perhaps because people felt threatened by the rapid onrush of technological progress the space program represented, or perhaps just because some people enjoy the furtive thrill of disseminating the ""secret knowledge"" encapsulated conspiracy theories, the moon landings have become a locus for cynical disbelief in America's tremendous achievements in space exploration. (This cynicism was turned into popular entertainment in the 1978 film Capricorn One.):A less elaborate video twist on the moon landing hoax was featured at moontruth.com, where web surfers could view a re-creation (or perhaps we should say ""pre-creation"") of the first moon landing, purportedly filmed in 1965; the footage is revealed to be studio fakery when a bank of arc lights breaks loose, intruding into the shot sending the film crew swarming onto the set to prepare for another ""take.""Many people inquired of us whether the (fictional) backstory given on moontruth.com about the video clip was real. (Presumably they didn't all believe the moon landings were faked and instead were questioning whether some ""rehearsals"" might have been filmed by NASA for whatever reasons, as implied in the site's disclaimer ""There is no proof that because this was shot in a studio, the moon landing was necessarily faked."") For them we note that at least two humorous aspects of the clip (inserted intentionally or otherwise) give it away as a post-Apollo fabrication:1) The ""astronaut"" in the clip flubs the ""One small step ..."" line (by omitting the word ""a"" between the words ""for"" and ""man"") just as Neil Armstrong did during the real Apollo 11 moon landing in July 1969.:2) In the closing moments of the clip, the ""astronaut"" can be heard apologizing to ""Mr. Gorsky,"" a reference to a Neil Armstrong-related joke-cum-urban legend from the mid-1990s.If that isn't sufficient, the moontruth.com site eventually published a disclaimer noting that:Yes, the clip is fake. It was shot in a studio in London in spring 2002. It was based on an idea by director Adam Stewart, who was a space exploration nut. He had read the conspiracy theory sites and decided he wanted to make a spoof based on the idea that the Apollo 11 moon landing was faked."

These posts made a number of unsupported claims about Salvador Ramos, the 18-year-old gunman in the deadly school shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas. Unverified rumors thrived in the aftermath of the tragic killing, as we previously reported. Nineteen children and two teachers died in the mass shooting, which took place on May 24, 2022.The text in the viral Facebook messages was copied and pasted, a type of post we refer to as copypasta.

However, CNN and The New York Times both reported that he had worked for a different fast food restaurant chain: Wendy's.'Dressed in Expensive Women's Clothes'The line in the ""more oddities re: TX school shooter"" Facebook post that said Ramos ""dressed in expensive women's clothes"" appeared to refer to a debunked conspiracy theory that he had identified as transgender. (A variation of the Facebook post also falsely used the words ""transvestite ILLEGAL"" to describe Ramos.):School Dropout and Video GamesAccording to The Washington Post, it's true that Ramos dropped out of school. We also found reporting from The New York Times that said he played video games, including Call of Duty and Fortnite. However, we have yet to locate any details that confirmed Ramos dropped out because he was ""obsessed"" with video games. We also have yet to find information that verified the rumor about Ramos supposedly owning ""a brand new expensive game console.""A 'Brand New' Ford F-250 Super Duty PlatinumThe Facebook post mentioned purported details about the truck Ramos crashed near the school on the day of the shooting. CNN.com published a close-up picture of the truck that was photographed by Pete Luna with The Uvalde Leader-News.The post claimed the truck was a ""brand new"" Ford F-250 Super Duty Platinum that Ramos had bought and owned himself. However, ABC News reported that the truck found at the scene was a 2008 Ford F-150. The Daily Beast also published that the truck was owned by Ramos' grandmother, who he shot prior to driving the vehicle near the school.:Rifles and AmmunitionThe next part of the post said that Ramos had purchased and taken into the school ""two brand new Daniel Defense (brand) AR15/M4 rifles with military grade optics."" It also claimed: ""Each rifle is between 3,000 and 4,000 dollars. Thousands of rounds of expensive military grade ammunition. A thousand dollar bullet proof vest.""The Houston Chronicle reported that one of the weapons Ramos took into Robb Elementary was ""a Daniel Defense DDM4 V7 rifle, which retails for $1,870."" ABC News published that the rifle was ""modeled after the M4 carbine, the U.S. military's go-to rifle."" ABC News also reported that, ""according to pictures of the shooter's guns posted on Instagram, he appears to have purchased a battery-powered holographic sight that typically sells for around $725.""The Chronicle reported that the other gun brought into the school by Ramos was ""a Smith & Wesson MP 15, which retails for about $1,300."" The article from the Chronicle said that Ramos purchased ""hundreds of rounds of ammunition,"" not ""thousands"" as the Facebook post claimed. (We have not yet been able to find any information about the cost of the tactical vest that was confirmed as having been worn by Ramos at the school.):False Flag, Las Vegas, and BuffaloThe rest of the ""more oddities re: TX school shooter"" Facebook post delved into falsely labeling the school shooting as a false flag. The post claimed, without evidence, that ""someone was funding"" Ramos and was involved in ""training him"" as well, all to provide leverage to ""end"" the Second Amendment.The post also said that the ""exact"" same kind of guns Ramos used were found in the possession of Stephen Paddock in Las Vegas. In 2017, Paddock killed and injured scores of concertgoers from a high-floor window of a Vegas hotel room. ABC15.com reported that 24 guns were found in the hotel room. It's true that the list showed that Paddock used a Daniel Defense DDM4V11, similar to Ramos' DDM4V7. However, this wasn't ""exactly"" the same gun, as charged by the Facebook post. We also found no evidence that Paddock carried a Smith & Wesson M&P15 like Ramos had with him at Robb Elementary.Lastly, the post charged, again without evidence, that Ramos knew Payton S. Gendron, the alleged shooter in deadly mass shooting at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, which occurred on May 14, 2022. We found no evidence that Ramos knew Gendron.:In sum, the ""more oddities re: TX school shooter"" Facebook post contained quite a lot of falsehoods and unsupported rumors. For this reason, we have chosen an overall rating of ""Mostly false.""Note: In addition to the aforementioned victims of the Uvalde school shooting, Joe Garcia, the husband of slain teacher Irma Garcia, also suffered a fatal heart attack two days after the incident.

228,228,500.AmeroCoins,"Claim:   The U.S. has been producing the ""Amero"" coins, money to be used by an economic union of the USA, Canada, and Mexico.FALSEExample:   [Collected via e-mail, September 2007]""THE AMERO"" IS REAL;I HAVE ONE TO PROVE IT!UNITED STATES, CANADA AND MEXICO TO BE MERGED INTO SINGLE NEW ENTITYNAMED NORTH AMERICAN UNION!By: Hal TurnerThree weeks ago, I published a brief snippet on the front page of my web site reporting the governments of the US Canada and Mexico are conspiring in secret to merge the three nations into a new entity called the North American Union.There has been much talk of this on various internet blogs for over a year. Most of those blogs have been smeared as ""conspiracy theorists"" and have been largely ignored by the main stream.What prompted my interest in the issue was money: I was sent professional images of actual AMERO coins by someone in the US Treasury! The person included a note saying they like my radio show and are frightened by what's been going on in secret within our government.This Treasury Department person was outraged that our country was beginning to coin money as part of a merger that would do away with our country, via a merger the American public knew nothing about!(Rest of article here).:   Origins:   To make sense of this wild tale about ""Amero"" coins being secretly minted by the U.S. government for use by an economic union of the USA, Canada, and Mexico, we will first delve into what the Euro is and why some folks are far from enamored of it. Bear with us while we take that short side trip. (Or, if you must, skip the next three paragraphs to transition directly to the U.S. portion of the story.):The Euro is the official currency of the European Union, a supranational union comprising 27 member states, and is the sole currency for more than 317 million people. (Not every EU member country has chosen to adopt the Euro; some continue to use their traditional currencies.) The move to a single currency in Europe comes with both advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, it does away with the cost of exchanging money, thereby leaving more cash in the pockets of both individual consumers and businesses. It also puts an end to the trouble of having to change one's currency into that of the country being traveled to or traded with, then having to change it back again afterwards -- one simply uses the same wad of bills. And it ends fluctuations in the value of one country's money in relation to that of another: when only one currency is used, a cross-border deal struck for a specified amount of cash does not suddenly go up or down in price as the financial markets move, thereby ruining one party to the deal while dropping a windfall into the undeserving lap of the other.On the downside, one central currency means one central bank, which means one central monetary policy. That means individual countries which have subscribed to such a plan cannot combat their individual homelands' economic problems by adjusting their countries' money supplies, either to stimulate growth in moribund national economies or to put the brakes on those that appear to be racing out of control -- those countries must instead abide by what the group is doing, even when it runs counter to their individual best interests.:That covers what's going on in Europe, and why some love the Euro while others view it as a dangerous idea set loose upon an unsuspecting public. At various times it has been suggested that North America should follow a like route by adopting an omnibus currency similar to the Euro, one that would serve as the common money for the USA, Canada, and Mexico. While that notion does have a few proponents, it is a long way from being taken seriously, let alone being regarded as a good idea. Which brings us to the question of the ""Amero,"" the name bestowed upon the hypothetical currency such a union would use as its common specie. In 1999, a professor of economics at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver published The Case for the Amero, a study that advanced the idea that the three North American countries would be better served by their having a common currency. And there the matter rests, or at least it did before Designs Computed thought to add to its catalogue of commemorative coins, medals, and tokens a suite of Ameros, a series of collectible coins struck from its concept of what coinage for such a currency might look like. Designs Computed is very clear on its web site that its Ameros are in fact ""private-issue fantasy pattern coins [that] will be struck as an annual series,"" and indeed is already offering some of them for sale. Neither the U.S. Mint nor the U.S. Treasury had a hand in creating these ""Ameros.""  These coins are merely collectibles offered to the buying public by a private company in the business of manufacturing such curiosities.:On 31 August 2007, radio host Hal Turner used images of the Amero tokens offered by Designs Computed as the basis for propagating a patently false tale about his having been given a ""real"" Amero coin on the sly by an anonymous Treasury agent, and that the existence of said coin was ""proof"" that the USA, Canada, and Mexico were ""to be merged into a single new entity"" known as the North American Union.After we (and others) debunked Turner's fictional, outrage-provoking conspiracy theory by pointing out the true origin of the Amero tokens, he began claiming that the Designs Computed site had been hastily erected on the Internet as part of ""a full blown effort to discredit my story and the images as fake.""  That was not the case: Daniel Carr, the entrepreneur behind Designs Computed, has been displaying the coins he has designed on his web site since at least 2000 and has been offering some of them for sale since at least  2005. While his ""Amero"" entry dates only to 2007, the coins depicted thereon fit seamlessly into his catalogue of similar offerings, including his ""parody State Quarters.""

As the Wall Street Journal noted, the e-mails ""appear to show Mrs. Clinton taking a tone in private that is more favorable to free trade and to banks than she has often taken on the campaign trail""::The WikiLeaks documents suggest Clinton campaign research director Tony Carrk emailed excerpts of Mrs. Clinton's speeches to senior campaign officials, including [campaign chairman John] Podesta and communications director Jennifer Palmieri, calling them the ""flags from HRC's paid speeches.""Mr. Carrk said he had obtained the transcripts from ""HWA,"" an apparent reference to the Harry Walker Agency, which arranged Mrs. Clinton's paid speeches after she left the State Department in 2013.""I put some highlights below,"" Mr. Carrk wrote. ""There is a lot of policy positions that we should give an extra scrub with Policy.""In that vein, Clinton did not advocate the creation of a ""hemispheric government"" that would supplant the the United States. Instead, she was expressing pro-trade positions to her audience of business people, saying she dreamed of a ""hemispheric common market, with open trade, not creating a single central ""hemispheric"" government. She made no mention (directly or indirectly) of ""ending the United States as we know it""::My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.The e-mail that contained this wording was sent between Clinton campaign staffers on 25 January 2016, with the following introduction:Team,Attached are the flags from HRC's paid speeches we have from HWA [Harry Walker Agency]. I put some highlights below. There is a lot of policy positions that we should give an extra scrub with Policy.In terms of what was opened to the press and what was not, the Washington Examiner got a hold of one of the private speech contracts (her speeches to universities were typically open press), so this is worth a read.The relevant e-mails can be read on WikiLeaks here.:"
231,231,348.WhatDoestheBeatlesHe,"Claim:The cover of the Beatles' ""Help!"" album shows the group spelling out the word ""help"" in semaphore.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On Aug. 6, 1965, the Beatles issued their fifth LP, ""Help!"", comprising the seven songs featured in their just-released feature film of the same name, plus seven additional tracks. (The U.S. version was offered as a soundtrack album that included only the songs appearing in the film, plus additional incidental music.):In 1965, adventurously offbeat or arty record album covers were rare in the pop music world, and ""Help!"" did not contribute much to breaking that pattern, offering a rather plain display of the group and album names, along with a picture of the Fab Four garbed in clothing they wore while filming skiing sequences in the Austrian Alps for the ""Help!"" movie::But as Beatles fans were wont to do -- especially in the wake of the ""Paul is dead"" rumor that erupted several years later -- enthusiasts scoured all aspects of the band's records for hidden messages and meanings. In this particular case, the rumored secret message was the interesting (if unexciting) claim that the Beatles were posed on the album cover in such a way that their arm positions spelled out H-E-L-P in semaphore.In fact, the Beatles weren't posed in a way that spelled out H-E-L-P, or anything else meaningful, in semaphore. Their arm positions corresponded, at best, to either the sequence N-U-J-V or N-V-U-J, depending upon whether one examined the U.K. or U.S. version of the album (which featured slightly different arrangements of the four group members on their covers)::Photographer Robert Freeman, who shot the cover for ""Help!"" as well as three other Beatles albums, acknowledged that he had initially considered trying to arrange the group shot to spell out H-E-L-P, but in the end he opted to simply go with the positioning that had the best visual appeal -- regardless of meaning:The Beatles were filming a sequence in Austria where they stood on a skyline in the snow waving their arms to a music playback. From this I had the idea of semaphore spelling out the letters HELP. But when we came to do the shot the arrangement of the arms with those letters didn't look good. So we decided to improvise and ended up with the best graphic positioning of the arms.The shot was set up at the film studio near London where the Beatles were finishing the last scenes. They stood on a specially constructed platform with a white painted background wearing the black hats, coats and capes from the film wardrobe. I used a larger format camera to get detail on their faces because of the distance at which the shots were taken.It was a simple, graphic set-up bit. I think the cover would have had more impact with just the Beatles in the white space and no lettering at all. After all, they were at the height of their fame and easily recognizable. What they didn't need was HELP!:In the world of Beatles conspiracy theory, NUJV is sometimes claimed to be an abbreviation for ""New Unknown James Vocalist,"" a reference to the look-alike and sound-alike musician who was supposedly tapped to secretly replace James Paul McCartney after the latter's untimely death in the 1960s."
232,232,316.SnopestionaryWhatWas,"""Gamergate,"" considered by many a watershed event in the ascendancy of extremist personalities and tactics to online prominence, was a coordinated social media harassment campaign that targeted women in and associated with the video game industry, primarily in 2014 and 2015.The relentless, misogynistic verbal attacks -- including death threats, rape threats, swatting attempts, and doxxing -- that characterized the perpetrators were initially aimed at a particular woman who had been publicly accused of infidelity by a former boyfriend. Over time, the same pattern of abuse was directed at other women (and even some men) who were perceived as defending her. This escalating pattern of mob attacks and abuse went on, targeting multiple individuals, for more than a year.Gamergate is regarded as emblematic of the deeply rooted sexist and reactionary attitudes observed not only in the male-dominated gaming industry of that time, but across the internet at large. Two of the platforms from which many of these attacks were launched, 4chan and 8chan (now 8kun), were and are hotbeds of political extremism. Post-Gamergate, the Trump-worshiping QAnon movement, with its vast skein of interlinked conspiracy theories claiming, for example, that prominent Democrats are satanic child sex-traffickers who drink the blood of babies, was born on 4chan and flourished on 8chan. Gamergate laid the groundwork, and in many ways set the tone, for that fanatical movement. :Observers argue that Gamergate's attitudes and tactics live on in the abusive activities of today's online political extremists, who, for example, loose ""Twitter-mobs"" to attack those with whom they disagree, often singling out female influencers for this abuse. Misogyny and anti-feminism are nothing new, but thanks (at least in part) to Gamergate these attitudes gained a purchase on social media that women who work and seek community online -- particularly in news media -- are still forced to reckon with."
233,233,38.MalaysiaAir370Patent,"Claim:Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was made to disappear so one party could gain control of a multiply-owned patent.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared over the South China Sea on 8 March 2014 with 239 persons (227 passengers and 12 crew members) aboard. Several days later, a conspiracy theory was floated on the Internet that four of the passengers on that flight were all co-holders of a recently issued, highly valuable patent and the disappearance of Flight 370 was engineered to eliminate them so that remaining co-holder of the patent could reap all the royalties from it for himself::Example: [Collected via e-mail, March 2014]This was posted on facebook in a discussion of the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight:-------------------------------------------------Here's what you all need to know. Spread this information everywhere:Four days after the missing flight MH370 a patent is approved by the Patent Office4 of the 5 Patent holders are Chinese employees of Freescale Semiconductor of Austin TX.Patent is divided up on 20% increments to 5 holders:Peidong Wang, Suzhou, China, (20%)Zhijun Chen, Suzhou, China, (20%)Zhihong Cheng, Suzhou, China, (20%)Li Ying, Suzhou, China, (20%)Freescale Semiconductor (20%)If a patent holder dies, then the remaining holders equally share the dividends of the deceased if not disputed in a will.:If 4 of the 5 dies, then the remaining 1 Patent holder gets 100% of the wealth of the patent.That remaining live Patent holder is Freescale Semiconductor.Who owns Freescale Semiconductor?Jacob Rothschild through Blackstone (what an interesting name for a company) who owns Freescale.Here is your motive for the missing plane. As all 4 Chinese members of the Patent were passengers on the missing plane, and that patent was the breakthrough. We have entered the future proper, and four men was just murdered so that the last, still living member can keep this for himself to either hide or profit from.The improbabilities of such a theory are numerous. For starters, it's not clear the four men referenced as patent co-holders actually were on Flight 370, as their names (as rendered above) don't appear on the flight manifest. (It's possible that the seeming absence of some matching names from the manifest could be due to slight differences in the transliterations of those persons' names from Chinese to English, however.):Moreover, the patent in question is dated 11 March 2014 and involves a ""system for optimizing number of dies produced on a wafer."" That doesn't sound like a highly valuable, ""breakthrough"" type of patent that would prompt the murder of four people (much less the death of 235 other innocent parties) in order to gain exclusive control of it. It looks to be a patent for a procedure that moderately improves the efficiency of a particular manufacturing process, not something with a huge market base and a vast potential for profit.Additionally, the men listed are not actually the patent holders: they're the inventors/applicants, with the patent itself having been assigned to Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., of Austin, Texas. Presumably Freescale Semiconductor is their employer, and it's typical that engineers working in the employ of companies are required by the terms of their employment to assign ownership of their discoveries and inventions to their employers (and thus usually do not receive royalties from any resulting patents).It's also not a given that if all but one of the co-holders of a patent dies, ""then the remaining one patent holder gets 100% of the wealth of the patent"" as if a patent were some form of tontine to be awarded to the last man standing. Unless prior arrangements had been made in that regard, the share of the patent held by the deceased may pass to his heirs or estate through the usual inheritance process.:Finally, although the Rothschild name may be a talisman for many conspiracy theorists, it isn't true that Jacob Rothschild ""owns"" Freescale Semiconductor. Freescale is a public company whose stock is held, in part, by 152 different institutional shareholders. The Blackstone Group, at which Jacob Rothschild serves as a member of the company's International Advisory Board, is one of the largest of those institutional holders (with over 196 million shares), but the Carlyle Group and TPG Group Holdings both own a number of Freescale shares equal to that held by Blackstone."

It went viral, with over 600,000 likes, nearly 5,000 comments, and 10,000 shares as of this writing. People on social media channels like YouTube and Reddit also made the claim, speaking glowingly of how an intern at a social media company went on to become CEO of a very successful social media app with over a billion monthly users.:Corroborating the viral TikTok video's claims, media outlets also reported that Chew interned at Facebook in the summer 2009 before he graduated from Harvard Business School a year later.Interest in Chew grew after U.S. lawmakers questioned the TikTok CEO for nearly six hours about data security at the massively popular video-sharing app. With reports of Congress and the White House considering a ban on TikTok, some people claimed such a ban was already in place. A Snopes fact-check found that to be false. Soon after the congressional hearing on March 23, claims swirled over one aspect of Chew's background: his internship at Facebook when the social media platform was a startup. This claim is true.Chew also acknowledged that background, writing on his HBS Alumni page in 2020 about how he met his wife, Vivian Kao, while doing internships in California in 2009. Kao interned for Better Place, a clean energy startup. ""I was working for a startup that summer, too,"" said Chew, according to the alumni page. ""It was called Facebook."" :Additionally, many credible media outlets like the AP, BBC, CNBC, The Straits Times, among others, reported that Chew indeed was an intern at the social media giant years before TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, launched it in 2018, after buying Musical.ly the same year. With TikTok emerging as one of the biggest rivals to Meta's Facebook and Instagram, people on social media questioned that background or even suggested a conspiracy theory that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was behind Congress's grilling of Chew.""Not a coincidence that American politicians bribed by rival social media lobbyists suddenly push for banning Tiktok,"" a Facebook user commented on the TikTok CEO's grilling.:As to the claim that Chew was once an intern at Facebook, with reputable media outlets and Chew himself acknowledging it, we rate this claim ""True."""
235,235,393.TweetfromUnitetheRig,"The issuance of an explosive, late-evening tweet from the account of Jason Kessler, organizer of the ""Unite the Right"" rally that ended in fatal violence one week earlier in Charlottesville, Virginia, has prompted a rare condemnation from the entire length and breadth of the United States political spectrum, from extreme left to extreme right.The criticism was earned by the nature of its comments directed at Heather Heyer, the counter-protester who was killed in a vehicular attack during the 11 August rally. The tweet (since deleted) went out at 9:25 P.M. on 18 August 2017::As of this writing, it is still unclear whether Kessler himself actually posted the tweet, which includes a link to the Nazi hate site Daily Stormer, (a source Kessler hadn't typically quoted or referenced in previous tweets, despite his own avowed ""pro-white"" stance). A few hours after that tweet appeared, in fact, Daily Stormer owner Andrew Auernheimer (aka ""Weev"") claimed via Gab (another social media platform) that he had hacked Kessler's Twitter account:In subsequent tweets, Kessler (or whomever was controlling his account) ""repudiated"" the Heather Heyer post, blaming the outburst on stress, drugs, and alcohol: :Not long afterward, the account was locked, then completely deleted.The controversy added another layer of intrigue to what appears to be an ongoing effort by Kessler's former alt-right cohorts to isolate and discredit him in the wake of the disastrous Charlottesville event. A conspiracy theory floated by the likes of Alex Jones, Roger Stone, and others attempted to make the case that Kessler was an agent provocateur of the left (or the ""alt-left"") and the violence-plagued rally was a ""false flag"" operation by George Soros and the so-called ""deep state"" to discredit the right and foment social unrest.Apart from the fact that Kessler was at one time a Barack Obama supporter and evinced a passing interest in the Occupy movement, however, the grounds on which Kessler's detractors have founded their attacks are demonstrably false: Kessler was never an employee of CNN (both CNN and Kessler confirmed this to us), for example, nor did he receive campaign consulting fees from a Democratic Congressional candidate in 2012, nor did he ""suddenly"" convert to an alt-right political stance when President Trump was elected.:The Heather Heyer tweet gave this group a new pretext for disavowing Kessler and pinning the Charlottesville debacle on everyone but the alt-right itself:I will no longer associate w/ Jason Kessler; no one should.

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., as 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's running mate. Rating:FalseAbout this rating A quote ostensibly uttered by Alexander Soros, the son of billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros, has been making its way around social media since at least Aug. 12, 2020. The fictitious quote, which involved Soros saying that it was his -- and in turn his father's -- decision to pick U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., as 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's running mate, was frequently shared with a photograph that social media users claimed was taken right after Soros conducted the final interview in Harris' vetting process::This is a genuine photograph of Soros and Harris, but this quote was fabricated out of whole cloth, and this photograph does not show Soros and Harris after the ""final interview"" before Harris was selected as Biden's running mate. This image was actually taken in March 2019. The above-displayed meme reads::Alexander Soros, son of George Soros, here with Kamala Harris after their final interview in Biden's VP vetting process. ""This was the moment,"" Soros said. ""When I decided she would be the pick. I told my dad and he agreed. The rest was just a formality.""For the uninitiated, George Soros, who is known for giving both verbal and financial support to progressive causes, frequently plays the ""boogeyman"" in right-wing, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. The billionaire philanthropist has been falsely accused of wanting to destroy the United States, of busing people into areas to create chaos and riot, and of being the driving force behind antifa and Black Lives Matter. In general, a section of the population believes that Soros is a ""puppet master"" who is secretly controlling various world events. The above-displayed meme plays into this idea by claiming that Soros' son Alexander is controlling the decisions of the Democratic party.   The above-displayed image was posted by Soros, the deputy chair of the Open Society Foundations, on Aug. 11, 2020, along with a message congratulating Harris on her selection as Biden's 2020 running mate::Soros's post made no mention of a ""vetting interview,"" nor did it include the alleged quote. We also found no news articles, press releases, or interviews with Soros in which he uttered this quote or talked about this supposed meeting. In fact, news articles from outlets such as USA Today and The Associated Press about the ""grueling vetting process"" that took place before Harris' nomination, made no mention of Soros at all. :While Soros shared this image on Aug. 11, this photograph was not taken on that day. This image was actually taken -- and originally posted -- by Soros more than a year earlier, in March 2019. At the time, Harris was still exploring a run for president of the United States and was not being considered by Biden (who had not yet been selected as the Democratic party's nominee) as a vice presidential candidate. In other words, the claim made in this meme is completely bogus. So, where did this claim come from?An Aug. 12, 2020, a number of social media accounts on Twitter and Facebook started to copy and paste the aforementioned text. While we are not entirely sure where the message originated, one user put in plenty of effort to try to get this false rumor to spread. Garth Limburg posted this message at least a dozen times in response to messages posted by news outlets, Biden and Harris, and a number of conservative figures such as Charlie Kirk, Dinesh D'souza, the Trump campaign, Bill Mitchell, and Seb Gorka. While it doesn't appear that Limburg was successful in getting a retweet from any major social media account, near-verbatim copies of this message were picked up and shared uncritically by a number of smaller accounts. :Of course, there's no evidence that Alexander Soros ever said this, nor is there any evidence that Soros had a hand in picking Harris as Biden's running mate. This quote was entirely fabricated to further a conspiracy theory about George Soros (and now his son) controlling politics. "
237,237,222.FraudattheCDCUncover,"Claim:Data suppressed by the CDC proved that the MMR vaccine produces a 340% increased risk of autism in African-American boys.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 24 August 2014 a CNN iReport claiming intentional suppression of data relating to 340% increased risk of autism among specific populations of African-American boys following MMR vaccinations went viral. The story seemed to disappear mysteriously, further fueling the notion that an intentional coverup was underway.:The idea that vaccines lead to autism is not a new conspiracy theory, nor is it a particularly uncommon one. A now heavily discredited study published in the medical journal Lancet in 1998 planted a seed of fear about vaccine safety; and despite efforts to counteract the widespread concern among worried parents, public health officials continue to encounter growing public resistance to vaccination. And the CNN iReport in question was based on a video which featured William Thompson, a senior researcher at the CDC, seemly ""confessing"" to anti-vaccinationist Brian Hooker about a coverup at the CDC and included material such as a claim by Dr. Andrew Wakefield (who in 1998 published a fraudulent research paper claiming a link between MMR vaccine and the appearance of autism and has since been barred from practicing medicine in the UK) asserting that the results of a study proving a link between autism and MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccinations had been ""hidden"" by the CDC:The claim being put forward in the video is that earlier MMR vaccination is associated with an increased risk of autism in African-American boys and that the CDC has spent the last 13 years covering this linkage up. These charges are based the result of a ""reanalysis"" by Brian Hooker in Translational Neurodegeneration entitled ""Measles-mumps-rubella vaccination timing and autism among young african american boys: a reanalysis of CDC data."" The study which has been ""reanalyzed"" is from a study by DeStefano et al in 2004 published in Pediatrics entitled ""Age at first measles-mumps-rubella vaccination in children with autism and school-matched control subjects: a population-based study in metropolitan Atlanta."" That study was a case-control study in which age at first MMR vaccination was compared between autistic ""cases"" and neurotypical controls. Vaccination data were abstracted from immunization forms required for school entry, and records of children who were born in Georgia were linked to Georgia birth certificates for information on maternal and birth factors.:   The second iReport published on 22 August 2014 explicitly claimed that the CDC had been involved in an intentional coverup:William W. Thompson, PhD, Senior Scientist with the CDC has stepped forward and admitted the 2004 paper entitled ""Age at first measles-mumps-rubella vaccination in children with autism and school-matched control subjects: a population-based study in metropolitan Atlanta,"" which has been used repeatedly by the CDC to deny the MMR-autism connection, was a fraud.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14754936Dr. Thompson has admitted the 340% increase in boys receiving the MMR vaccine ""on time,"" as opposed to delayed, was buried by himself, Dr. DeStefano, Dr. Bhasin, Dr. Yeargin-Allsopp, and Dr. Boyle ... Dr. Thompson first called and spoke with Dr. Brian Hooker, who then revealed the information to Dr. Andrew Wakefield and the Autism Media Channel.   On 27 August, Thompson released a statement via law firm Morgan Verkamp, LLC, confirming that he had spoken with Dr. Brian Hooker and that he had ""omitted statistically significant information"" from his study. Titled ""STATEMENT OF WILLIAM W. THOMPSON, Ph.D., REGARDING THE 2004 ARTICLE EXAMINING THE POSSIBILITY OF A RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN  MMR VACCINE AND AUTISM,"" Thompson's statement began::I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information  in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics. The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased risk for autism. Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data were collected, and I believe that the final study protocol was not followed.I want to be absolutely clear that I believe vaccines have saved and continue  to save countless lives. I would never suggest that any parent avoid vaccinating children of any race. Vaccines prevent serious diseases, and the risks associated with their administration are vastly outweighed  by their individual and societal benefits.   What got lost in the brouhaha over Dr. Thompson's ""confession,"" allegations about a ""cover-up"" at the CDC, and threats of whistleblower lawsuits was what should have been the main point: Did collected data actually prove that the MMR vaccine produces a 340% increased risk of autism in African-American boys?  The answer is no, it did not.  :On 27 August 2014, Dr. Hooker's article published in the journal Translational Neurodegeneration that concluded ""African American males receiving the MMR vaccine prior to 24 months of age or 36 months of age are more likely to receive an autism diagnosis"" was removed from public domain due to issues of conflict of interest and the questionable validity of its methods:The Editor and Publisher regretfully retract the article as there were undeclared competing interests on the part of the author which compromised the peer review process. Furthermore, post-publication peer review raised concerns about the validity of the methods and statistical analysis, therefore the Editors no longer have confidence in the soundness of the findings.   The CDC issued a statement regarding the data in question, with instructions for accessing the study at the center of the controversy.  As the CDC noted, the authors of that study suggested that the most likely explanation for the moderate correlation between autism and vaccination in young children was the existence of immunization requirements for autistic children enrolled in special education preschool programs::Access to the information on the birth certificates allowed researchers to assess more complete information on race as well as other important characteristics, including possible risk factors for autism such as the child's birth weight, mother's age, and education. This information was not available for the children without birth certificates; hence CDC study did not present data by race on black, white, or other race children from the whole study sample. It presented the results on black and white/other race children from the group with birth certificates.The study looked at different age groups: children vaccinated by 18 months, 24 months, and 36 months. The findings revealed that vaccination between 24 and 36 months was slightly more common among children with autism, and that association was strongest among children 3-5 years of age. The authors reported this finding was most likely a result of immunization requirements for preschool special education program attendance in children with autism.   For a thorough analysis of the flaws and misinformation associated with the current CDC autism ""cover-up"" conspiracy theory, we recommend the posts on the subject at ScienceBlogs, which note of the claim at the heart of this matter (i.e, allegedly suppressed proof of a 340% increased risk of autism in African-American boys after MMR vaccination) that::Vaccination data were abstracted from immunization forms required for school entry, and records of children who were born in Georgia were linked to Georgia birth certificates for information on maternal and birth factors. Basically, no significant associations were found between the age cutoffs examined and the risk of autism. I note that, even in the ""reanalysis"" by Brian Hooker, there still isn't any such correlation for children who are not African American boysSo is Hooker's result valid? Was there really a 3.36-fold increased risk for autism in African-American males who received MMR vaccination before the age of 36 months in this dataset? Hooker [performed] multiple subset analyses, which, of course, are prone to false positives. As we say, if you slice and dice the evidence more and more finely, eventually you will find apparent correlations that might or might not be real. In this case, I doubt Hooker's correlation is real. There's no biologically plausible reason why there would be an effect observed in African-Americans but no other race and, more specifically than that, in African-American males. In the discussion, Hooker does a bunch of handwaving about lower vitamin D levels and the like in African American boys, but there really isn't a biologically plausible mechanism to account for his observation, suggesting that it's probably spurious. There are multiple other studies, many much larger than this one, that failed to find a correlation between MMR and autism. What [Hooker] has done, apparently, is found grist for a perfect conspiracy theory to demonize the CDC, play the race card in a truly despicable fashion, and cast fear, uncertainty, and doubt about the CDC vaccination program, knowing that most of the white antivaccine activists who support [him] hate the CDC so much that they won't notice that even Hooker's reanalysis doesn't support their belief that vaccines caused the autism in their children.:   Last updated:   3 February 2015"

The claim that Biden was using a green screen (a device used in movies and TV to alter the background) is based on an odd visual in this video when Biden's hand appears to come in front of a fuzzy grey microphone. This rumor was popular on the r/conspiracy section of Reddit, but it was also spread by retired athletes and popular conservative social media personalities such as Aubrey Huff and Tito Ortiz. Huff wrote: ""@JoeBiden taking questions in front of the green screen. Notice the hand going right through the microphone. It's all a big production.....and so many of you are falling for it. Wake up!""While this visual may look a little odd, the claim that it shows Biden using a green screen quickly falls apart upon closer examination. For starters, it's important to note that the microphones in this video are being held by boom poles. While we might be accustomed to seeing reporters holding their own microphones, social distance protocols due to the COVID-19 pandemic have forced reporters to start using boom mics. These mics are also larger than some might anticipate, as illustrated by the photograph at the top of this article provides.:In other words, Biden is standing directly in front of several large boom mics, but is still several feet away from the reporters. When it appears that Biden's hand crosses over the microphone, it's because it actually does, it just looks a little funny because the mics are both larger than anticipated and at a different distance than expected. Here's a diagram from Captain Disillusion, a visual effects specialist, to better illustrate this point::Here's another angle of this purported ""green screen"" moment from The Washington Post:https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/biden-does-not-plan-to-travel-to-border-amid-migrant-surge/2021/03/16/d991feff-9f5b-4644-98c9-5fc3588a3c18_video.htmlSteve Herman, the reporter who was holding the fuzzy grey microphone in this video, posted a message on Twitter saying that he was ""literally in front"" of the president when this video was filmed. In other words, Herman and Biden were both together on the south lawn of the White House, not in a studio with a green screen. : The claim that Biden was speaking in front of a green screen is part of a larger conspiracy theory holding that Biden presidency is being ""faked"" in one manner or another.Last month, for example, we addressed the false rumors that photographs showed Biden on a movie set and not in the Oval Office, and just after Biden's inauguration, a rumor circulated that the president was using a ""fake"" Air Force One plane. While some people may not want to believe it, Biden is real and he is really the President of the United States. "
240,240,249.ConvictedCharlestonS,"Claim:Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof is actually a former child star and crisis actor named John Christian Graas.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In December 2016, 22-year-old Dylann Roof was convicted on 33 federal hate crimes counts related to the June 2015 Charleston church shooting that left nine people dead.  The news of his conviction revived a June 2015 conspiracy theory that the Roof was not who he was claimed to be, but rather was a former child star and crisis actor named John Christian Graas.:A constellation of ""crisis actor"" rumors widely entered mainstream conspiracy theory after the Sandy Hook school shootings of 2012. Shortly after news of that earlier massacre broke, multiple persons connected to the tragedy (typically family members of dead victims) were accused of being crisis actors (i.e., professional actors supposedly engaged by government agencies and the news media to deceive the public about the reality of allegedly staged (also known as ""false flag"") events, hired to convincingly portray persons in the throes of trauma and suffering).After Sandy Hook, iterations of the ""crisis actor"" claim were attached by online conspiracy buffs to virtually every subsequent mass shooting event, with numerous truthers attempting to ""out"" these potential ""plants"" by matching them up with images of persons who had no connection to those events.The Charleston church massacre took place on 17 June 2015, and in less than a week conspiracy theorists were asserting that accused shooter Dylann Roof was actually John Christian Graas, a former child actor who had appeared in several films and episodes of numerous television series (and who, according to the Internet Movie Database, enlisted as a U.S. Marine in 2010).:One early version of the rumor held:There's been tons of speculation in regards to the Charleston shooting rampage.Was this another False Flag to distract and terrorize the masses?What would be gained from such an event?In this video you are about to watch, you will see hard core evidence that the shooter is really 33 year old John Christian Graas, Hollywood child actor and US Marine aviator as of 2010 and on US Marine register as of 2013.:The associated video clip documented only that Graas and Dylann Roof bore a passing resemblance to one another, its ""hardcore evidence"" hinging on facial similarities between Roof at the time of his 2015 arrest and Graas as a young boy in the early 1990s::(We could find no post-childhood photographs of Graas to use in a more relevant comparison.)Central to the conspiracy theory was Roof's ""bowl"" haircut, atypical for a man his age (21 at the time of his arrest) but common for a young boy such as Graas was during his acting career. Roof and the younger Graas both had a similar lip shape, but their noses were not similar, and while Roof appeared to have light green or blue eyes, photographs of Graas looked to depict a boy with dark hazel or brown eyes. (That latter discrepancy was typically shaded by contrasting color photographs of Graas with black-and-white images of Roof.) The shape of Grass and Roof's eyes also visibly differed.Another glaring hole in the conspiracy involved the respective ages and histories of the two men. While Roof was 21 in the photographs used as a comparison, Graas was at least 33 when the rumors that he was acting the part of shooter ""Dylann Roof"" first circulated. Roof was not born until April 1994, when Graas was already at the height of his childhood acting career:::Graas continued to work steadily through at least 1999, around the time Roof would have been entering kindergarten, and was reported as having enlisted in the Marines in 2010. Roof's early life was thoroughly investigated after the shooting and documented an individual who had been on the grid during that period of time (not a persona that had suddenly been ""created"" around the time of the Charleston shooting).In profiles published after the shooting, references to Roof were found in 2008 court papers (related to a parent's divorce) that appeared alongside descriptions of his school records. Childhood friends also placed Roof in the school system and attested to relationships with him years earlier:When Roof reconnected with his childhood friend [Joey] Meek [in May 2015], something in him had changed ... they lost contact [around 2011], Meek said. When Roof contacted him, Meek said he welcomed his childhood friend into his home.But Roof was not the same friend Meek had known from their childhood. Roof always had been quiet, Meek said, but this time he was different.""I was trying to just treat him like he was the same friend and treat him like he was the same person,"" Meek said in an interview with The State newspaper last week. ""But people can change in that short time, and I just didn't see it"" while it was happening.Meek was one of the first to call law enforcement June 18 [2015] after he saw the surveillance images released of Roof before his capture.:Family members also provided accounts of Roof's early and later life to news outlets, many describing his alarmingly rapid transition from a young man with black friends to someone absorbed by white nationalist sentiments:The people who know Dylann Storm Roof -- the people who watched his progression from a sweet child to a disturbed man -- are struggling with guilt. [T]alk to his friends and family, and a portrait emerges of a troubled and confused 21-year-old, often drunk and occasionally threatening as he alternated between partying with black friends and spouting white power slogans to white friends. Court documents and nearly two dozen interviews show Roof's early childhood was troubled and confused as well, as he grew up in an unstable, broken home amid allegations of marital abuse and infidelity.As a 4-year-old, ""He was so sweet and bright,"" recalls Patricia Hastings, who was once his step-grandmother.Seventeen years later, she is among many who are trying to figure out what happened to Dylann Roof ... There is little dispute his childhood was difficult ... In an affidavit filed in her 2009 divorce, [Roof's former stepmother Paige Hastings/Mann] said she became a surrogate mother to the children: ""I raised [Roof's father's] kids from a very young age, took them to all of their activities."":[Former step-grandmother] Patricia Hastings said her daughter loved Dylann and Amber ""unconditionally as her own."" She said [biological mother] Amy Roof would leave them in Paige's care with little notice, even though Paige had her own new baby, their half-sister Morgan.Paige cut Dylann's hair in the bowl cut he still wears; she took Amber to college orientation because ""both parents were unavailable,"" Paige's friend Leslie McArver wrote in an affidavit.As he grew, Dylann exhibited obsessive compulsive behavior, Hastings said. He would obsess over germs, and insisted on having his hair cut in that same style, Hastings said ... After Paige filed for divorce, Franklin Roof hired a private investigator to shadow her, revealing she was having an affair, according to the court documents ... The divorce was granted in 2009. Hastings recalls that her daughter told her she felt guilty leaving Dylann.Roof began having trouble in school. He failed the ninth grade twice, then dropped out for good in 2010.:According to Patricia Hastings, recounting [2015] conversations with her daughter, Roof was quieter than he used to be; he looked distant, lost. He was no longer the sweet blond kid she helped raise for nearly a decade. As she was getting ready to leave, Roof, not one for affection, hugged her tight.""It was like he was saying goodbye,"" Hastings said ... The next time Mann saw him, it was on television as the man accused of the killings.Roof's former schools and his school records and acquaintances were also examined and reported on in mid-2015:[N]othing in the records, and nothing in his friends' memories, offer a clear explanation to the question haunting South Carolina and the nation: How did the silent young man with no record of violence in his past come to be accused of killing nine people who had gathered to pray?""When he opened up, you could tell something was wrong at home. He wasn't at peace,"" said Taliaferro Robinson-Heyward, who attended middle school with Mr. Roof. ""It wasn't like he was a mean person, but you could tell he had a darkness to his life."":The Lexington School District, where Mr. Roof attended fourth, eighth and ninth grades, described him as a ""very transient student.""""I remember him as somewhat shy, and that he never penetrated into the 'in' crowd,"" said Ted Wachter, the retired principal of Rosewood Elementary School, where Mr. Roof attended fifth grade.Mr. Robinson-Heyward, who is black, said he saw little evidence of bigotry in the young Dylann. ""To me, in the seventh grade, he saw black just as he saw white, you know,"" said Mr. Robinson-Heyward ... Another childhood friend, Caleb Brown, recalled a class assignment that required students to go home and ask about their heritage ... With a child's inquisitiveness, Mr. Roof asked his mixed-race friend, who had darker skin and curly hair, about his background and learned that Mr. Brown's father was black.""That didn't change his behavior toward me,"" Mr. Brown said in an interview.The boys became friends at the behest of their mothers, having sleepovers, skateboarding and playing Nascar racing video games. Mr. Brown recalled Mr. Roof's mother being welcoming and tolerant of all of races.:""He wasn't the most popular kid, but he wasn't upset about that,"" Mr. Brown said ... Several of Mr. Roof's friends said he often complained that his father put him to work landscaping. Even in his youth, Mr. Roof began to exhibit a greater interest in smoking grass than cutting it. At 13, [in approximately 2007] his mother caught him spending $50 he had earned landscaping on marijuana, Ms. Konzny said ... family turmoil took place at about the time Mr. Roof was entering ninth grade in Lexington. School records show he repeated the grade, completing the last three months of his second stint of ninth grade back in Columbia, in 2010.Visual evidence presented to bolster the theory that Dylann Roof was child actor John Christian Graas was extremely weak, consisting largely of cherry-picked images showing Roof's child-like haircut contrasted with that of an actual child. But the details of Roof's childhood (which differ substantially from those of the much-older John Christian Graas) are far more more compelling evidence against the ""crisis actor"" theory than shaky picture comparisons are evidence for it."

Among topics sparked by the introduction of Julia were claims by opponents of vaccination that the character serves as propaganda engineered by pharmaceutical companies to normalize autism, which is called ""vaccine injury"" in those circles.Claims vaccines caused autism have long been proved false, but it is true that some opponents of vaccination believe that Julia's introduction to the show is the result of a push by pharmaceutical companies:::Shortly after Sesame Workshop announced the new character in October 2015, vaccine opponents raised the same concerns:In October 2015, conspiracy and alternative health site Natural News' ""Health Ranger"" Mike Adams published an blog post accusing Sesame Street of tacitly promoting vaccines to ""normalize"" autism with the introduction of Julia (and reiterating an old conspiracy theory about a purported data coverup at the CDC)::In yet another sickening example of the absolute mental derangement of modern society, Sesame Street has rolled out its first autistic muppet named ""Julia,"" says the Sesame Street websiteThe rollout of autistic Julia is Sesame Street's attempt to ""normalize"" vaccine injuries and depict those victimized by vaccines as happy, ""amazing"" children rather than admitting the truth that vaccines cause autism in some children and we should therefore make vaccines safer and less frequent to save those children from a lifetime of neurological damage.The fact that vaccines are linked to autism was openly admitted by top CDC scientist Dr. William Thompson, who admitted to taking part in a scientific fraud scheme involving numerous CDC officials. In the name of ""vaccine science,"" they actively altered data to eliminate the statistical link between vaccines and autism in African-American boys, thereby condemning millions of young black babies to a life of permanent neurological damage. #BlackLivesDONTmatter to the vaccine industry, it seems.Sesame Street's rollout of the character Julia (including an appearance on morning chat show The View) continues to draw persistent backlash, despite Sesame Workshop's description of Julia's introduction as ""an initiative designed to reduce the stigma surrounding autism.""

242,242,529.DidArmedTrumpSupport,"Claim:Armed supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump harassed a Biden-Harris campaign bus in Texas, leading to the cancellation of three campaign events and a news conference.Rating:Mostly TrueAbout this rating What's TrueVehicles, mostly pickup trucks flying flags in support of President Donald Trump, were seen driving near a Biden-Harris campaign bus on a highway in Texas. A video showed that at least one truck moved in front of the bus, appearing to slow its speed. A Trump supporter also admitted on Facebook to ""slamming"" a white SUV that appeared to accompany the campaign bus. The Trump supporters organized in an Alamo City Trump Train Facebook group, where several members discussed being armed.What's FalseNeither Joe Biden nor Kamala Harris were on the bus, as some tweets claimed.What's UndeterminedThere are conflicting reports over whether a Biden-Harris rally in downtown Austin was called off because of the incident. However, two other events and a news conference were canceled for ""safety concerns."":Update (Nov. 2, 2020): This story's rating was changed from Mixture to Mostly True after new evidence came to light.On Friday Oct. 30, 2020, video was shared on social media that showed a Biden-Harris bus surrounded by pickup trucks flying flags in support of U.S. President Donald Trump on Interstate 35 in Texas. A white pickup truck appeared to slowly pull in front of the bus to slow its speed. Seconds later, a dark-colored truck and a white SUV that appeared to accompany the campaign bus can be seen side-swiping each other. :The SUV appeared to be over the highway road line. However, another angle in a video reposted by NowThis (beginning at 1:20) showed the bus appeared to be changing to the right lane, and when the white SUV attempted to also change lanes, the dark-colored truck sped up and braked behind the bus to not allow the white SUV over. Brake lights are visible on the dark-colored truck at the 1:24 mark in the NowThis video. (An extended video in a newer Snopes story sheds new light on the clash between the two vehicles.)The white SUV can be seen in another video sharing a lane with a white truck with Trump flags, and in a different video on Facebook as well. A photograph purported to show the same white SUV with damage after the incident::A Facebook user named Eliazar Cisneros posted a video of the ""Trump Train."" He also claimed to be the driver of the truck that clashed with the white SUV, later making another post, and commenting: ""That was me slamming that fucker.... Hell yea."" In the same comments, he said, ""he hit me,"" referring to the white SUV, and also said: ""I reacted because he was running me off the road.""Cisneros also reacted with a laughing emoji when someone commented on one of his posts telling him he should have an ""All Lives Splatter"" bumper sticker that also says: ""Keep your ass out of the road,"" referring to past Black Lives Matter protests that have blocked freeways.Texas Tribune reported that the FBI is looking into the campaign-bus incident, and that the group of Trump supporters used Facebook to organize their movements: ""Naomi Narvaiz, a Texas Republican Party official in San Marcos, said Trump supporters formed the convoy after learning of the bus's movements up the interstate on Facebook from fellow supporters in San Antonio."":On Oct. 30, Cisneros posted a link to Alamo Trump City Train, a private Facebook group with about 3,500 members. The group's description read ""We Ride with Pride,"" and said:The Alamo City Trump Train is the loud roar of the silent majority. The purpose of the group is to unite patriots from San Antonio and surrounding areas and join together to show our support for President Trump and for conservative values. The group is also meant to give fellow patriots a place to meet and build long lasting friendships with like-minded individuals. With the success of the New Braunfels Trump Train, it's time for San Antonio to step up and let our city know that WE ARE THE MAJORITY!The group was created on Sept. 1, 2020, and as of Nov. 1, it had nearly 300 new posts just in the previous 24 hours, and added 1,032 new members just in the previous seven days.On the Alamo City Trump Train YouTube channel, one video specifically highlighted a truck with a trailer with signage reading, ""The Great Awakening"" and ""WWG1WGA."" Both signs refer to QAnon conspiracy theory slogans, including ""WWG1WGA,"" which means ""Where We Go One We Go All."" The same truck appeared to show up in another video from a different event with the same QAnon signage. Some trucks also had signage that read: ""Trump 2020 Fuck Your Feelings."" (Our newer story details much more of the QAnon activity within the group.):Eric Cervini posted the video at the beginning of this story. The Tribune reported: ""Eric Cervini, a volunteer for the Biden campaign who grew up in Round Rock and flew in from Los Angeles, said he was driving on I-35 from San Antonio to the next event when he saw a long line of 40-50 vehicles along the side of the highway with Trump and American flags.""::KEYE television reporter Jordan Bontke reported: ""The Biden bus has also been closely followed by Trump supporters while on the road, though Texas Democrats insist their presence didn't affect their decision to call off the downtown Austin rally."" A story from The Washington Post appeared to report the opposite. :While the downtown Austin rally did not appear to have been canceled because of the incident, the Tribune reported that ""safety concerns"" were cited as the reason for the cancellation of two campaign events in Pflugerville and San Marcos, as well as a news conference.Trump tweeted his approval of the ""Trump Train""::CBS DFW reported: ""Rep. Rafael Anchia, a Dallas Democrat who chairs the Mexican American Legislative Caucus, tweeted that the Trump supporters were 'armed' and 'ramming volunteer vehicles & blocking traffic for 40 mins.'"" Cervini also mentioned that the pickup truck drivers were ""armed.""When we initially published this story, we had been unable to find any photographic or documentary evidence that the Trump supporters in the pickup trucks were armed. However, inside the private Facebook group we noted that multiple members made comments that mentioned they were armed. Details and screenshots are available within the newer story. Finally, many Twitter users believed that Biden and/or Harris were on the bus. For example:::However, CBS DFW reported, ""Neither Biden nor his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, were on the bus.""This story is developing and will be updated further should any new evidence come to light."

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.In 16th-century Britain a common saying to describe hoaxing someone was ""to make one believe the Moon is made of green cheese"". Absurd, of course. So perhaps people were more credulous by the middle of the 19th century, when a newspaper editor perpetrated what became known as the Great Moon Hoax, persuading gullible readers that on the Moon you could find unicorns and other fantastic beasts. The Great Moon Hoax refers to six articles in the New York Sun headlined ""Great Astronomical Discoveries"" and allegedly reprinted from The Edinburgh Journal of Science. Beginning on August 25 1835, they revealed a lunar ecology and civilisation. The hoax tested the parameters of media credibility and ""fake news"" in the pre-telegraphic age. The stories circulated to other papers around the world. The newspaper published these supposed reports from observations by astronomer royal, John Herschel, using the most powerful telescope yet invented. According to the reports, this telescope was connected to an ""oxy-hydrogen"" projector which enabled it to screen moving pictures. They visualised forests, seas and vast deposits of precious minerals, teeming with life forms, including unicorns, intelligent beavers and ""man-bats"" (Vespertilio-homo). These flew around naked and worshipped in triangular temples. :The wonders of the moon were revealed ever more sensationally, until the telescope apparently caught fire - its enormous lens exposed to South African sunlight acting as a ""burning glass"".New York Sun reporter Richard Adams Locke (1800-1871) later admitted writing the articles, satirising speculations by the Rev Thomas Dick (1774-1857), the most widely read popular astronomer on both sides of the Atlantic at the time, who kept to what he saw as a literal interpretation of the Bible's account of creation. This despite geological finds dating back into ""deep time"" and Charles Darwin's observations about evolution offering evidence to the contrary. So Locke's descriptions of the planets - and even the Sun - included details about populations of ""unfallen"" beings that God had put there - as the Bible told the story, it was only Earth that had been corrupted by ""original sin"". It was Locke's way of satirising what he called Dick's naive ""science fiction"".The Moon Hoax is a significant event in Dundee's cultural history - but also science fiction in general. It's a springboard for issues still topical today: clashes between cosmic views of faith and science as well as the growth and power of modern media and their relationship with public trust, facts and imagination. :Googling ""moon hoax"" immediately directs you to internet conspiracy theory sites dismissing NASA's 1969 landing as simulated, ironically inverting debates sparked in 1835 by dismissing documented facts as mere fictions.Science and religionDick's The Christian Philosopher, or the Connexion of Science and Philosophy with Religion (1823) predicted that signs of ""lunarian"" life would soon be detected once telescopes could observe them in sufficiently close-up detail. He devoted himself to scientific, philosophical and religious works, acquiring widespread popularity and influence among politicians, writers and thinkers, particularly in the evangelical United States.The main players: Richard Adams Locke, Sir John Herschel and the Rev Thomas Dick.University of Dundee, Author providedDick promoted the ""plurality of worlds"" - the theory that every planet must be inhabited because the divine plan would never create without purpose. His magnum opus Celestial Scenery or The Wonders of the Planetary System Displayed (1838) showcased this, calculating our solar system contained more than 21 trillion inhabitants. He based this calculation on planetary surface areas multiplied by English population density. Hence the Moon might contain ""beings far more numerous, and perhaps more elevated in the scale of intellect, than the inhabitants of our globe"".:Ironically, Celestial Scenery also rebuked the Hoax author's disregard for facts:The ""Law of Truth"" ought never for a moment to be sported with ... It is to be hoped that the author of the deception to which I have adverted, as he advances in years and wisdom, will perceive the folly and immorality of such conduct.Locke responded with an open broadside: So far from feeling that I deserve the coarse reproaches of Dr Dick, I think it quite laudable in any man to satirise ... that school of crude speculation and cant of which he is so eminent a professor. New genreLocke's lunar paradise hoodwinked a global readership because of expectations raised in the popular imagination by Dick's ""outrage upon science"", which prepared them ""to swallow any thing however absurd ... recommended by this peculiar stamp"".::A German lithograph purporting to show Herschel's apparatus and its method of projection.University of Dundee, Author providedThough not destroying Dick's reputation, the hoax challenged his prioritisation of belief over evidence, foreshadowing the fundamental intellectual crises of the mid-Victorian age. Nevertheless, Dick continued to popularise science and democratise access to astronomy. Dundee's unique public observatory is a bequest from one of Dick's devotees, John Mills.Whether or not Dick's speculations constituted science fiction, they inadvertently midwifed the modern genre through Locke's parodies. The editor and owner of the New York Herald, James Gordon Bennett, credited Locke with inventing what he called ""A New Species of Writing"" - ""the scientific novel"". The Dundee Moon Hoax certainly inspired the ""lost Scottish father"" of American sci-fi, Robert Duncan Milne who grew up in nearby Cupar in the 1840s. His own tales of astronomical discovery bear many similarities to Locke's lunar utopia. It provided a rich context which shaped Milne's imagination, driven by creative tensions between scientific secularism, fantastic new technologies and orthodox beliefs.:Keith Williams, Senior Lecturer in English, University of DundeeThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

244,244,207.IsPedophiliaConsider,"Claim:Pedophilia is considered a disability in Greece. Rating:FalseAbout this rating In July 2020, some social media users started to spread an old rumor about pedophilia being classified as a disability in Greece. Former MLB player Aubrey Huff, for instance, shared the following message on Twitter:Pedophilia is not classified as a disability in Greece. :This rumor stems from a proposal by the Greek government in January 2012 to expand its disability list to include various behavioral disorders, such as gambling and pyromania. This proposal also would have also categorized pedophilia as a disability. At the time, a number of news outlets published articles about the proposed changes and noted that disability groups were ""outraged"" about the idea. The BBC wrote:A Greek government plan to categorise paedophiles and pyromaniacs as ""disabled"" has alarmed disability groups, who fear it could undermine their state benefits.[...]Mr Vardakastanis, head of the National Confederation of Disabled People, said the new code would simplify the definition of disability, limiting it to medical conditions.""Disability is if society doesn't give you what you need to be like others. We want the Greek government to really protect vulnerable groups from getting deeper into poverty, exclusion and discrimination.""The new government ""disability"" list also includes compulsive gamblers, fetishists, exhibitionists and sado-masochists, the Associated Press news agency reports.:The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs in Greece said that they were adding categories to their disabilities list for the purpose of medical assessment. The inclusion on this list, contrary to Huff's claim, did not entitle pedophiles to government benefits. This is a bit of a moot point, however, as this change never came to fruition.While we found dozens of news articles from January 2012 about this proposed change, as well as the outrage it generated, we found practically no coverage of the fact that pedophilia was removed from this disability list a few months later. In October 2012, Greece's National Confederation of Persons with Disabilities published a press release stating that ""significant positive changes"" had been made after a new assessment and that pedophilia had been removed from the Disability Identification Table.Here's an excerpt from the press release (translated via Google)::With stubbornness, synergy, perseverance and militancy, ES.AmeA claimed the reform of the new Disability Determination Table as it was published in the Government Gazette 2611 / TBD in November 2011. The new Table published in the Government Gazette 1506 / TBD / 4-5-2012 contains significant positive changes in disability rates of severe permanent disability categories.[...]Pedophilia, pyromania, voyeurism, ostentation, sadomasochism, after the huge upheaval that occurred throughout Greek society were removed from the new Disability Identification Table.We reached out to the National Confederation of Persons with Disabilities for more information. A spokesperson told us that while pedophilia was included in a ""draft list"" of disabilities, it was never officially added to the list. It should also be noted that it is illegal in Greece, as well as much of the rest of the world, for an adult to engage in sexual activity with a minor. The age of consent in Greece is 15-years-old. This isn't particularly unusual. Countries such as France, Iceland, Sweden, and Poland have similar ages of consent. The United Kingdom, Canada, Spain, as well several states in the United States, have an age of consent of 16-years-old. :So why are we talking about pedophilia laws in Greece in July 2020? And why are we talking about a 2012 proposal that never actually came to fruition? As strange as it may sound, this false claim can be traced back to a bizarre and false conspiracy theory about actor Tom Hanks.The Oscar-winning actor, as long with several other Hollywood celebrities, have been baselessly accused of running a child sex-trafficking ring by followers of the ""QAnon"" conspiracy theory. When Hanks and wife Rita Wilson announced that they had officially become Greek citizens in July 2020 -- they now hold dual citizenship in the United States and Greece -- conspiracy theorists started to claim without evidence that Hanks made this decision to ""escape"" the law. There's absolutely no truth to this claim. In addition, as we noted above, pedophilia is illegal in Greece. The rumor that pedophilia is merely a disability in the country stems from a controversial proposal in 2012 to add pedophilia to the country's list of disabilities. This proposal was short lived, however, as pedophilia was removed from this list a few months later. :"
245,245,447.ObamaandClintonHaveI,"Claim:Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have ""Iranian advisers by their sides at all times.""Rating:FalseAbout this rating This image questioning the peculiarity of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama having ""Iranian advisers by their sides at all times"" misses the mark badly in that neither of the persons it pictures -- Valerie Jarrett and Huma Abedin -- is Iranian. The former is the child of two American-born U.S. citizens, and the latter is the American-born daughter of immigrants from India and Pakistan.Valerie Jarrett is one of Barack Obama's top advisers, but neither she nor her parents are Iranian, lives in Iran, or (as far as well can tell) are Muslims. Jarrett's parents, James E. Bowman and Barbara Taylor Bowman, were both American-born U.S. citizens; the couple merely lived in Iran for about six years in the late 1950s and early 1960s while James (a doctor) served as chair of pathology at Nemazee Hospital in Shiraz as part of a program that sent American physicians to developing countries. Valerie was born in Shiraz, but she returned to the U.S. at age 5 with her parents in 1962, and her parents spent the rest of their working lives residing in the Chicago area (as did Valerie until she joined the Obama administration in 2008). James Bowman passed away in Chicago in 2011, while Barbara Bowman still lives in the Windy City. We've found no evidence that Valerie Jarrett is a Muslim, her only apparent connection to that religion being that she lived in a predominantly Muslim country with American parents for the first few years of her life.Huma Mahmood Abedin is a long-time aide to Hillary Clinton who served as Deputy Chief of Staff at the State Department while Clinton was Secretary of State from 2009-2013; she is also the wife of former Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner of New York. Abedin is the American-born daughter of an Indian father and a Pakistani mother who was raised in Saudi Arabia and identifies as a practicing Muslim. Rumors that her late father, her mother, and her brother were all ""connected"" to Muslim Brotherhood were promulgated by former Republican Congresswoman Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, who in June 2012 sent a letter to the Deputy Inspector General at the Department of State asserting that ""infomation has recently come to light that raises serious questions about Department of State policies and activities that appear to be a result of influence operations conducted by individuals and organizations associated with the Muslim Brotherhood."" Bachmann cited as proof of these ""influence operations"" the example that ""the Department's Deputy Chief of Staff, Huma Abedin, has three family members -- her late father, her mother and her brother -- connected to Muslim Brotherhood operatives and/or organizations. Her position affords her routine access to the Secretary and to policy-making.""Bachmann's fellow Republican John McCain took umbrage at her claims about Abedin and condemned them on the floor of the U.S. Senate as having ""no logic, no basis and no merit"":Huma Abedin, a Muslim and the deputy chief of staff and aide to Clinton, has been accused by former presidential candidate Michele Bachmann and four other House Republicans of being connected to a conspiracy theory that the Muslim Brotherhood is trying to infiltrate the highest levels of the U.S. government.A somber McCain rose in her defense -- not just to support a friend but also to take on fringe voices in his own party. It was a familiar role for McCain, who built a reputation as a maverick with a willingness to criticize what he believes are radical views within his party.""Rarely do I come to the floor of this institution to discuss particular individuals,"" McCain said at the beginning of his remarks. ""But I understand how painful and injurious it is when a person's character, reputation and patriotism are attacked without concern for fact or fairness.""McCain called Abedin a friend and a devoted public servant, and denounced what he called ""sinister"" accusations. The charges ""are nothing less than an unwarranted and unfounded attack on an honorable woman, a dedicated American and a loyal public servant,"" McCain said. ""These attacks on Huma have no logic, no basis and no merit. And they need to stop now.""In an interview following his speech, McCain said he learned about Bachmann's inquiry and felt compelled to correct the record.""It's not as if [Huma Abedin]'s somebody I ran into, we've actually traveled to different places with Secretary Clinton, so we're close personal friends,"" McCain said. He recalled traveling with Clinton and Abedin to Afghanistan, Iraq, Latvia -- even the archipelago of Svalbard near the Arctic Circle.:"
246,246,7.TheMattressFirmMoney,"On May 25, 2021, a meme was reposted in a TikTok video that claimed ""Mattress Firm is a money-laundering scheme."" :Conspiracy theorists have alleged the notion for years. The idea that the company was purportedly involved in criminal activity mainly revolved around one thing: In many cities, the company sometimes has multiple stores near each other. Courtesy: The Times of Northwest Indiana/Newspapers.com (2015)In the course of our research, we found past reporting that indicated the conspiracy theorists might have confused money laundering with other actual pressing matters from 2009, 2017, and 2018. The most recent scheme purportedly involved bribery, kickbacks, and fraud at the company.:This story will first concentrate on those three matters, then explore some of the specifics of the conspiracy theory that were presented in the meme.2009: '$36 Million'The oldest scheme we could find involved a Mattress Firm executive and $36 million. Forbes reported that Gary D. White, a former in-house vice president, was sued by the company in 2009 for activity that occurred between 2004 and 2008. White died in 2016. The case did not involve money laundering.In 2009, Mattress Firm sued its former in-house vice president of real estate, Gary D. White, along with a Texas-area developer and a flooring company. The retailer accused the trio of padding up to an extra dollar per SF for every new Mattress Firm store and remodel job from 2004 until 2008. The total contracts amounted to more than $36M during the course of the scheme, Mattress Firm alleged.Mattress Firm dismissed its claims against the developer and flooring company in late 2009, according to documents. It was unclear if the parties settled. White himself later filed for bankruptcy in Texas. It was unclear as of press time if he settled with Mattress Firm.:2017: Steinhoff InternationalThe Mattress Firm money laundering conspiracy theory may have originated in a popular Reddit comment that was posted on Jan. 22, 2018.The top-voted reply under the comment claimed: ""Surprise! Mattress Firm is owned by Steinhoff, which is currently embroiled in a money laundering saga."" However, this did not appear to be accurate.In August 2016, CNBC reported that Steinhoff International, a South African company, purchased Mattress Firm. At the time, Mattress Firm operated more than 3,600 stores.In December 2017, Steinhoff International revealed ""accounting irregularities,"" according to Fin24. However, the reporting mentioned nothing about the company's being ""embroiled in a money laundering saga,"" as alleged by the Reddit comment reply. Rather, it was ""accounting fraud,"" according to Reuters.:Reuters explained: ""Steinhoff said investigators found that top management figures entered into fictitious transactions with entities purported to be independent third parties to create the illusion of income used to hide losses at the company's operating units.""The ""illusion of income used to hide losses"" did not appear to indicate anything about money laundering. The point of money laundering is to funnel an abundance of currency through a safe intermediary to obscure the reality of where the funds originated. According to the reporting, Steinhoff had a lack of money, not an abundance of it. Further, the story made no mention of Mattress Firm.The response to the Reddit comment reply was later edited: ""EDIT: As others have pointed out, Steinhoff engaged in accounting fraud, not money laundering. My bad.""2018: Bribery, Kickbacks, and Fraud:On Nov. 30, 2018, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported on a legal battle between Mattress Firm and former associates.Included in the story were allegations that all reportedly stemmed from the idea that real estate brokers and property development companies paid Mattress Firm insiders bribes and kickbacks for artificially inflating rental rates on leases throughout the country.Was it the breakneck growth alone that landed Mattress Firm Inc. in bankruptcy court? Or, as the company claims in a lawsuit filed last year, did a pair of greedy executives - taking advantage of the strategy to skim money off its real estate deals and enrich an outside accomplice - help it get there?...The company says in its suit it isn't entirely to blame: Two executives allegedly conspired with a real estate broker in a ""bribery, kickback, and fraud scheme"" to push the retailer into expensive locations - it declined to say how many - based on phony sales forecasts.According to the suit, Bruce Levy, the former head of real estate, and Ryan Vinson, a former vice president, let the broker, Alexander Deitch, oversee deals in a half-dozen states and ""front-run"" some of them, tipping him off to the next outlet's location so he could secretly buy it himself while reaping millions in fees.In return, Mattress Firm claims, Levy and Vinson got diamonds, a Roger Dubuis watch, European vacations, and stakes in other real estate deals. One Florida property allegedly came complete with a yacht.The three men deny the allegations in court papers and say they're being scapegoated by Mattress Firm.:More of the story can be read in the article from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. According to the Southeast Texas Record, the legal matters are ongoing.We reached out to Mattress Firm for comment, but they declined, saying: ""We are not able comment on specific details of this matter as litigation is still ongoing.""The Meme: Schererville and CEO ResignationThe Mattress Firm money laundering conspiracy theory meme in the TikTok video claimed: ""In Schererville, Indiana, there are 5 Mattress Firms within one mile of each other. Many believe that Mattress Firm is a money-laundering scheme, as they seem to appear everywhere but not have much demand. The CEO recently resigned after allegations of money laundering surfaced.""It's true that there were once five Mattress Firm stores within one mile of each other in that city. On Dec. 6, 2015, The Times of Northwest Indiana published the headline: ""Mattress Firm now has five stores less than a mile apart."" It reported that ""the ubiquitous Mattress Firm now has five stores in eight-tenths of a mile at the border of Schererville and Highland, and six within a 2.5-mile stretch along Indianapolis Boulevard."":The newspaper also noted that three of the Schererville locations were not originally opened as Mattress Firm stores. Rather, they were from company acquisitions of Back to Bed and Bedding Experts. Only two of the five locations remained in 2021.As for the CEO resignation mentioned in the meme, this appeared to refer to former Mattress Firm CEO Ken Murphy. The aforementioned conspiratorial Reddit comment was posted on Jan. 22, 2018.On Jan. 24, this company tweet appeared to make light of the virality of the comment. On the same day, Murphy told Business Insider that the money-laundering allegations were ""absolutely false.""Two days later on Jan. 26, Murphy announced his resignation.We asked Mattress Firm about Murphy's resignation and the fact that the company later filed for bankruptcy. A spokesperson explained::Mattress Firm declared bankruptcy in October 2018 in an effort to restructure its debt obligations, strengthen its balance sheet, and optimize store footprint. As part of the restructuring process, the company took the necessary steps to ensure we were well-positioned for the future, including optimizing our store fleet by closing 700 under-performing or duplicative locations.In the months leading up to bankruptcy and since emergence, there have been several leadership changes to provide fresh perspective and deep expertise in key areas that will be the foundation for the company's next phase of growth.Mattress Firm Stores in Close ProximityWe reached out to Mattress Firm's corporate headquarters to ask why consumers might sometimes see two or more Mattress Firm brick-and-mortar buildings somewhat near each other. A Mattress Firm spokesperson provided a lengthy response:We recognize that having stores in close proximity may seem unusual and it is true that sometimes it doesn't make financial sense, at least at first glance. The explanation of ""money laundering"" has somehow developed and, amusingly, become a cultural folklore over time. However, that is absolutely not the reason why we have so many stores.:Here are the facts - in the early 2000s, Mattress Firm set a goal to become the first border-to-border, coast-to-coast specialty mattress retailer. To achieve that goal, the company intentionally grew very quickly over a span of nine years through acquisitions and organic growth. As part of the acquisition of several competitors, sometimes with multiple acquisitions in a single market, we inherited existing, long-term leases for store locations. Many of these inherited lease locations happened to be near our existing store base. Once the stores were rebranded with Mattress Firm, a shopping center with two different competing mattress stores took on a new look.Since then, the company has been working diligently to rationalize our store fleet which is evidenced by the number of stores we've closed in recent years, but it's an ongoing process. We use a proprietary system, applying very specific data analyses and forecasted financial viability to help us determine optimal store placement, while also respecting business relationships with our landlords and our obligations under long-term lease agreements.We are committed to optimizing our footprint and ensuring we continue to provide our customers easy, convenient access to our products. Similar to coffee shops, fast food restaurants, and gas stations, our store placement is based on factors including population, income, and drive time. It's critical for us to invest in real estate in highly trafficked intersections and shopping centers in key markets to maintain visibility, so, in actuality, sometimes it does make financial sense to have stores in close proximity.:As for Schererville, the company spokesperson said: ""The two [remaining] locations in Indiana are in a shopping area that front an interstate and a highly traveled state route. This means they attract both local and regional customers. Depending on the consumer's traffic pattern, one store may be more visible and convenient than the other.""We asked the company if it could provide any financial records of the stores mentioned in the meme. The response: The company ""does not disclose financial information or performance data about individual stores,"" adding that ""the company continues to see positive growth and profitability in 2021.""Further Comment from Mattress FirmWe asked Mattress Firm if any investigative body has ever approached the company in regard to allegations of money laundering. ""Absolutely not,"" the spokesperson said.:""Along the way, someone decided that their theories on our business strategy were more exciting than the facts and shared their opinion on a community-based social media site. Despite swift refutation, the rumors have become a part of cultural folklore but have no correlation to the company's legitimate business.""We reached out to the FBI field office in Houston, Texas, where the company is headquartered, in order to confirm whether Mattress Firm has ever been investigated for any purported criminal activities. A spokesperson answered: ""Per DOJ policy, the FBI does not confirm or deny the existence of an investigation."""
247,247,112.DidDisneyAcquirePorn,"Claim:The Walt Disney Co. has acquired the pornographic video website Pornhub. Rating:Labeled SatireAbout this rating It's difficult to summarize the wide-ranging, ever-expanding, and practically nonsensical QAnon conspiracy theory. For the purposes of this article, readers should know that one of the main tenets of QAnon revolves around the claim that liberals, Hollywood celebrities, and various world leaders are involved in global pedophilia ring (a la Pizzagate).:With this in mind, it's perhaps not too surprising that supporters of this conspiracy theory were taken in by a satirical article claiming that the Walt Disney Co., a global organization known for its wholesome children's entertainment, had purchased the website Pornhub, which ... well, is known for distinctly adult content.On 17 May 2019, the Facebook page QAnon NC posted a link to an article from the satirical website The Beaverton under the caption: ""DID YOU KNOW #DISNEY OWNS #PORNHUB? Why is this not public knowledge? Disney executives pleased to announce acquisition of PornHub.""A number of other social media users posted about Disney's alleged acquisition of Pornhub, including several accounts that mentioned the QAnon conspiracy theory in their profiles::For the record, Disney has not purchased Pornhub.The article being shared on social media in May 2019 was originally published on the entertainment website The Beaverton in June 2018 and read as follows:""Expanding their media streaming portfolio, Disney executives announced that the company has acquired Canadian adult entertainment site, Pornhub ...""This is part of our plan to expand our streaming capabilities,"" said Dalton Sterling, VP of Market Strategy in a call to shareholders, adding that it will allow them to leverage existing properties like Star Wars, Marvel, and the original cartoon characters to create franchise specific content that were thus far left to fans to create. ""This is what the online world was made for, and it would be unfair to our shareholders to not get a part of the action."":This was not a genuine news article, as The Beaverton is a well-known entertainment site that publishes ""news satire and parody."" A disclaimer on the website reads as follows: ""The Beaverton is a news satire and parody publication. All articles contained within this website and on its social media accounts, however similar to real events, are fictitious. When public figures or actual businesses are mentioned by name, the corresponding story details are invented. In all other cases, any resemblance to actual persons, businesses or events is entirely coincidental.""Pornhub is actually owned by a company called Mindgeek. And while the Walt Disney Co. is truly a media empire that encompasses properties such as ESPN, Pixar, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm Ltd., ABC News, Hulu, and Twentieth Century Fox in its portfolio, that empire has yet to venture into field of pornographic videos."
248,248,692.DifferentDisasterSam,"The social media-borne hoaxes that now infamously spread online like diseases after major news events returned in force in the immediate aftermath of the 15 April 2019 fire that heavily damaged the iconic Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, France.Conspiracy theorists instantly attributed the fire to Islamic terrorists and compared the event to 9/11. Some shared audio recordings they falsely claimed captured Muslims shouting Islamic slogans at the scene. Others touted videos and images supposedly showing Muslims celebrating and laughing at the destruction of the cathedral. Still others asserted a nonexistent link between the Notre Dame fire and a foiled terrorist plot that actually took place in 2016.The hoaxes probably aren't going away any time soon, said David Carroll, associate professor of media design at the New School in New York City and a prominent critic of social media platforms. After mass casualty events in the past like the Las Vegas shooting and the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, tech companies such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google got bad press for letting hoaxes spread in their wakes. Although the technology giants have made efforts to improve, the Notre Dame fire showed it's not enough.:""It's the attention economy that is the economic motivation and incentive at the heart of this,"" Carroll told us. ""If we just think of [the platforms'] economic incentives, they were designed to maximize and monetize attention. Attention is the resource that is harvested and mined without any care for whether it is good or bad.""In a 16 April 2019 blog post, Twitter executives Donald Hicks and David Gasca said the platform was taking a more proactive approach toward addressing abusive content. However as Poynter reported, ""Twitter doesn't have a policy strictly aimed at decreasing the reach of false posts. Among the actions that the company does take is removing bogus accounts posing as news organizations. But that policy can be gamed -- and it isn't applied uniformly.""And conspiracy theories have a way of capturing people's attention. ""You can establish a good audience for yourself as a conspiracy theorist"" on social media platforms, Carroll added.Sometimes the hoax themes are explicitly racist, targeting certain groups. In the case of the Notre Dame fire, media gadflies pointed the finger at the Muslim community and claimed without evidence that the fire was an act of terror, even as French authorities announced the incident was likely the result of an accident and was not being investigated as arson.:""There is an actual terrorist that burned down three black churches in Louisiana. How many times have you seen his face and his name in the news?"" said Omar Suleiman, Islamic studies professor at Southern Methodist University and founder of the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research in Texas. ""But because the idea of Muslim terrorism is so prevalent, we get blamed now collectively for something that not even a single Muslim had anything to do with. This has reached a level of ridiculousness that is beyond guilt by association. It's just made up.""Authorities charged Holden Matthews, 21, on 15 April 2019 with hate crimes in relation to fires that destroyed three historically black churches in Louisiana over 10 days.Suleiman pointed to conspiratorial comments made by media personality Glenn Beck, who speculated on his radio show that, ""If this [fire] was started by Islamists, I don't think you'll find out about it"" and compared the event to the 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in New York.""A guy like [Glenn Beck] can associate Muslims with the cathedral burning and have no facts and no analysis behind it, yet it perpetuates the vicious cycle of keeping the Muslim community under a cloud of suspicion,"" Suleiman said. ""It's hard to disassociate this with what's happening with [U.S. Rep.] Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota). If even a Muslim congresswoman cannot be free from being associated with 9/11 by the president of the United States, then how can we expect more from bloggers who thrive on sensationalism and conspiracy?"":Suleiman was referring to a 12 April 2019 tweet posted by President Donald Trump that juxtaposed Omar, one of the first two Muslim women to serve in the U.S. Congress and the first to wear a hijab or religious head covering, with video footage of the 9/11 attacks. Omar received an increased number of death threats after Trump's tweet was posted.In March 2019, we asked Twitter about anti-Muslim hate speech on the platform following the mass shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand in which a white supremacist has been accused of killing 50 people in a shooting rampage at two mosques. Spokesman Ian Plunkett told us at that time that ""our policies do not allow hateful conduct and/or the extremism,"" but when we asked why, for example, known white supremacist David Duke still has an active account, we were told the company doesn't have any comment on individual cases.Hoaxes reflecting the baseless theme that the Notre Dame fire was the result of terrorism spread quickly. A Twitter user posted a video from the scene of the fire and falsely claimed that Muslims were shouting the Arabic phrase ""alahu akbar,"" which means ""God is great."" It's actually French authorities heard shouting ""allez en avant"" to bystanders, which roughly translates to get out of harm's way.:Are they yelling Allahu Akbar in Paris? pic.twitter.com/XxDzORrkUB-- Magaphobia (@MAGAphobia) April 15, 2019In another video that accompanied a now-deleted tweet, audio of people shouting ""alahu akbar"" was superimposed on video footage of the cathedral burning to again give the misleading impression that Muslim people were celebrating the fire. As NBC News pointed out, ""The audio comes from a years-old video, which is the first result when a user searches for 'Allahu Akbar Scream' in Google.:Anti-Muslim blogger Pamela Geller also perpetuated baseless claims that Muslim people were celebrating in the fire's aftermath. Geller shared a post purporting to show that people with ""Arab [Muslim] names"" reacted to the event with smiling or laughing emoticons on Facebook.But as BuzzFeed News pointed out, trying to lay culpability at the feet of the Muslim community using Facebook reactions is both facile and unverifiable. ""During the Notre Dame fire the laughing face emojis were clearly in the minority and it's impossible to know why people chose a specific emoji, or for that matter the religion of people reacting to a Facebook video. It's also difficult to verify the authenticity of the accounts. Bottom line: Facebook emojis on a video do not tell us anything about a group of people.""That same post from Geller also featured an image of two smiling men ducking under police tape with the burning cathedral in the background, claiming without evidence they were ""jihadists"" celebrating the destruction.A number of Twitter accounts shared a 2016 story about a foiled terror plot that involved a car carrying gas canisters that was parked near the cathedral, giving the false impression that the incident happened in the days leading to the fire.:Not surprised. I already thought it was Islamic terrorism. ?Gas tanks and Arabic documents found in unmarked car by Paris' Notre-Dame cathedral spark terror fears' | via @telegraph https://t.co/Vus9a7c5rY-- SHERI ?? (@Sheri_Hischild) April 17, 2019In yet another instance, conspiracy mongers claimed that a firefighter seen on camera was a nefarious, robed person.Nothing to see here. Just a dude. In a robe. Wandering about alone, whilst firefighters tackle the blaze. #NotreDame https://t.co/07orTScdn9-- Katie Hopkins (@KTHopkins) April 16, 2019In one of the most high-profile social media platform snafus, people watching livestreamed footage of the Notre Dame fire on YouTube were mistakenly fed background information for the 9/11 terror attacks by YouTube's algorithm. As The Associated Press reported, ""The background note was posted by a system YouTube recently put in place to combat well-known conspiracies about such events as the moon landing or 9/11. In this case, the algorithm might have had the opposite effect, fueling speculation about the cause of the fire and who might be behind it."":Why in the world is @YouTube putting information about 9/11 underneath the Notre Dame livestream from @FRANCE24?(Especially since it seems like, at least right now, ongoing renovations are the most likely cause, no indication of terror) https://t.co/A3HP36epxx pic.twitter.com/ZheCMC5pcG-- Joshua Benton (@jbenton) April 15, 2019Carroll concurred: ""It seems like a better technical solution could have been that as the breaking news event is occurring, to remind people about simple rules, like wait for authorities to provide verified reports and be aware that conspiracy theories are going to happen, don't fall for them when they do,"" he said. ""They tried to automatically correct [the problem] which ended up making things worse because the algorithm misfired.""Carroll said he's optimistic that the looming presidential campaign will kick up these issues in a high-profile political environment. Debates need to happen, he said, around what the platforms are responsible for doing, how best to address the issue, and what types of regulations could resolve some of the problems.:""Some of it comes down to the fact that [the platforms] don't employ humans to do what reporters do, meaning it doesn't seem to me that there are people employed at these companies that sit on the platforms and look for threat models and proactively deal with them accordingly,"" Carroll told us. ""It's all being outsourced. Where is the in-house defense layer? Doesn't seem to be there.""YouTube (which is owned by Google) said in a statement to The New York Times that, ""These [fact checking] panels are triggered algorithmically and our systems sometimes make the wrong call."" The panels, as the Times reported, were announced in summer 2018, ""as part of a broader effort to root out misinformation"" and would appear ""alongside videos on a small number of well-established historical and scientific topics that have often been subject to misinformation, like the moon landing and the Oklahoma City Bombing.""For Suleiman, who in March 2019 traveled to Christchurch to help bury mosque shooting victims, the issue is both pressing and a matter of public safety. He has seen first hand the effects of hateful online rhetoric.:""You cannot see this issue disconnected from the elements around it,"" he told us. ""We're coming off the brink of the worst terrorist attack against a Muslim minority in the West, and also the president is inciting his followers against one of our first two Muslim women in Congress and connecting them to terrorists."""
249,249,131.NoBaalEnciAgaDoesntM,"Claim:""Balenciaga"" is Latin for ""Baal is king.""Rating:FalseAbout this rating Luxury fashion brand Balenciaga has been the focus of outrage and conspiracy theories due to a backlash over ads published in November 2022 showing child models holding bags shaped like teddy bears outfitted in bondage gear. The bags were part of Balenciaga's spring 2023 collection and were featured in Paris Fashion Week, albeit carried by grown models.:The controversy drove anger over the placement of young children alongside a teddy bear-shaped bag dressed in kink garb and spawned conspiracy theories that were primed by years of Qanon-style discourse. As we have previously reported, the Qanon conspiracy theory posits that a cabal of elites, namely prominent Democratic figures and celebrities, are involved in a satanic child sex trafficking ring.The conspiracy theory in question appears in various TikTok videos viewed millions of times as of this writing, in which the TikTok videographers zoom in on a Balenciaga ad showing a child dressed in black. On the floor in the left foreground is a role of yellow tape that appears to have a misspelling, with two ""A's"" instead of one, meaning Balenciaga was spelled, presumably intentionally, ""Baalenciaga."" :Some connected the dots from Balenciaga to Baal, an ancient Canaanite god of fertility. A widely-viewed Instagram post by Robby Starbuck, who made an attempt to be the Republican candidate to represent Tennessee's 5th congressional district in an August 2022 primary, claimed the following.""Go do Google translate from Latin to English. I did it myself. The depths of evil surrounding the Balenciaga story just get deeper and darker at every turn,"" Starbuck wrote on Instagram.Here's the full post::It's true that if you go to Google Translate and select ""Latin"" as the language of the phrase you want to translate, then type in ""Baal enci aga,"" it spits out ""Baal is the King"" as the English translation. As of this writing, we don't know why that is, because ""Baal enci aga"" isn't a Latin phrase. Dinosaur enthusiasts might remember that the Latin word for king is ""rex"" (as in Tyrannosaurus rex). We reached out to Google asking how such a fluke might occur, and will report back if and when we receive an answer.We experimented with variations of the ""Latin"" phrase on Google Translate and came up with similarly weird results. (Google Translate):The name of the brand, ""Balenciaga,"" doesn't have anything to do with Baal or the occult. It is the surname of the founder of the fashion brand. Cristobal Balenciaga was a Spaniard of humble beginnings who began designing dresses to help his mother financially after the premature death of his father. He went on to found the fashion house in the early 20th Century in San Sebastian, Spain -- well before the current controversy ensued. One final note. Just for kicks, we plugged ""Snopes enci aga"" into Google's Latin-to-English translator. This -- and we are not making this up -- was the result: : "

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.With prospects of a COVID-19 vaccine looking up, attention is also turning to the problem of anti-vax ideas. According to a recent survey, one in six Britons would refuse a COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available. Although vaccine hesitancy is a complex problem with multiple causes, the number of conspiracy theories circulating about the coronavirus do not help.The fight against COVID-19-related conspiracy theories will be fought on multiple fronts. It requires a broad public health campaign and for social-media companies to control the spread of disinformation. But all of us can play a part in this effort. Most people will know someone who has succumbed to conspiracy theories about the current crisis.I have been researching conspiracy theories for over two decades and have spoken to many believers. Here are the six rules I use for talking to conspiracy theorists in the effort to change their mind. :1. Acknowledge scale of the taskTalking to people who endorse conspiracy theories is inherently difficult. Simply laying out evidence or pointing out logical contradictions in the conspiracist argument is seldom enough. Conspiracy theories are, by definition, irrefutable. Lack of evidence of a conspiracy, or positive proof against its existence, is taken by believers as evidence of the craftiness of those behind the plot, and their ability to dupe the public. So arm yourself with patience, and be prepared to fail.2. Recognise the emotional dimensionConspiracy theories seduce not so much through the power of argument, but through the intensity of the passions that they stir. Underpinning conspiracy theories are feelings of resentment, indignation and disenchantment about the world. They are stories about good and evil, as much as about what is true. :This gives conspiracy theories a strong emotional dimension. Tempers can flare and conversations turn into a shouting match. It is important to prevent this from happening. Be prepared to de-escalate the situation and keep the dialogue going, without necessarily giving ground. 3. Find out what they actually believeBefore trying to persuade someone, find out the nature and content of their beliefs. When it comes to conspiracy theories, the world is not divided into ""believers"" and ""skeptics"" - there's a lot in between. A minority of committed believers treat conspiracy theories as the literal truth and are particularly resistant to persuasion. Many others might not see themselves as ""believers"", but are willing to accept that conspiracy theorists might be onto something and are at least asking the right questions. Establishing the precise nature, and extent, of someone's belief, will enable you to better tailor your response.:5G antenna has nothing to do with coronavirus.Shutterstock.comAlso, try and find out what specific conspiracy theory they endorse. Is it 5G or Bill Gates that they think is behind coronavirus? Or both? What videos or websites have they looked at? Once you find out, gather as much disconfirming evidence as you can from credible sources, including multiple independent fact-checking websites. Background research will help you to focus the discussion on the substance of the claims. Never question someone's intelligence or moral sense, as this is the quickest way to end a conversation.4. Establish common groundOne of the main problems with conspiracy theories is that they are not confined to tinfoil-hat-wearing kooks or political extremists. In times of crisis and uncertainty, they can contaminate the worldview of otherwise reasonable people. :Conspiracy theories make reality seem less chaotic, and tap into broader, often well-grounded concerns about the world such as the concentration of financial and political power, mass surveillance, inequality or lack of political transparency. So when talking about conspiracy theories, start by acknowledging these broader concerns and restrict your discussion to whether conspiracy theories can provide an adequate or meaningful answer.Many people come to conspiracy theories through genuine, albeit misguided, curiosity about how to make sense of the world. They sometimes see themselves as healthy skeptics and self-taught researchers into complex issues. Avoid criticising or mocking this. Instead, present it as something that, in principle, you value and share. Your aim, after all, is not to make them less curious or skeptical, but to change what they are curious about, or skeptical of.Most conspiracy theorists don't look like this.ShutterstockConspiracy theories often sound convincing because they start with the detailed exposition of credible scientific or historical facts. The problem is that these facts and arguments lead to extraordinary conclusions. :The kernels of truth on which conspiracy theories are based are a solid starting point for a discussion. Agreement on at least some of the facts will allow you to focus on the leap of imagination that allows two and two to make five.5. Challenge the facts, value their argumentDebunking conspiracy theories requires a two-pronged approach. The first involves challenging evidence and its origins. Address specific claims and discuss what constitutes a credible source. Offer to look at the evidence together, including on fact-checking websites. If you are talking to a staunch believer, they probably won't even engage with you on this. But if they have not yet fallen down the rabbit hole, they might, and this may lead them to start questioning their views.The second approach involves challenging the relevance and value of the conspiracist case more generally. You may want to point out that throughout history, conspiracy theories have come up short. :For instance, the longstanding claims by AIDS denialists that antiretroviral drugs are more harmful than HIV were not only disproven, but they contributed to hundreds of thousands of deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. More recent and similarly baseless theories about the polio vaccine causing sterility directly led to the disease resurging in Nigeria, Pakistan and Afganistan. COVID-19-related claims are in the same genre. Setting these conspiracy theories in their historical context can demonstrate that they offer nothing new, and don't ask the right questions about the pandemic and its causes. This just might encourage the person to direct their curiosity and skepticism to more worthwhile concerns.6. Finally, be realisticThere is, of course, no guarantee that this advice will be effective. There are no incontestable arguments or fail-proof strategies that will always convert a conspiracy theorist to skepticism. Therefore, set realistic expectations. The aim of talking to conspiracy theorists is not to convert them, but to sow doubt about an argument, and hopefully enable them to gradually build up resistance to its seductive appeal.:Jovan Byford, Senior Lecturer in Psychology, The Open UniversityThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

251,251,42.NoJeffreyDavidCoxWas,"Claim:Union leader Jeffrey David Cox played a key role in an alleged Clinton-orchestrated conspiracy to kill Jeffrey Epstein in prison.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In late 2019, we received multiple inquiries about a conspiracy theory that tied Jeffrey David Cox, a union leader, to the death of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.On Nov. 22, for example, a Facebook user posted a photograph of Cox, who is president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), shaking hands with former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The photograph was accompanied by the following caption::""Jeffrey David Cox (in Google, real name just David Cox) is the head of Federal Prison Guards in Manhattan. Jeffery is the boss of the guards who were supposed to keep Jeffery Epstein alive while in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. He also is friends with Bill and Hillary Clinton. This is such a small world..."":Another widely shared meme featured a screenshot of a post that included photographs of Clinton and Cox shaking hands and the following text:""Just another coinky dink connection to the famous couple. Say hello to Jeffrey David Cox the head of Federal Prison Guards in Manhattan. Jeffery [sic] is the boss of the guards who were supposed to keep Jeffery [sic] Epstein alive while in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. He also is friends with Bill and Hillary Clinton. You cant [sic] make this stuff up."":Former President Bill Clinton was an acquaintance of Epstein and has acknowledged having visited his home and traveled on his private plane on several occasions. However, no evidence has emerged showing that Clinton had any knowledge of Epstein's sexual offenses during that time. Epstein died in prison in New York in August while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. An initial autopsy ruled his death a suicide by hanging, but some experts have said the specific injuries he suffered were more commonly associated with homicide by strangulation, rather than suicide by hanging.Both the FBI and the Justice Department's Inspector General were conducting investigations into Epstein's death as of Dec. 4, 2019. In November, two prison guards at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan were charged with falsifying records associated with their oversight of Epstein's cell on the night of his death.  Many claims and theories surrounded Epstein, before and since his death. Among them was speculation that the billionaire, who was convicted of child prostitution charges in Florida in 2008, may have acquired compromising evidence about purported sexual wrongdoing on the part of certain influential public figures, and that he might have provided prosecutors evidence or testimony about others in exchange for more lenient punishment in his own pending sex trafficking case. :In August 2019, President Donald Trump (who was himself an acquaintance of Epstein) shared a tweet that promoted the unfounded conspiracy theory that Epstein was killed at the behest of the Clintons because he ""had information on Bill Clinton."" The memes about Cox in November and December 2019 were a further twist on the baseless conspiracy theory that the Clintons were responsible for the death of Epstein, as a means of preventing him from sharing damaging information or evidence about Bill Clinton, and even the premises of the Cox theory were factually flawed. AnalysisCox is president of the AFGE, a national union of federal government employees. His role is not specific to federal prison employees. Contrary to claims made in the memes, he is not ""the head of federal prison guards in Manhattan"" or ""the boss of the guards who were supposed to keep Epstein alive."" The warden of the Metropolitan Correctional Center at the time of Epstein's death was Lamine N'Diaye. Union leaders like Cox are not employers or supervisors, and their role is to lobby on behalf of their members on a collective basis, not to micromanage the work of individuals, or to provide them instructions.:The website WhatDoesItMean.com -- a notorious serial producer of anonymously sourced conspiracy theories and sensational predictions that never come to pass -- described Cox and another AFGE official, Serene Gregg, as being personally in control of ""the hiring and scheduling of prison guards.""This is a ludicrous assertion, akin to claiming that the president of the National Education Association is personally in charge of hiring teachers at public schools throughout the country, as well as organizing their recess duty schedules. WhatDoesItMean.com was also responsible for the baseless claims that the Clintons had gifted Cox and Gregg multi-million dollar homes in China, as part of what the website described as an ""international murder for hire hit contract"" against Epstein. Cox appears to have been chosen as the focus of the conspiracy theory not due to any part in an actual conspiracy, but because of his extremely tenuous, aforementioned link to the guards in charge of Epstein's cell (they were federal employees and he is the national president of a federal employees union) and because he has been photographed in public with Hillary Clinton. :The photograph shown in the memes was authentic, but it had a mundane explanation. In November 2015, Hillary Clinton and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders both took part in an AFGE forum. Labor unions form a key component of the Democratic party's base, so it was unremarkable that the two leading Democratic primary candidates should meet with officials from the country's biggest federal employees union during the course of the presidential primaries.Since Cox was president of the union and appears to have chaired the forum, it was also entirely normal for Clinton to pose for photographs with him, which she did, as can be seen on the AFGE's Flickr profile. According to Vox.com, Cox was an unpledged ""superdelegate"" at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, and he publicly supported her nomination. Cox might be ""friends with Bill and Hillary Clinton,"" as one of the memes claimed, but we found no publicly available evidence that he has a relationship with either Clinton that goes beyond the cordial dynamic that one would expect between a leading national labor union official and two historically powerful figures within the Democratic party.:Thus, the Cox-Clinton conspiracy theory is both without any specific factual basis, but it is also based on erroneous premises -- that Cox is so close and so fiercely loyal a friend to the Clintons that he would organize a murder on their behalf, and that Cox, despite being a Washington D.C.-based official in a federal employees union, personally oversaw the hiring and scheduling of specific prison guards at one particular federal correctional facility in New York.

252,252,234.DidWSJOpEdbyBidenin9,"Claim:In an April 1992 Wall Street Journal op-ed by then-U.S. Sen. Joe Biden, titled ""How I Learned to Love the New World Order,"" he argued for a ""one world government"" and to destroy individual national sovereignty. Rating:FalseAbout this rating ContextWhile the Wall Street Journal did publish an op-ed essay by Biden titled, ""How I Learned to Love the New World Order,"" he did not argue for destroying national sovereignty, but rather to ""breathe life into the U.N. charter"" that promoted multilateral action. The article argues against America's role as a ""globocop"" that resorts to military intervention, and calls for greater economic strength and robust diplomacy. :As the Taliban took over Afghanistan, U.S. President Joe Biden pulled American troops out in August 2021, with the last military plane departing at the end of the month, marking the end of a two-decade-long presence in the country. Biden has faced plenty of criticism for the rushed departure particularly from right-wing voices, and the internet pulled out an old article he wrote for The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), titled ""How I Learned to Love the New World Order,"" to bolster arguments against him. According to numerous posts like this one, the essay was arguing for the destruction of ""national sovereignty"" and the establishment of ""a one world government."" Some claimed that because of the headline, Biden supported a ""New World Order,"" which advocates for ""one world government."" This stems from the New World Order (NWO) conspiracy theory, which claims that a secret group of global elites is seeking to establish an all-powerful, authoritarian, one-world government. :The essay was indeed published by The Wall Street Journal on April 23, 1992. We found a copy in the archives of the New York Public Library. The full version can be seen below::Biden wrote the essay in response to a Wall Street Journal editorial that claimed he was in favor of ""neo-isolationism."" To be clear, in Biden's essay, he was not talking about the NWO conspiracy theory. He argued that the Pentagon's strategy of making America a ""Globocop"" would render it a ""hollow superpower."" The highlights made in the blog post above about his essay do not support the argument that Biden wants to ""destroy national sovereignty."" In the article Biden argues for Americans to pull back on military intervention and build up economic might: ""Bristling with weapons, we would continue our economic decline, while rising industrial and financial giants in Europe and Asia viewed our military pretensions with indifference or contempt.""The essay also addresses America's role as a ""Globocop,"" arguing that ""Power also emanates from [...] the economic leverage to wield diplomatic clout,"" and not from ""the barrel of a gun."" Biden argues in favor of multilateral military action by breathing ""life into the U.N. Charter."" He envisions ""a permanent commitment of forces, for use by the Security Council. That means a presumption of collective action -- but with a U.S. veto."":He concluded: ""We must get lean militarily, revitalize American economic strength, and exercise a diplomatic leadership that puts new muscle into institutions of collective security."" The blog post makes another claim: that Biden wrote the WSJ article many years before writing the Patriot Act, a counterterrorism bill that increased surveillance capabilities by U.S. law enforcement after 9/11. This is partially true, because Biden did support the Patriot Act and claimed he was responsible for authoring earlier versions of counterterrorism legislation that featured prominently in it. Biden introduced and authored the Omnibus Counterterrorism Act of 1995, which he argued provided one source of inspiration for the 2001 Patriot Act.  In October 2001, he said in a Senate speech supporting the Patriot Act: ""It allows law enforcement to keep up with the modern technology these terrorists are using. The bill contains several provisions which are identical or nearly identical to those I previously proposed."" The Patriot Act was criticized by civil rights advocates and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) who said it turned regular citizens into suspects, and resulted in a loss of privacy. While civil rights experts have criticized his support for the law, that criticism does not suggest that Biden is trying to build a ""one world government."" :While the WSJ did publish this essay by Biden, the article did not make the arguments that critical blog posts on social media are claiming. As such, we rate this claim as ""False.""Sources:""Afghanistan: Last US Military Flight Departs Ending America's Longest War.""

253,253,676.NoAdamSchiffWasntArr,"Claim:U.S. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff was arrested at LAX on Christmas Eve 2020.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In late December 2020, readers searched the Snopes website with a query: Was U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, arrested at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) while traveling home for the winter holidays?The answer is no, Schiff wasn't arrested. But that didn't stop trolls from spending Christmas and the days after busily posting it on social media. For example, many shared a screenshot of a message posted to a QAnon conspiracy message board::Schiff, who chairs the U.S. House Intelligence Committee, spearheaded congressional investigations into allegations of wrongdoing by U.S. President Donald Trump, leading to the impeachment of Trump by the House of Representatives. Schiff has thus long been a favorite target of internet troll hoaxes and conspiracy theories.The claim that Schiff was arrested appears to have originated from a Twitter account with the handle ""MelaniasRhonda,"" which has since been suspended by Twitter. The legal news site Law & Crime, however, captured screenshots of comments posted to the account before it was suspended. The user falsely claimed to have seen Schiff taken into custody at LAX on Christmas Eve.:Many accounts shared a screenshot allegedly from a website called LACountyArrrestRecords.org, which contains a disclaimer that it isn't an ""official source of information."" The website requires a monthly paid subscription to access information posted on it.To be clear, Schiff's name doesn't show up in the official sources of arrest information in Los Angeles -- the L.A. County Sheriff's Department inmate locator or the Federal Bureau of Prisons inmate locator. Additionally, we note that if a U.S. congressman, particularly one of Schiff's stature, had been arrested, there would doubtlessly be mainstream news coverage, and there are no credible news reports or any other evidence of any such arrest."
254,254,441.DidCDCQuietlyUpdateC,"Claim:The CDC ""quietly updated"" its COVID-19 mortality statistics in summer 2020 to show only 6% of previously reported deaths were actually due to the coronavirus, while the remaining 94% died from preexisting health conditions. Rating:FalseAbout this rating Snopes is still fighting an ""infodemic"" of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help. Find out what we've learned and how to inoculate yourself against COVID-19 misinformation. Read the latest fact checks about the vaccines. Submit any questionable rumors and ""advice"" you encounter. Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. :In attempt to ring the alarm on supposed deceptive practices by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), hard-line conservatives including U.S. President Donald Trump promoted the idea in August 2020 that the public health agency suddenly changed its methods for reporting COVID-19 mortality statistics.And as a result, viral social media posts alleged, America only tallied about 9,000 COVID-19 fatalities, or roughly 6% of the more than 150,000 deaths widely reported by politicians, scientists, and news reporters.Many believers, including conspiracy theorist Jeff Berwick, dubbed the alleged change by the CDC evidence that people other than his followers were exaggerating the seriousness of the pandemic, and that everyone should be skeptical of rules on social distancing that halt the economy. In a Sept. 1 video, for example, he said: ""It's been proven by the CDC -- [the pandemic] is nothing, it was absolutely nothing. Zero. 9,000 people? That's nothing."":Numerous readers asked Snopes to investigate the matter. Several inquiries included a link to the hyperpartisan, junk news website The Gateway Pundit, or a link to another conspiratorial web page that phrased the alleged revelation like this:""The CDC quietly released new covid numbers showing those who solely died from the virus was only 6% (9,210) of the total deaths (153,504). 94% of those who died, did so because they had existing health conditions.""Additionally, The Gateway Pundit page claimed, ""the overwhelming majority"" of reported COVID-19 deaths were among ""very old Americans"" -- without going into specifics on what age population that meant -- and suggested nefarious intentions on the part of the CDC to try to change its guidance without anyone noticing.Versions of this notion circulated widely online in summer 2020, in part because of support from American politicians such as Trump. In two retweets -- one by his campaign adviser that linked to the Gateway Pundit page and another by a supporter of the unfounded QAnon conspiracy theory (screenshot below) -- Trump endorsed the claim, essentially denigrating scientific evidence by his own health advisers, Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx. However, as of this writing, Twitter had removed the below-displayed post for violating its terms of service.::First, to unpack the claim, let's be clear about how COVID-19 -- which is the disease caused by the coronavirus dubbed SARS-CoV-2 -- attacks the body and can become deadly. According to an article in the journal Science, a highly credible scientific publication:Once inside, the virus hijacks the cell's machinery, making myriad copies of itself and invading new cells. As the virus multiplies, an infected person may shed copious amounts of it, especially during the first week or so. Symptoms may be absent at this point. Or the virus' new victim may develop a fever, dry cough, sore throat, loss of smell and taste, or head and body aches.If the immune system doesn't beat back SARS-CoV-2 during this initial phase, the virus then marches down the windpipe to attack the lungs, where it can turn deadly.In other words, SARS-CoV-2 attacks lung cells, and that assault on a person's respiratory system can greatly exacerbate other preexisting conditions. That means COVID-19 patients run the risk of previously manageable health problems turning fatal -- including cardiac arrest, liver failure, or lung scarring -- after they're infected with SARS-CoV-2. Put another way, Ryan McNamara, a virologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in a series of tweets compared the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS. He wrote::After years of (HIV) virus spread, and in the absence of treatment, a patient infected with HIV will develop AIDS. [...] During this state of HIV progression, white blood cells called T-cells are depleted. This can allow co-infecting pathogens to spread unchecked or tumor cells to grow & metastasize. Hence pneumonia & AIDS-associated cancers are leading causes of death in HIV+ patients. :Next, we investigated how the CDC compiles COVID-19 death toll data. Since the viral posts did not specify what ""numbers"" by the CDC to which they were alleging nefariousness, we considered the CDC's Provisional Death Counts for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) web page, which is a compilation of death certificates updated weekly by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).Additionally, we obtained an April 2020 document by the World Health Organization titled, ""International Guidelines For Certification and Classification (Coding) of COVID-19 As Cause of Death,"" which stated that medical examiners must include as much detail as possible based on records and lab testing when they're filling out death certificates. For example, a death certification for a patient who was infected with SARS-CoV-2 and afterwards developed pneumonia and fatal respiratory distress would list all three conditions as causes of death (see example below).:The document also said death certificates for people who suffered from chronic conditions, such as coronary artery disease or diabetes, before their exposure to the coronavirus would list those conditions in addition to COVID-19. The coronavirus would still be labeled the underlying cause of death -- or the disease that ""initiated the train of events leading directly to death,"" per the WHO's definition -- since the preexisting health issues were likely exacerbated by the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection.Next, we considered the CDC's process for analyzing those death certificates that list COVID-19. Its website explained:When a person dies, the cause of death is determined by the certifier -- the physician, medical examiner, or coroner who reports it on the death certificate. States register all death certificates and send them to [NCHS], where they are used to produce the nation's official death statistics. [...]When COVID-19 is reported as a cause of death on the death certificate, it is coded and counted as a death due to COVID-19. COVID-19 should not be reported on the death certificate if it did not cause or contribute to the death. [...]Complete means describing a clear chain of events from the immediate to the underlying cause of death, reporting any other conditions that contributed to death, and providing information that is specific.:In short, the CDC compiles mortality statistics that are based on all possible causes of death for one individual. So if a diabetes patient with high blood pressure was infected with COVID-19 -- which can target blood vessels -- and they die because their blood vessels were already so damaged, the CDC would consider their death related to both the coronavirus and diabetes. (According to the CDC database of death certificate data, that was the case for more than 27,500 people.)As of this writing, the CDC last updated its mortality statistics on Sept. 3, 2020. At that point, the agency said 171,787 death certificates included COVID-19 since the beginning of the U.S. outbreak in February 2020. And alongside the coronavirus, the majority of documents also listed comorbidities, or additional health issues that can either worsen or develop after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. For instance, 71,700 included influenza or pneumonia and COVID-19 as potential causes of death.However, fueling the conspiracy theory, the CDC web page stated::""For 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause [of death] mentioned. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 2.6 additional conditions or causes per death.""That meant, yes, medical investigators believed only 6% of COVID-19 patients died from the coronavirus alone. Those patients had no reported comorbidities. However, it was dangerously wrong to misinterpret that fact to mean that the remaining fatalities (or 94 percent) died from health issues other than the coronavirus. Rather, most people's underlying cause of death was COVID-19 and the virus either intensified or caused other illnesses that contributed to patients' death.Note: The ""6%"" claim was not the first attempt by COVID-19 conspiracy theorists to allege without any substantial evidence that the CDC was nefariously compiling data to trick people into thinking the coronavirus was more serious than it actually is. In spring 2020, for instance, they attempted to ring the alarm on the agency supposedly inflating COVID-19 death numbers for political reasons, but in reality the alleged discrepancy was a result of comparing two separate data sources that report different measurements. (See our analysis into that claim here.):The death certification statistics, in short, prove that people with preexisting health problems -- such as asthma or hypertension -- face higher risk for serious illness, or dying, if they're infected with COVID-19, according to Bob Anderson, lead mortality statistician at NCHS. He said in a statement to NBC News: ""These data are consistent with CDC guidance that those with underlying medical conditions are at greater risk for severe illness and death from COVID-19.""Additionally, Fauci explained the phenomena in a Sept. 1 interview on the ABC program ""Good Morning America:The point that the CDC was trying to make was that a certain percentage of [COVID-19 deaths] had nothing else but just COVID. That does not mean that someone who has hypertension or diabetes who dies of COVID didn't die of COVID-19 -- they did. So the numbers that you've been hearing -- the 180,000-plus deaths -- are real deaths from COVID-19. ...It's not 9,000 deaths from COVID-19.Next, we found data to address another aspect of the fringe theory: that the ""overwhelming majority"" of reported COVID-19 deaths were among people of a ""very advanced age."" For the purpose of this report, we considered that group to be people aged 85 or older. And according to the CDC death certificate data, 53,000 documents for that population listed COVID-19 as a potential cause of death, accounting for about one-third of the total, or less than the majority.:We should note here: Epidemiologists and health officials have been up front with the fact that COVID-19 patients who are older -- as well as those who have underlying health problems -- are at greater risk for serious problems.""As you get older, your risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19 increases. Everyone, especially older adults and others at increased risk of severe illness, should take steps to protect themselves from getting COVID-19,"" according to the CDC. Eight out of 10 people who have died as a result of COVID-19 in the U.S. were over the age of 65, per the agency's data.Lastly, we looked for any evidence to confirm or deny that the CDC attempted to ""quietly"" adjust its mortality statistics under the public's radar. Bob Anderson, lead mortality statistician at NCHS, told NBC News in a statement the death certificate data does ""not represent new information as NCHS has been publishing this same information since the outset when we began posting data on COVID-19 deaths on our web site."" In sum, considering the way in which the coronavirus impacts the human body, the way the CDC compiles data from death certificates -- listing comorbidities that were either developed or exacerbated by COVID-19  -- as well as the fact that one-third of COVID-19 fatalities were people aged 85 or older, we rate this claim ""False."":"
255,255,202.UpstateNewYorkMurder,"Claim:The deaths of John Beilman and his daughter were linked to the Las Vegas mass shooting via a device found in Stephen Paddock's hotel room.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In the aftermath of a deadly mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas in October 2017, conspiracy theorists latched on to an entirely unrelated tragedy in upstate New York, falsely claiming a link between a murder-suicide perpetrated in Fairport, New York, and the actions of the Las Vegas shooter::A key witness in the Las Vegas shooting massacre has killed himself and his disabled daughter in a horrific murder-suicide shortly after the FBI raided his home. John Beilman was wanted for questioning by federal agents in connection with a communications device discovered in suspected shooter Stephen Paddock's hotel room.Articles explicating this conspiracy theory contained many details and factual claims that were not supported by any real evidence, and even cited evidence that, in reality, comprehensively disproved any ""link"" between the deaths of John Beilman and his daughter and the Las Vegas shooting massacre. Here is what we know to be true: On 4 October 2017, police in the town of Fairport, New York (about 10 miles from Rochester) confirmed that 60-year-old John Beilman had shot and killed his 27-year-old daughter Nicole before shooting and killing himself. Beilman left a note for his wife, but the motive behind the shooting is not known. Police confirmed that Nicole Beilman was diagnosed with Rett Syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that can severely impair an individuals ability to speak, walk, eat and breathe. :Two days later, the Rochester newspaper Democrat and Chronicle, citing anonymous sources, reported that Federal Bureau of Investigation agents had searched the Beilman home on 3 October 2017, the day before the shooting. That article does not provide any specifics as to the reason for the purported search. Claims that Beilman's actions have anything to do with the Las Vegas massacre rest on the following ""evidence"":Investigators found in the Las Vegas shooter's hotel room a charger that doesn't match any of his phones.This claim is inaccurate, and was known to be inaccurate at the time both articles were written. On 6 October 2017, NBC News reported that investigators, after earlier being puzzled by the presence of the phone charger, ""have now been able to match all of the cell phone chargers found in the room with multiple cell phones that Paddock had with him."":The device charges a particular type of batteryWithout providing any evidence, both articles claim that S.V.R. (Russian intelligence) sources had identified the device as charging a ""CP502520 3.0V 600mAh Li-MnO2 Non-rechargeable Thin Cell Battery."" Setting aside the fact that there is no evidence to support this claim, we know it to be impossible. The battery specified is non-rechargeable -- there is no charger that is compatible with it, so the charger found in the Las Vegas shooter's hotel room cannot be associated with it. The entire conspiracy theory falls down around this point alone, but let's briefly address some of its other components. That battery is used by United States Special Forces and the CIA.Even if the charger could work with the type of battery specified (it cannot) we know that this battery is used ""in both professional & consumer applications,"" according to its manufacturer, Ultralife Corporation. There is nothing particularly notable about its use, or the use of the (imaginary) charger associated with it. Some of the common applications listed include: smart security cards, bank theft tracking systems, and medical devices. None of these are exclusive to U.S. special forces or the CIA. :John Beilman worked for Ultralife from 2007 to 2012 as a ""product design and manufacturing professional""This appears to be accurate. Beilman's public LinkedIn profile lists him as an employee of Ultralife from 2007 to 2012 and mentions that he performed ""electromechanical assembly"" of lithium ion batteries, chargers, and other devices.Whereas conspiracy theorists posited that Beilman ""worked on various top-secret communications systems for the US military,"" there is no evidence to support this claim. Given that police have paired the charger found in Stephen Paddock's hotel room with one of his phones, and the battery at the center of this conspiracy theory cannot be charged anyway, John Beilman's work history is, of course, irrelevant.Beilman was a ""key witness"" in the Las Vegas investigation and was ""wanted for questioning"" by the FBI before his death.There was no evidence to support these claims. :It appears that the creators of this theory started with the fact of John Beilman and his daughter's death, and worked backwards, via his professional history, in an effort to find some way of connecting him with the Las Vegas shooting. There is no valid connection, and the evidence offered actually refutes the entire theory.In fact, this tale was yet another fabrication that originated with the conspiracy-mongering WhatDoesItMean fake news site, which RationalWiki describes as follows:""Sorcha Faal"" is the alleged author of an ongoing series of ""reports"" published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don't think much of it. There is a high chance that ""Sorcha Faal"" is actually David Booth, the owner/operator of the website, or someone collaborating with him.The primary audience of Sorcha Faal's reports and the only ones who take them seriously are usually other conspiracy theorists.Each report resembles a news story in its style, but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality (e.g. ""American Rebel Forces Attack Gas Pipelines, Explode Trains As US Civil War Nears""[8]) and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service in the same article) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don't contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish. Cited sources range from the mainstream media and Wikipedia to Infowars and Richard Hoagland. The author also has the habit of adding unnecessary links to the websites of the various Russian institutions they mention.:Nonetheless, the WhatDoesItMean.com fabrication gained enough currency online that the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle felt a need to debunk it as well:If you get your local news from the Democrat and Chronicle or television news stations in town, there's a lot you haven't heard about the Fairport man who killed himself and his daughter.Namely that the man, John Beilman, was a ""key witness"" in the Las Vegas mass shooting and was ""wanted by federal agents"" in connection to the massacre.It isn't true, but it's been widely circulated online via social media courtesy of bogus news websites and their readers, most of whom are unschooled in news literacy and unable to parse fact from fiction.The Beilman-Las Vegas connection appears to have originated on a website called WhatDoesItMean.com in a report dated Oct. 7 under the bizarre byline of ""Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers.""Faal is a suspected pseudonym of the website's owner. Shoddy and fictitious sourcing, half-truths and bewildering leaps of logic are trademarks of her reporting.:None of this has stopped her story from being circulated by websites known to publish schlock and sensational disinformation for the purpose of profiting through clickbait. Two such sites are Neon Nettle and USSA News, which bills itself as ""The Tea Party's Front Page.""From there, the story has been spread like wildfire on social media by unsophisticated news illiterates whose reality is so muddied they can't tell truth from fiction anymore. It's sad and dangerous and undermining our institutions.Is it coincidence that Beilman committed the murder-suicide within hours of the FBI search of his home? We don't know for sure, but probably not. It's very likely that the search motivated Beilman to act.What federal agents were looking for at Beilman's house hasn't been reported because the search warrant affidavit, which was signed by a judge authorizing the search, is under seal.The 1 October mass shooting in Las Vegas has prompted a slew of conspiracy theories and hoaxes, many focused on the involvement of ""second shooter."" During a press briefing on the day after the massacre, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Assistant Sheriff Todd Fasulo directly rejected such theories::I want to emphasize we believe Paddock is solely responsible for this heinous act. We are aware of the rumors outside of the media and also on social media that there was more than one assailant. We have no information or evidence to support that theory, or that rumor. We believe there was only one shooter and that was Stephen Paddock. "
256,256,412.FakeCelebritySkinCar,"Despite what you may read on the Internet, Priscilla Chan -- pediatrician, philanthropist, and wife of Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg -- has not launched her own skin care venture, nor is she offering ""free trials"" of an anti-aging wrinkle cream she supposedly invented.Nor, for that matter, is reality television star Joanna Gaines quitting her popular HGTV series Fixer Upper to promote her own ""anti-aging serum"" called VLamorous, or Fox News pundit Sean Hannity's wife, Jill Rhodes, selling a ""plastic surgery alternative"" called Nouveau Restor Revitalizing Moisturizer.Celebrities aren't the only victims of a long-running Internet scam that uses fake celebrity endorsements to peddle skin care products online. Ordinary individuals who fall for the advertorials (s written to look like articles) in some cases wind up bilked out of hundreds of dollars. The perpetrators use networks of bogus web sites, social media, and e-commerce technology to trick users into ordering ""free trials"" of supposedly celebrity-endorsed products, only to find they've unknowingly signed up to receive regular shipments for which they're automatically charged on a monthly basis.:The Internet is rife with consumer complaints about these scams. ""I saw an ad on Facebook about some eye serum and eye cream,"" one user wrote on a web site devoted to reporting fraud:All you pay is shipping & handling. Nowhere did they say you started an automatic shipment every month. When I received the shipment, there were no papers inside box describing it or telling me anything about the auto ship. There was no return address either. Two weeks after, I was billed $97.43 for eye serum and $98.66 for eye cream. When I called, they said I only paid for shipment and since I didn't call or return products I was charged for a whole product then. What a rip-off!!! I haven't even used the crap!The creators of these advertorials exhibit just as few scruples with regard to the accuracy of their claims as they do in their financial dealings. The ad for the product supposedly touted by Sean Hannity's wife was built around rumors proclaiming that Hannity might be fired by Fox News for pushing a conspiracy theory on his program after being ordered not to:::The ad didn't merely mention the conspiracy theory that got Hannity in trouble; it named names and repeated hurtful and disproven allegations:Sean Hannity has recently been caught in the cross fire surrounding the slaying of Seth Rich. Conspiracy theorists have claimed the 27-year-old DNC staffer was murdered last summer in Washington in retaliation for being WikiLeaks' source of party emails later published online. The U.S. intelligence community, though, concluded it was Russian hackers who infiltrated the DNC and not the work of an internal whistleblower. Washington police consider Rich's murder to have been a botched robbery attempt.Despite continued instruction to drop the story, Hannity continued pushing the theory on his radio show. After this blatant refusal to obey orders, rumors instantly swirled about Hannity being fired. Hannity was forced to openly admit he would stop this tirad but it was too late. After this bombshell, rumors began to swirl about Sean Hannity and his possible departure from Fox News after this tragic murder causing journalists to dig deeper into Hannity's life.This intense speculation led to investigators prying into the entire Hannity family, revealing Jill's multi-million dollar secret.:Jill's ""multi-million dollar secret,"" of course, was that she supposedly developed her own skin care line, making her the ""breadwinner of the Hannity household."" The Fox News host said the claims were false in an e-mailed statement to the Daily Beast:Hannity confirmed that the ad was ""all a lie"" in an email on Wednesday. ""I have my attorneys on it. Fake news,"" he wrote.In an interesting twist on an otherwise boringly common scam, the Daily Beast found that the bogus Hannity ad was also distributed via the right-leaning e-mail list ""Lifelong Conservative,"" which is operated by a marketing company connected with the Prosper Group, a political consulting firm that has worked for the likes of Donald Trump and Mike Pence. The version of the scam using the name and likeness of Priscilla Chan appeared online in April 2017. Chan, said the article, formulated her own ""natural, holistic"" skin care line about which ""Ivy League scientists"" and ""Hollywood dermatologists"" were raving:::A spokesperson for Priscilla Chan confirmed the obvious:Neither Priscilla's name nor likeness were approved for use in this  -- it is both false and misleading.Nor was the use of Mark Zuckerberg's name and likeness authorized, despite appearing in this and a previous iteration of the advertorial which claimed that Zuckerberg was quitting Facebook to become a cosmeceutical mogul.The web site on which the Priscilla Chan advertorial was posted (www.piop.net) contained literally dozens more examples following the same formula, each featuring a different celebrity. Kellyanne Conway, Joanna Gaines, Melania Trump, Ivanka Trump, Scarlett Johansson, Ann Coulter, Joy Behar, Ellen Degeneres, Meryl Streep, and Kate Middleton are just a few of the names used.Actress Pauley Perrette, star of the CBS television series NCIS, joined the ranks of celebrities whose names were appropriated for fake advertising in September 2017. ""These are false ads, totally false,"" Perrette said in a statement provided to snopes.com. ""I don't have a skin care product line and I don't endorse one. My entire skin care treatment involves soap, water and baby oil. These ghost companies are ripping off my fans and I'm upset about it."" Perrette appeared on the television show Inside Edition to warn consumers away from the ads.:Among the many web sites we found cranking out similar false and misleading content were wshape.com (which mimics Shape magazine's web site), peoplesmag-mobile.com (which mimics People), total-health-choice.com/people (also mimicking People), stories-people.com, peoplemz.com, healthyheadlines.co, 42news.net, and many others (more than we could count). Since these web sites spring up and disappear quickly, many of those that we found are already defunct. We found that in some instances multiple sites with similar domain names are hosted on the same servers; in other cases the sites were freestanding. When we looked up the geographical locations of these servers, we found some scattered around Europe (in the Netherlands and Iceland, for example), and others in the United States. In every case we were able to check, ownership of the domain names was anonymized.Things get risky for users visiting these sites (usually after encountering links in social media posts) when they click on a button inviting them to claim their ""free trial,"" which sends them to an e-commerce site warning that ""stocks are limited,"" so they should submit their order right away::From there, users are then shunted to a second page (where they're informed, yet again, that stocks are limited) and instructed to enter credit card information to cover a modest $4.95 shipping fee in order to receive their ""free trial"" product.:What is all too easy to miss (when it can be found at all) is the block of fine (and excruciatingly faint) print toward the bottom of the page informing users they're signing up for way more than just a free trial:In case you weren't able to read that, it says that by submitting your order you ""concent"" [sic] to being enrolled in the company's ""membership program,"" for which you will be charged $98.66 plus shipping per month (per the company's Terms & Conditions, which say, among other things, that by so ""concenting"" you will give up your right to take them to court).People who say they've been victimized by these sites typically relate horror stories about the companies giving them the runaround when they try to get their money back:They showed many before & after pictures and used a testimonial from Melania Trump to sell the products. There was NO mention of having to send the samples back or of agreeing to receive more at full price in the ads I viewed. In fact I have no address to use if I did want to return them. When I called them they said I was 3 days past the deadline and they couldn't refund my money, but did offer me a 30% discount for calling. When I asked to speak to a supervisor I was told none were available.:Such complaints are all-too-familiar to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which warns that so-called ""free trial"" offers almost always come with hidden costs or strings attached:If you're tempted to sign up for a ""free"" trial offer, keep these tips in mind:Do some research online. Search for the name of the product and words like ""review,"" ""complaint,"" or ""scam"" to see what others are saying.Read the fine print. Look for hidden fees and details on how to cancel shipments. You might find them in the fine print in ads or on sites for the products.Monitor your credit and debit card statements. If you're charged for something you didn't order, you can work on disputing those charges.Consumers should also note any dates or time limits mentioned in such offers. Typically, there is a deadline for canceling an order if one wishes to get a refund and/or avoid paying further charges.:Anywhere there is fine print, read it.The Federal Trade Commission has taken legal action against the operators of web sites using these tactics in the past. In 2016, they obtained court orders permanently barring 29 defendants in California from running businesses that sell products via a ""negative option"" -- meaning the consumer's silence is automatically interpreted as consent. But as we have seen, those 29 people now banned from scamming the public were only the tip of the iceberg.""The Commission will continue to attack scams that rely on supposed 'free trial' offers and unauthorized credit card charges,"" former Bureau of Consumer Protection Director Jessica Rich said after the 2016 court orders were handed down. In the meantime, consumers need to stay vigilant to avoid possible online scams.Anyone who feels they were defrauded by this type of marketing is encouraged to report it online to the FTC.:"
257,257,252.DidIkeSayIfaPolitica,"Claim:President Eisenhower said that a political party must be dedicated to the advancement of a moral cause, otherwise it is just a conspiracy to seize power.Rating:Correct AttributionAbout this rating Internet users are rightly skeptical of any piece of media featuring an image of a person and a quote, as this category of content more often than not contains fabricated or misattributed messages. Every once in awhile, however, the internet gets it right, as was the case for this meme featuring an image of President Dwight D. Eisenhower and a quote concerning the objective of political parties:::If a political party does not have its foundation in the determination to advance a cause that is right and that is moral, then it is not a political party; it is merely a conspiracy to seize power.This statement was taken from a speech President Eisenhower delivered at the Fourth Annual Republican Women's National Conference on 6 March 1956.Below we've reproduced the relevant portion of this speech, which can be read in its entirety on the University of California Santa Barbara's web site for the American Presidency Project:It is always, for me, a special privilege to address the women of this Party. First of all, for a very practical reason, they tell me there are more women in the United States than there are men. But secondly, I have the most deep conviction that a political party can be called such only if its whole purposes are soundly based in some moral and spiritual values.The women of this nation are more concerned in their day by day work, I think, than are men with these values. They have the job of rearing our young, those youngsters who are so dear to all our hearts, and they want them to grow up with the right kind of values embedded in them so that as they meet the problems of life they will always have a certain kind of principle, or doctrine, or belief to fall back on that will help guide them through the rough spots.I think the women, therefore, must be concerned with these values, and I return to my statement that if a political party does not have its foundation in the determination to advance a cause that is right and that is moral, then it is not a political party; it is merely a conspiracy to seize power.:"
258,258,167.WereThereIrishSlaves,"Claim:Early in America's history, white Irish slaves outnumbered Black slaves and endured worse treatment at the hands of their masters.Rating:MixtureAbout this rating What's TrueLike impoverished people of other nationalities and ethnicities, many people emigrated from Ireland to the Americas in the 17th and 18th centuries as indentured servants; a smaller number were forcibly banished into indentured servitude during the period of the English Civil Wars; indentured servants often lived and worked under harsh conditions and were sometimes treated cruelly.What's FalseUnlike institutionalized chattel slavery, indentured servitude was neither hereditary nor lifelong; unlike Black slaves, white indentured servants had legal rights; unlike Black slaves, indentured servants weren't considered property.:A facet of U.S. history largely unfamiliar to Americans themselves is the role of indentured servitude in the survival and growth of the original 13 colonies. The earliest settlers needed laborers, but only wealthy people could afford passage to the New World. This led to a system whereby those who lacked means were brought from Europe under contract to work off their passage, room, and board over a period of two to seven years, until they were considered to have earned their freedom. No fewer than half of the immigrants who came to the New World during the colonial period arrived as indentured servants. Among the many thousands of impoverished Europeans brought over in this fashion were men, women, and children from England, Ireland, Scotland, Germany, and elsewhere, but over the intervening centuries the notion has arisen that the Irish, in particular, were shipped to the New World as ""white slaves."" In fact, according to an article first published on the internet in 2008 and endlessly recirculated since, Irish slaves were not only common in early America, they were more common than African slaves, and often treated more harshly. The article making these claims is usually credited to an individual named John Martin, who, in turn, found most of his ""facts"" in a 2003 article by James F. Cavanaugh called ""Irish Slaves in the Caribbean."" It has gone by many names, but as of mid-2016, the most shared version of the Irish slave narrative was entitled ""Irish: The Forgotten White Slaves,"" and posted under the byline of a man named Ronald Dwyer.:Regardless of who is or isn't credited with writing it, nearly every iteration of the piece begins in exactly the same way:They came as slaves: human cargo transported on British ships bound for the Americas. They were shipped by the hundreds of thousands and included men, women, and even the youngest of children.Whenever they rebelled or even disobeyed an order, they were punished in the harshest ways. Slave owners would hang their human property by their hands and set their hands or feet on fire as one form of punishment. Some were burned alive and had their heads placed on pikes in the marketplace as a warning to other captives.We don't really need to go through all of the gory details, do we? We know all too well the atrocities of the African slave trade.But are we talking about African slavery? King James VI and Charles I also led a continued effort to enslave the Irish. Britain's Oliver Cromwell furthered this practice of dehumanizing one's next door neighbor.:The Irish slave trade began when James VI sold 30,000 Irish prisoners as slaves to the New World. His Proclamation of 1625 required Irish political prisoners be sent overseas and sold to English settlers in the West Indies.By the mid 1600s, the Irish were the main slaves sold to Antigua and Montserrat. At that time, 70% of the total population of Montserrat were Irish slaves.Ireland quickly became the biggest source of human livestock for English merchants. The majority of the early slaves to the New World were actually white.From 1641 to 1652, over 500,000 Irish were killed by the English and another 300,000 were sold as slaves. Ireland's population fell from about 1,500,000 to 600,000 in one single decade. Families were ripped apart as the British did not allow Irish dads to take their wives and children with them across the Atlantic. This led to a helpless population of homeless women and children. Britain's solution was to auction them off as well.Woven throughout is the implication that the reason so few Americans know anything about the so-called ""forgotten"" history of Irish slavery is that it has been excluded from ""biased"" history books.:Indentured Servitude vs. Chattel Slavery Limerick-based research librarian and historian Liam Hogan takes aim at this notion in a series of papers debunking what he calls ""the Irish slaves myth."" There were no Irish slaves in the Americas, Hogan says. People who claim there were are conflating indentured servitude with chattel slavery -- two distinct forms of servitude with more differences between them than similarities: ""White indentured servitude was so very different from black slavery as to be from another galaxy of human experience,"" as Donald Harman Akenson put it in If the Irish Ran the World: Montserrat, 1630-1730. How so? Chattel slavery was perpetual, a slave was only free once they they were no longer alive; it was hereditary, the children of slaves were the property of their owner; the status of chattel slave was designated by 'race', there was no escaping your bloodline; a chattel slave was treated like livestock, you could kill your slaves while applying ""moderate correction"" and the homicide law would not apply; the execution of 'insolent' slaves was encouraged in these slavocracies to deter insurrections and disobedience, and their owners were paid generous compensation for their 'loss'; an indentured servant could appeal to a court of law if they were mistreated, a slave had no recourse for justice.:The Race Factor Hogan pins a 2014 resurgence of the Irish slaves narrative to increasing racial tensions within the United States, situating it within a larger world view desirous of absolving white Europeans of blame for the transatlantic slave trade that brought an estimated 12 million Africans to the New World in lifelong bondage:From Stormfront.org, a self-described online community of white nationalists, to David Icke's February 2014 interview with Infowars.com, the narrative of the 'White slaves' is continuously promoted. The most influential book to claim that there was 'white slavery' in Colonial America was Michael Hoffman's They Were White and They Were Slaves: The Untold History of the Enslavement of Whites in Early America. Self-published in 1993, Hoffman, a Holocaust denier, unsurprisingly blames the Atlantic slave trade on the Jews. By blurring the lines between the different forms of unfree labour, these white supremacists seek to conceal the incontestable fact that these slavocracies were controlled by -- and operated for the benefit of -- white Europeans. This narrative, which exists almost exclusively in the United States, is essentially a form of nativism and racism masquerading as conspiracy theory.:That the institution of chattel slavery in America was founded on race is undeniable. Beginning in the late 1600s, the colonies all adopted ""slave codes"" which, among other things, routinely defined slaves as ""Negro"" or ""African,"" according to the Encyclopedia Britannica: In all of them the color line was firmly drawn, and any amount of African heritage established the race of a person as black, with little regard as to whether the person was slave or free. The status of the offspring followed that of the mother, so that the child of a free father and a slave mother was a slave. Slaves had few legal rights: in court their testimony was inadmissible in any litigation involving whites; they could make no contract, nor could they own property; even if attacked, they could not strike a white person. The Dred Scott decision handed down by the Supreme Court in 1857 reaffirmed that racialized definition of slavery. The 7 to 2 decision in Scott v. Sanford held that plaintiff Dred Scott, a Black slave, did not qualify as an American citizen and had no standing to sue in federal court because, in part, persons imported as slaves ""had for more than a century before been regarded as beings of an inferior order""::In the opinion of the court, the legislation and histories of the times, and the language used in the Declaration of Independence, show, that neither the class of persons who had been imported as slaves, nor their descendants, whether they had become free or not, were then acknowledged as a part of the people, nor intended to be included in the general words used in that memorable instrument ... They had for more than a century before been regarded as beings of an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in social or political relations; and so far inferior, that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect; and that the negro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit.Mistreatment of the Irish In terms of historical accuracy, the Irish slave story is a hodgepodge. For example, the ""Proclamation of 1625"" supposedly requiring all Irish prisoners to be sent overseas did not exist. You won't find it in any history books. There was a 1603 proclamation by James I ordering that ""rogues, vagabonds, idle, and dissolute persons"" be ""banished and conveyed"" to ""places and parts beyond the seas,"" etc., but this was not directed at the Irish in particular. It was put to use decades later in the wake of the English Civil Wars, however, as a justification for forcibly shipping thousands of Irish prisoners, vagrants, and orphans to the Caribbean as indentured servants. More than any other, this historical fact inspired the notion that the Irish were enslaved. Still, the text wildly exaggerates the number of those treated in this fashion, falsely claiming that ""300,000 were sold as slaves."" (Liam Hogan unravels these and similar statistical misrepresentations in ""A Review of the Numbers in the Irish Slaves Meme.""):Words Matter That thousands of Irish people were carried across the sea against their will and indentured to serve on plantations isn't disputed. It happened. What's in question is whether or not they are rightly referred to as ""slaves."" Some writers, such as genealogist and Irish Times columnist John Grenham, ask why not:The labor they did was slave labor, and their circumstances were much worse than those of the indentured workers who traveled at the same time and later, not least because indentured work, though often harsh, was voluntary and time-limited. Refusing to call them slaves is quibbling.Is it mere quibbling? Generically speaking, any form of forced labor can be called slavery. But what do we gain by doing so, besides blurring historical distinctions? Consider impressment, the 18th-century British naval practice of kidnapping young men and forcing them to serve on sailing vessels. That's slavery, in a sense. So is being sentenced to hard labor in prison. But while these share features in common with the institution of chattel slavery in America, they are on a whole separate plane.:It isn't ""bias"" that keeps legitimate historians from substituting the term ""slavery"" for ""impressment,"" ""hard labor,"" or even ""forced indentured servitude."" It's a simple respect for the facts. "
259,259,175.NoaVideoDoesntShowMa,"Claim:U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene auditioned for the television talent show ""American Idol.""Rating:MiscaptionedAbout this rating Fact CheckIn early September 2022, a video went viral that showed a young blonde woman auditioning for the television singing competition ""American Idol,"" which first aired in 2002. The reason the video gained so much popularity in 2022, a full two decades after that particular episode of the show aired, was because the woman bore a physical resemblance to U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia.:Here is a screenshot of the Sept. 4, 2022, post on the social media platform Twitter::The woman in the video above identifies herself as Stefanie Sugarman from Alta Loma, a community in Southern California's Inland Empire. The video of Sugarman's audition has been online for years, apparently because she gained a degree of internet fame for giving an outlandish performance:Our research confirms these are two completely different people, which we will explain below.:Clues from the Video A few tells from the video itself:  The woman in the video has a different talking voice than Greene and no Southern accent; the ""American Idol"" hopeful said she was from Alta Loma, a community in Southern California, and was 23 years old at the time of the audition; she also said she worked in marketing, specifically selling cheese.In 2002, the year the episode aired, Greene, who was born in 1974, would have been 28. Greene has furthermore always lived and worked in Georgia, per some biographical information we found on her, and never lived in California selling cheese.Why Do People Think It's Greene?Misinformation stating Greene is the person in the video exploits the fact that the two women physically resemble each other. Greene is a polarizing political figure who generally tends to get a lot of internet and media attention because of her incendiary profile and support for conspiracy theories. She is herself the subject of various internet rumors and discourse, which are sometimes false and sometimes true.:We reached out to Greene's spokesman Nick Dyer, who offered a rather snarky confirmation that Greene wasn't the singer in the video.""Quite frankly, if your readers aren't smart enough to see through this Blue Anon conspiracy theory, there's nothing that will convince them otherwise,"" Dyer wrote in an email.So What Is 'Blue Anon'?""Blue Anon"" is a play on the term ""Qanon,"" a conspiracy theory that holds high-profile Democrats and celebrities are part of a satanic child trafficking cabal, and that former U.S. President Donald Trump was secretly leading a fight against the cabal. ""Q"" was the moniker of an alleged high-level government source dropping clues. It is one of the conspiracy theories Greene has been criticized for promoting before her 2020 election. ""Blue Anon"" refers to the use of the color blue by Democratic political figures.:We asked Dyer for comment on Greene's past support for Qanon. He pointed us to a speech Greene gave on the House floor before being stripped of committee assignments, in which she stated she regretted her past remarks on the subject, but was ""allowed"" to believe them because of her dissatisfaction with the American government. Nevertheless, in February 2021, her personal Twitter account was suspended for violating the platform's policies against spreading misinformation about COVID-19. She had also promoted false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen via mass-scale voter fraud.Who is Stefanie Sugarman?In the video, Sugarman dances wildly before appearing before the judges and singing her rendition of ""Knockin' da Boots"" by the rhythm and blues group H-Town. The performance earned her a rejection from the show's judges, Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul, and Randy Jackson, the latter of whom told her, ""Stefanie, you're not a very good singer."" :Sugarman reacted in disbelief, and even went back into the judge's room to confirm her rejection, asserting that she was, in fact, a good singer. Since the episode, which was part of ""American Idol's"" first season, she has maintained a level of internet fame, often appearing in tributes or compilations of ""funny"" or ""bad"" ""American Idol"" auditions.That dressing down by the judges may have put another person off singing forever, but not Sugarman. Despite her rejection from the show, Sugarman kept singing. She now has a powerful alto voice and goes by the stage name ""Sugarwolf.""Sugarman's talent manager, Tanesia Tramell, confirmed in an email to Snopes that Sugarman is the person in the viral video (not Greene). Sugarman even has a single, ""Back to Me,"" coming out at the end of the first week of September 2022.""Stefanie was very young and didn't really have the correct team to guide her on song choices back then,"" Tramell said. ""However, she is actually a brilliant and very soulful singer."":"

Rating:FalseAbout this rating On May 19, 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden stopped by the Ford River Rouge Complex in Dearborn, Michigan, to tour the company's production facility for the new all-electric F-150 Lightning. At the end of the visit, Biden said that he was a ""car guy"" and that he would like to test drive the new vehicle. Ford obliged, and the president took a spin in the new electric vehicle, saying at the end of the ride that ""this sucker's quick."":Here's a video of Biden's test drive from The Associated Press:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZE4_YXGBiI&t=50sWhile this moment was largely uneventful (although some took issue with a joke Biden made about hitting a reporter), hyperpartisan news outlets and social media personalities claimed that this video actually documented a deepening conspiracy about Biden's health. The website Gateway Pundit published a slow-motion clip taken from C-SPAN's footage and claimed that it showed how Biden was ""faking"" this test drive, and that the truck was actually being controlled by the person in the passenger seat via a second steering wheel. The Gateway Pundit wrote:WOW! Biden Caught Fake Driving -- Someone Else Is Steering Vehicle -- It Was All a Stunt! -- VIDEO and PICS[...]Following his speech, the declining septuagenarian was put in an electric vehicle where he pretended to be driving. This was all a show by his handlers to make Joe Biden look like he's in charge.:Biden did not ""fake"" drive this truck, and this all-electric vehicle was not equipped with two steering wheels. Mike Levine, Ford North America product communications manager, confirmed to the automative news website Jalopnik  that ""there was no other set of controls"" in the vehicle Biden drove. The object the Gateway Pundit claims the passenger is holding in this video is not a steering wheel. It's a camera. It appears that the secret service agent was simply reaching out to make sure that this camera didn't fall off the dashboard. Here's an enlarged image showing this moment. The Gateway Pundit's main piece of ""evidence"" for the double-driver conspiracy theory is superimposed in the top left::Furthermore, other images exist showing other angles of the drive that make it clear this vehicle didn't have two steering wheels. At the end of the above-displayed video from The Associated Press, for instance, you can get a glimpse through the windshield that shows Biden's hands on the steering wheel and no steering wheel visible on the passenger side. At another moment, we get a view through the passenger side windows which, again, shows Biden with his hands on the wheel and the passenger without a steering wheel. This moment is more clearly visible in the original video from from C-SPAN. :https://www.c-span.org/video/?511860-101/president-biden-test-drives-ford-electric-vehicle The claim that Biden ""fake"" drove this vehicle can also be disproven by the fact that this drive wasn't entirely scheduled. If you noticed in these videos, there is some odd material hanging on the side of this all-electric F-150 Lightning. This is not part of the design of the vehicle that will be available for purchase. This is a sort of camouflage that the company uses to obscure the public's view of vehicles before they are officially released. The Detroit Free Press reported that Ford had to scramble a little after Biden asked to test drive one of their vehicles.President Biden, 78, whose father sold Fords back in the day, wrapped up his remarks on Tuesday at the new plant in the Rouge complex designed to build the all-electric F-150 Lightning and it all seemed routine to those present.:Until it wasn't.""At the end of his speech, he kinda turned to everyone, he goes, 'You know I'm a car guy. And I want to drive this truck.' Everyone politely laughed. Because presidents don't drive vehicles,'"" Ford CEO Jim Farley told the Free Press ... And then it happened.""Lo and behold, I get a tap on my shoulder (apparently from White House staff) at the very end of the event,"" Farley said. ""They said, 'Mr. Farley, we'd like you to come with us to the motorcade because we want to go to the test track and drive the truck.""So Farley and chief engineer Linda Zhang went together to a Ford test track nearby.""All the media was there. And the whole presidential motorcade,"" Farley said. ""We've never had the presidential motorcade at our test track before. I think all our team members were kind of stunned to see the president of the United States come to the test track. We didn't really have any warning."":""It was a game time decision,"" said Mark Truby, global head of Ford communications. "

But at the same time that many people are seemingly appreciating those around them, our new research has found that COVID-19 has led to a rise in online Islamophobic hate speech. My colleague, Roxana Khan-Williams, and I have examined the impacts of COVID-19 on social media. We've found that COVID-19 has been used by the far-right to peddle Islamophobic hate. Our study provides a snapshot of the type of language used online about Muslims and COVID-19. And what we've found is that stereotypes fuelled by conspiracy theories, memes and fake videos create the perfect climate for the demonisation of Muslims. :One video, for example, shared on the Tommy Robinson News channel on the messaging app Telegram, alleges to show a group of Muslim men leaving a secret mosque in Birmingham to pray. Despite the fact the video is fake and West Midlands Police have confirmed the mosque is closed, it has been watched over 14,000 times. At risk of attacksAs someone who has spent their academic career researching Islamophobia, I am not surprised or shocked to see this level of vitriolic hate. But it does demonstrate how quickly the internet can act as an echo chamber - and how easily such narratives become normalised.Even more worrying, is that this type of Islamophobic bigotry found on social media reinforces the ""them versus us narrative"" by using issues such as deprivation, poverty, social cohesion and social mobility as a Muslim problem. Indeed, many of the online posts we analysed targeted Muslims because of social and economic issues. All of which leaves Muslims more at risk of Islamophobic attacks when lockdown lifts.:The tweet below, for example, specifically labels Muslims as ""muzrats"", a word used to describe Muslims as vermin and a disease.We also found that levels of Islamophobia increase around certain events. Ramadan, for example, seems to have led to a wave of conspiracy theories around Muslims - with claims the virus is likely to spread around this time. We also found the depiction of British Muslims on social media was synonymous with ""deviance"" and being a ""problem-group"". And that a number of fake news stories featured claims that Muslims are flouting social distancing measures to attend mosque. One picture, for example, taken outside a Leeds mosque appears to show Muslims breaking the rules of lockdown, despite this having been taken two weeks before the official lockdown began.In another example of fake news, a Twitter user claimed to have spoken to his local mosque in Shrewsbury. The user claimed to be ""horrified"" to find out this mosque was still open, adding that people inside could be ""super spreaders"" of the virus, and urged the police to act. The police have confirmed, however, that there is no mosque in Shrewsbury.:Similarly, a picture emerged on Twitter that seemed to show Muslims praying on the streets of central London and not adhering to social distancing rules. Again, the story was debunked as the picture had been taken several weeks ago. 'Muslims are the enemy'The problem with such disinformation is that it can lead to wider retribution against Muslims. On one Facebook post, for example, messages from users indicated they wanted Muslims ""off the streets!!"", another added that Muslims are ""praying in groups then driving taxis afterwards"". We also found evidence of users focusing on grooming events in Rotherham to call British Muslims ""deviant"". Another user stated that ""all over the world these ignorant religious idiots are responsible for spreading this further"". This led to wider dehumanising language around wanting British Muslims to go ""back home"".Evidence suggests that BAME people seem to be the most impacted by COVID-19. Figures show that 35% of almost 2000 patients in intensive care units are from a BAME background, compared to 14% of the UK population. And the sad truth is that, as we fight the pandemic offline, a pandemic is also spreading online. :Social media companies must do more to tackle this and remove posts that are clearly using dehumanising language. If not, the risk is that this could escalate to attacks and incidents when restrictions on movement are lifted.:Imran Awan, Professor of Criminology, Birmingham City UniversityThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

262,262,623.DoUncancelledStampsP,"Claim:The lack of postmarks on explosive devices mailed to Democratic officials proves those items were not sent through the USPS.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In October 2018, multiple parcels housing mail bombs were sent to various Democrats and critics of President Trump, including the Clintons, the Obamas, Joe Biden, George Soros, and actor Robert de Niro.  According to various accounts, the packages included ""explosive devices made from PVC pipe and contained a timer (likely a digital alarm clock) to set off the detonator. The powder contained in the bombs comes from pyrotechnics. X-rays show there was likely shrapnel inside the PVC pipe.""  None of the devices detonated, and no one was injured by them.:The devices were typically sent in lumpy manila envelopes bearing the return address of ex-Democratic National Committee chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and six postage stamps.  Conspiracy-minded persons quickly seized on that last aspect to sow doubt on the claims that the packages had actually been mailed through the USPS and instead fostered a theory that the bombs were a ""false flag"" operation intended to influence the upcoming midterm elections.  Their evidence?  That the stamps seen in news pictures of the packages were uncancelled, demonstrating that the parcels had not in fact gone through the mail system::Stamps used for mailed items are generally postmarked, or ""cancelled"" -- that is, as the mailed items make their way through the postal system, the stamps are marked with wavy black lines and a postmark bearing the location and date of first processing in order to prevent the re-use of the stamps.  So, the conspiracy logic went, a package bearing uncancelled stamps clearly could not have actually been shipped through the postal system.However, it's not the case that the every item sent through the U.S. Postal Service is postmarked.  The agency's own page on the subject notes that ""Postmarks are not required for mailings bearing a permit, meter, or precanceled stamp for postage, nor to pieces with an indicia applied by various postage evidencing systems.""None of those exceptions seemed applicable to the packages containing the explosive devices, however, as they bore ordinary stamps and not postage metering or precanceled stamps.  However, the fact is that a whole lot of mailed items do actually make their way through the USPS system without being cancelled, as Washington TV station WUSA noted::Scott English, Executive Director from the American Philatelic Society sent WUSA9 News researchers the following statement:""Many have observed that the delivered packages have stamps but no cancellations, meaning they did not go through the U.S. Postal Service. This is not accurate because many packages are delivered with uncancelled postage.There are estimates of up to 80 percent of packages delivered through the mail are delivered without cancellations. Most mail is machine-canceled but many packages must be hand-canceled. Those cancellations are either traditional date stamp or a magic marker line drawn over the stamps. There is no uniform standard at local post offices so chandelling postage on package is typically skipped because of workload issues.""And as NBC News observed more specifically, in this case the nature of the packaging explained why these particular parcels were not postmarked:While some have made note of the fact that the devices were not postmarked, multiple officials have said this was not uncommon, and that because of the soft packaging they could not go through automated sorting machines to have their postage canceled.Four separate officials briefed on, or involved with, the investigation have told NBC that some packages were not postmarked because the soft packaging could not go through the postal machines.:On 26 October 2018, 56-year-old Florida resident Cesar Sayoc was arrested on suspicion of having mailed the explosive devices:Sayoc, 56, was arrested on Friday morning in South Florida and now faces federal five federal crimes including; transporting explosives across state lines, illegally mailing explosives, threatening former presidents and others, threatening interstate communications and assaulting federal officialsAfter Sayoc was taken into custody, the FBI confirmed they found another package. This one was addressed to prominent Democratic donor Tom Steyer in California, bringing the total to 14 suspicious packages addressed to 12 targets.Authorities say they are looking for more packages and investigating if Sayoc had any help making these improvised devices. The homemade bombs ""are not hoax devices,"" Wray stressed on Friday."

Rating:FalseAbout this rating Sometimes, people just don't assimilate accurate information, even when it's virtually handed to them, because they remain focused on something that is untrue yet so alarming or sensational that it commands their attention and drowns out consideration of contradictory facts.:Case in point: the following meme, which was widely circulated via social media in mid-2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic::The meme's allusions to presidential candidate Joe Biden, vaccines, secret patents, and the furtive tracking of citizens pushed so many conspiracy theory buttons that many viewers missed the statement at the bottom of the meme that said ""none of this is true.""As the bottom portion of the meme text states, the person referenced here is William A. Mitchell -- a real scientist, but not one involved with the development of vaccines. Mitchell was a food scientist, the person responsible for developing such well known tasty treats as Cool Whip topping, Pop Rocks candy, and Tang powdered drinks.Mitchell retired in 1976, and died in 2004, so clearly he had nothing to do with patenting a vaccine -- or anything else -- in 2012.The point of someone compiling this memetic factual tomfoolery is stated at the bottom of the graphic: a warning to viewers to ""Stop getting your news from memes and calling it research!"":We note, for the record, that even the meme's deliberate attempt at presenting misinformation was wrong, whether intentionally or otherwise. Although the photograph used in the meme appears on a web page about Mitchell, it's actually a picture of Oswald Theodore Avery, a Canadian-American physician and medical researcher."

""Is this true, can you take my child?"" she is asked.The Facebook post those parents had seen began going viral mid-August. It's one of several similar posts seen in the UK and Australia, and follows a pattern in many posts linked to the QAnon conspiracy theory. These often include a direct appeal to parents, challenging the reader to do their own research to ""prove"" the veracity of the claim, a call to defend individual rights against big government, elites, or some undefined ""they"".:Part of a Facebook post from August 11 that was marked as false information by Facebook.via FacebookDespite being quickly fact-checked and tagged as false, this and related posts which use the hashtag #SaveTheChildren are still circulating and the phrase ""covid act 2020 children in school"" still comes up as an autofill option if you search for ""covid act"" on Google.The power of memesFor the past five years, my research has looked at how strangers talk with each other about politics on Facebook. I've focused on four English constituencies - Stoke-on-Trent Central, Burton and Uttoxeter, Bristol West and Brighton Pavilion - tracking conversations through public pages, posts and public information on people's timelines and profiles. Through the 2015, 2017 and 2019 UK general elections, I saw the increased polarisation of those Facebook conversations and with it increased incivility, partisanship and sectarianism. I was struck by the rising use of memes and how a handful of core themes made their way from meme to belief. During the 2019 election, I noticed how memes from far right US Facebook pages were being posted and spread via people in the UK constituencies I was studying.:I recently decided to explore how the upcoming US election might be translating into partisan ideas on Facebook in the UK. I decided to focus on one meme, and the individual Facebook users who cared enough about that issue to share or comment publicly - and see where it took me. So, in late August, I returned to Facebook after a seven-month gap and picked the meme that happened to be at the top of my timeline - a post from the group Migrant Watch shared by the page of UKIP Brighton & Hove. This was consistently one of the most active meme-seeders among the constituency party Facebook groups I follow. I'd found links during the last election between the active seeding of anti-migrant, anti-immigration memes by UK users and US far-right organisations and individuals, and so I expected to find similar links through that meme. But what I hadn't expected to see was for the meme to lead me to UK mums and grandmothers engaging with QAnon conspiracy theories from the US. Where can one meme take you?Author provided:QAnon conspiraciesOf the 45 people to comment on this Migration Watch meme shared by Brighton & Hove UKIP - 27 were women and most, from what I could tell from their profiles, were middle-aged grandmothers. When I looked at what other content these women were sharing, I found memes about anti-animal cruelty, anti-Black Lives Matter protests, anti-BBC proms and content in favour of Brexit. Some of the women were also worried about the threat to ""our"" children posed by paedophile rings. And in this they demonstrated the next level of political meme sharing - freely interacting with content from both the UK and the US. For one woman that meant sharing conspiracy theories from Mama Wolf, one of the Facebook accounts circulating QAnon content. One of these was entitled ""Epstein Islands frequent flyers"" a hotch-potch of unfounded accusations linking Hilary Clinton, Oprah Winfrey, Bill Gates, Madonna, the Queen, and other (mostly black or Jewish) ""elites"" to the late Jeffrey Epstein, a global child trafficking network, drugs harvested from children's blood, and secret messages coded into Trump's press briefings on his plans to save the children.:I found one of the same Facebook users who had shared the Migration Watch meme also sharing a post calling for people to flood the BBC's Facebook page on August 25 with the #saveourchildren tag. ""They won't cover child trafficking so we will bring it to them. It's time to take this up a level,"" said the meme. Far right memes from the US are being shared and spread in the UK.TY Lim/ShutterstockHidden radicalisationThe bubble communities we inhabit on Facebook shield us from alternative views to our own, while also making it easier for views to be reinforced, enhanced - groomed even - towards more radical positions. Facebook encourages pools of the like-minded, whether through architecture that encourages what the activist Eli Pariser's termed ""filter bubbles"", or what the psychologist Daniel Kahneman called ""cognitive ease"" - our willingness to believe ideas that are familiar, comfortable - easy - to believe, and to avoid ideas that would take effort to accept. It's also possible to game Facebook's algorithms to manipulate public opinion, as the investigative work of journalists such as Carole Cadwalladr and Craig Silverman has shown.:But seeing a radical meme isn't enough to trigger more of the same content, it's how we interact with the content that matters to Facebook. The depth of interest needed to comment and then share a political idea will trigger more of the same and, potentially, take the user through increasing levels of radicalisation.A slightly racist granny can quickly become groomed towards adopting more radical views. Or a fellow mum be taken from conspiracy theories about the Coronavirus Act to those about Epstein's island. And then that can lead to thousands of protesters to march in London in late August against mask wearing and in defence of a ""truth"" only they are being shown. It can be tempting to dismiss the anti-mask protesters or groups marching to Buckingham Palace to #SaveOurChildren as a few thousand cranks in a sea of sensible people.

266,266,627.AmericanImmunitytoth,"Claim:Americans are immune to the Zika virus.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Several conspiracy theories were offered up around the Zika virus in 2016 as the disease spread across South America, then the rest of the world. One of the most outlandish of these rumors, the claim that Americans are immune to the virus, was posited on Twitter in May 2016:: No scientific body, whether it is from the United States or anywhere else in the world, has reached the conclusion that Americans are immune to the Zika virus (nor is there any scientific reason U.S. citizens could be immune).  In fact, the Center for Disease Control has issued a warning to any American traveling to destinations such as Mexico, Central America, or the Pacific Islands:Local mosquito transmission of Zika virus infection (Zika) has been reported in Costa Rica. Local mosquito transmission means that mosquitoes in the area are infected with Zika virus and are spreading it to people.Because Zika virus is primarily spread by mosquitoes, CDC recommends that travelers to Costa Rica protect themselves from mosquito bites. The mosquitoes that spread Zika usually do not live at elevations above 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) because of environmental conditions. Travelers whose itineraries are limited to areas above this elevation are at minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito. The following map shows areas of Costa Rica above and below 6,500 feet.* For more information, see Questions and Answers: Zika risk at high elevations.Sexual transmission of Zika virus from a male partner is also possible, so travelers are also encouraged to use condoms or not have sex.:Hundreds of people in the United States have already been infected by the disease. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 500 Americans have already contracted the disease, and researchers at the annual meeting of the Global Virus Network warned that disease will likely become a permanent part of American life, as with West Nile Virus:Once Zika virus arrives in the United States, it will be here to stay. Leading experts now predict that the mosquito-borne disease will become a constant low-level threat that Americans will need to be vaccinated against routinely--as we do now for rubella, a virus that, like Zika, causes birth defects.That is, once there is a vaccine for Zika. The earliest possible deployment of Zika vaccines could be several years away...On 24 May 2016, researchers from Johns Hopkins University, George Washington University, and the University of Georgia published a study in the scientific journal Vaccine that examined Zika-related conspiracy theories. While claims that Americans are ""immune"" to the virus were not specifically addressed, the researchers did warn that misinformation on the internet could prove to be a significant health hazard::In the new study, the research team members unearthed several unfounded Zika-related claims. Some conspiracy theorists claimed that the increase in microcephaly was caused by the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. They also insisted that drug companies were blaming Zika virus in order to earn profits from the sale of future Zika vaccines.When other people who are searching for information about Zika come across a story like this, it may lead them to avoid vaccination and distrust health authorities, the researchers concluded.""Once people have made up their minds about something, it's hard for them to change their opinions,"" said lead author Mark Dredze of Johns Hopkins. ""I'd find it surprising if this sort of story really had no impact whatsoever, and I can't imagine it would make people more likely to pursue a healthy response.""Researchers recommended taking swift action to debunk unscientific conspiracy theories around Zika and other viruses in order to make sure that future vaccine campaigns -- once the vaccine is developed -- are effective.:"
267,267,637.DidPelosiSpeaktoTrum,"Claim:Evidence gathered via Freedom of Information Act requests show a dozen calls between the cellphone of Arizona Trump supporter Ray Epps and the office of then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the week before the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Since mid-2022, social media users have repeatedly shared the claim that during the week before the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, then-U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi spoke at least a dozen times on the phone with Ray Epps, an Arizona Trump supporter some believe was a government instigator and informant in connection with that attack. :Such statements are typically accompanied by the additional claim that evidence to support it was acquired via federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. Despite the persistence of these claims, they are false. The notion that Pelosi had contact with Epps, who was captured on video urging attendees of Trump's ""Stop the Steal"" rally to march on the Capitol, is a linchpin in various conspiracy theories aimed at deflecting blame for the Jan. 6 insurrection away from Trump and his supporters to agents of the so-called ""deep state,"" of which conspiracy theorists consider Pelosi a leader. :However, no actual evidence, in the form of FOIA documents or otherwise, has ever been put forward to support the claim that Pelosi and Epps had any kind of contact. Moreover, FOIA doesn't apply to members of Congress, so no FOIA records directly applicable to Pelosi could have been obtained under the act. The claim that such records were obtained in this instance is quite simply a lie.As for Epps, he became a target of interest for conspiracy theorists hawking a ""false flag"" narrative of the Capitol attack when the Department of Justice decided not to arrest him in connection with Jan. 6 -- a decision conspiracists regarded with suspicion. But as we have previously reported, Epps' activities on that day were limited to urging Trump supporters to march peacefully from the rally to the Capitol. It doesn't appear he went into the Capitol himself or participated in any illegal activities. Nor is there evidence that he was an FBI informant or provocateur. Lastly, it makes little sense that if Pelosi and Epps were both part of a government conspiracy to mount a false flag attack on the Capitol, Pelosi would have been in direct contact with someone who played as minor a role as Epps did. The fact-checking website PolitiFact has also reported that a Pelosi spokesperson said the claim was false. :"

What the United States government did was shameful, and I am sorry.: In reality, Clinton's remarks were part of his historic official apology, made in 1997, for the Tuskegee experiment -- a 40-year government-run study of syphilis in Black men -- which is now regarded as a stark and shocking example of unethical and racist biomedical research.From the 1930s until the 1970s, hundreds of Black men in rural Alabama were told by researchers that they were being treated for syphilis, but were not in fact given any treatment, even though penicillin was widely available from the 1940s onwards. Hundreds of men died of syphilis, or from syphilis-related complications, as a direct result of this inhumane treatment.In May 1997, Clinton delivered a speech in the East Room of the White House, and issued a formal presidential apology, on behalf of the U.S. government, for the treatment of the men involved, and their families::The United States government did something that was wrong -- deeply, profoundly, morally wrong. It was an outrage to our commitment to integrity and equality for all our citizens.To the survivors, to the wives and family members, the children and the grandchildren, I say what you know: No power on Earth can give you back the lives lost, the pain suffered, the years of internal torment and anguish.

Though the practice stopped in 1960, cases of kuru were reported for years and even decades later because the disease has a long incubation period between being exposed and developing symptoms. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke notes symptoms usually include an unsteady gait, tremors, and slurred speech, as well as mood changes. There are no treatments or cures for the disease, and most infected individuals become unable to stand or eat, eventually dying while in a comatose state within six months to a year after symptoms first start to appear. :Both Hillary and Bill Clinton have long been at the center of conspiracy theories and online hoaxes for decades.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 23, 2018The ""large scale killings"" phrase included in Trump's tweet was an invocation of ""white genocide,"" a conspiracy theory popular among white supremacists who have for years been attempting to advance the baseless claim that white South African farmers are being systematically murdered en masse.The ""white genocide"" conspiracy theory is sometimes referred to as the ""Great Replacement Theory,"" as the Anti-Defamation League pointed out.It is an idea that until now has existed mainly on the fringes, fostered by proponents including white nationalist and former Klansman David Duke -- who jubilantly responded to Trump's tweet::Russia has already agreed to take in 15,000 White South Africans--your move, Mr. President.Thank you! https://t.co/gpBaU0fdhr-- David Duke (@DrDavidDuke) August 23, 2018""What particularly pleased [white supremacists like Duke] was the notion that if Trump said it, lots of conservatives would start to believe it, whereas they themselves have been having trouble getting widespread support for this notion,"" said Mark Pitcavage, senior research fellow for the ADL.Sure enough, white supremacist Richard Spencer also tweeted his support for Trump's ""opening up"" the conversation about ""the plight of White South Africans"":That said, opening up space to talk about White South Africans--giving his base the permission to seriously discuss White dispossession--is a monumental achievement.-- Richard ? Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) August 23, 2018:The ""white genocide"" claim started gaining popularity among fringe groups around 2012, according to research conducted by the ADL, who released a statement characterizing Trump's tweet as ""disturbing"":White supremacists in the United States have made such claims for years. In early 2012, ADL's Center on Extremism documented how white supremacists in the United States were gearing up for protests as part of something they termed the ""South Africa Project (SAP)."" The goal of the organizers, which included representatives from major neo-Nazi, racist skinhead, ""traditional white supremacist,"" Christian Identity groups, as well as racist prison gangs, was to stop the alleged 'genocide of Whites' in South Africa. The protests originated in 2011 at the hands of Monica Stone, a long-time member of the Louisiana-based white supremacist Christian Defense League and immigrant from South Africa.Since then, white supremacist references to ""genocide"" in South Africa have been common. Richard Spencer, for example, focused on the plight of the ""Boers"" [white settlers] in South Africa in his March speech at Michigan State University, suggesting the United States might see something similar.:That's not to say that farm attacks and farm killings do not happen in South Africa -- they do, every year. But Pitcavage pointed out that although such events are tragic and reprehensible, they have been spun into a twisted story that proponents imagine to be representative of what's in store for whites in the United States, Pitcavage said:Don't get me wrong, any death like that shouldn't happen, but it's part of the endemic problem South Africa has with violent crime with victims of all races in all of their cities. But white supremacists are not much for accurate context. They started taking these incidents and essentially built out these anecdotes into a dark fantasy of ongoing white genocide and they use that phrase over and over in South Africa. Their twisted vision is South Africa is the canary in the coal mine.Despite President Trump's directive to Secretary of State Pompeo, no evidence documents an epidemic of murders targeting white South African farmers because of their race. The number of farm murders in South Africa hit a 30-year low point in 2017-18, according to a report released by the South African Agricultural Industry (AgriSA) that cited South African police data. Overall, farm attacks have also been on a general decline after spiking in 2001-02 at 1,069, although since hitting a low point in 2013-14 that figure has been on the rise. (Recorded incidents include ""murder, rape, robbery and causing bodily harm"" and also ""all violence aimed at destroying farm infrastructure and property with a view to disrupting legitimate farming activities,"" according to AgriSA.):The AgriSA report did not account for the race of perpetrators or victims, and independent fact checking organization Africa Check reported that South African police don't track crime statistics by race. Some 19,016 killings were recorded in South Africa between April 2016 to March 2017, an increase over the previous year's number.:The most hideous cases of farm murders have, of course, drawn the most media scrutiny. Writing for the publication Quartz Africa, journalist Lynsey Chutel noted that the seclusion and perceived wealth of the farms could explain why their owners are targeted, although she noted that the brutality of some of the crimes may be attributed to racial animosity:Isolated and believed to be wealthy, South African farmers have historically been the targets of attacks in South Africa. In some cases the attacks and murders have been so brutal that many believe there is an element of race-based vengeance for apartheid. White farmers' vulnerability has increased along with the rest of the country as South Africa struggles to contain crime, especially violent crime.Kobus Visser, director of AgriSA's Rural Safety and General Affairs Chamber, also observed that:National crime statistics of the previous year show that murders in South Africa have increased for the fifth consecutive year, while robbery with aggravating circumstances, including home and business burglaries and vehicle hijackings, has also increased. The latter three, known as trio-crimes, are probably the most feared by the public and to which the farming community is exposed on an ongoing basis. The same trend was also observed with the increase in farm attacks during the past two financial years.People who live on farms in rural areas are particularly vulnerable to armed farm attacks where response times are lengthy because of the remoteness of farms. This offers the attackers an opportunity to linger on the premises for longer, with a greater chance of the victim being subjected to a high degree of violence and brutality, compared to crimes in urban areas where the police, security companies and neighbours arrive sooner to render assistance.:President Trump's remark appeared to have been inspired by a 22 August 2018 Fox News segment in which Fox News Channel host Tucker Carlson blasted a controversial initiative by the South African government to redistribute land, the vast majority of which is owned by a small white minority as a holdover of racial inequality standards that existed under apartheid. Although Carlson did not address the ""large scale killing"" of farmers in that segment, he did discuss it in May with a guest from the South African white minority lobbying group AfriForum.""Tucker Carlson is incredibly popular among white nationalists because the rhetoric and subjects of discussion on his program frequently reflect the conversations happening in the white nationalist movement,"" Jared Holt, a researcher for Right Wing Watch, told us in an email, adding:Conspiracy theories about ""white genocide"" are harmful because the people that believe them become convinced that non-white people, particularly black people and immigrants from majority-Muslim countries, are to be seen as enemies on the sole basis of their race. We have also seen ""white genocide"" conspiracy theories inspire their believers to radical violence. Dylann Roof cited ""white genocide"" in his manifesto published before he entered a predominantly black church and murdered 9 people.:"

On June 4, 2021, amid a swirl of controversy about Dr. Anthony Fauci's emails, not to mention an ongoing churn of conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green took to Twitter to demand answers from the Biden administration about the origins of the pandemic, among other questions:https://twitter.com/RepMTG/status/1400916114620702729/photo/3And yes, as one TikTok user pointed out, Greene ended her letter by urging the Biden administration to respond by June 31, 2021. A bizarre deadline, considering that date does not exist.Unanswered questions do remain about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, and plenty of distortion has been present in some sources' pursuit to politicize those questions.:In early June 2021, more than 3,000 private emails from Fauci were obtained by the Washington Post, Buzzfeed News and CNN through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. The timeframe for the emails spanned from January to June 2020 and offered a perspective into the United States' response to COVID-19 in the early days of the pandemic. A review of the emails showed correspondence between the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director and well-known public figures, including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and actor Morgan Fairchild.And what prompted controversy following the release of Fauci's correspondence was a new push by Republican leaders and conspiracy theorists that suggested content in his emails provided evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was manufactured and leaked from a lab in Wuhan, China.Also contained in the emails were communications between Fauci and an executive at the U.S.-based EcoHealth Alliance, the global nonprofit that collaborated with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and provided some funding for research at China's Wuhan Institute of Virology. As we have previously reported, misinformation peddlers like Tucker Carlson have used this connection to suggest that Fauci was ""responsible"" for the COVID-19 pandemic based, in part, on speculation that NIH-funded ""gain of function"" research efforts resulted in a manipulated form of the coronavirus ""spilling over"" from the lab.:What we do know as of this writing is that there is no evidence of wrongdoing on Fauci's behalf. Though the precise origins of the virus remain unclear, a joint investigation conducted by the World Health Organization in March found that transmission of the virus from bats to humans through another animal was the most likely scenario, and that the lab leak theory is ""extremely unlikely."" However, some political leaders have argued that the report did not adequately answer questions surrounding the origins of the virus, and U.S. President Joe Biden went as far as to order U.S. intelligence officials to ""redouble"" their efforts in finding the source of the pandemic."

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.An anti-Semitic hoax more than a century old reared its ugly head again as the Republican National Convention was underway last week.Mary Ann Mendoza, a member of the advisory board of President Trump's reelection campaign, was due to speak on Aug. 25. But she was suddenly pulled from the schedule after she had retweeted a link to a conspiracy theory about Jewish elites plotting to take over the world.In her now-deleted tweet, Mendoza urged her roughly 40,000 followers to read a lengthy thread that warned of a plan to enslave the ""goyim,"" or non-Jews. It included fevered denunciations of the historically wealthy Jewish family, the Rothschilds, as well as the top target of right-wing extremism today, the liberal Jewish philanthropist George Soros.:The thread also made reference to one of the most notorious hoaxes in modern history: ""The Protocols of the Elders of Zion."" As a scholar of American Jewish history, I know how durable this document has been as a source of the belief in Jewish conspiracies. The fact that it is still making the rounds within the fringe precincts of the political right today is testament to the longevity of this fabrication.Fake newsSurely no outright forgery in modern history has ever proved itself more durable. In the early 20th century, the Protocols were concocted by Tsarist police known as the Okhrana, drawing upon an obscure 1868 German novel, ""Biarritz,"" in which mysterious Jewish leaders meet in a Prague cemetery.This fictional cabal aspires for power over entire nations through currency manipulation and seeks ideological domination by disseminating fake news. In the novel, the Devil listens sympathetically to the reports that representatives of the tribes of Israel present, describing the havoc and subversion that they have wrought, and the destruction that is yet to come.:The Okhrana - ""protection"" in Russian - worked for what was then the most powerful anti-Semitic regime in Europe and wanted to use the hoax to discredit revolutionary forces hostile to the reactionary policies and religious mysticism of Tsarist rule.The document became a global phenomenon only about two decades after the Okhrana's fabrication. Widespread publication and republication coincided with both the influenza pandemic of 1918-20 and the aftermath of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 - both of which stirred fears of obscure forces that menaced social control.  Scapegoating Jews for disease and political unrest was nothing new. Medieval Jews had been massacred in the wake of accusations of having poisoned wells and spreading plagues. But a century ago, the crisis in public health probably mattered less than the Communists' seizure of power in Russia, which, if unchecked, might overwhelm the political order that the Great War had destabilized. That some of the revolutionary leaders were of Jewish birth seemed to reinforce the predictions of the Protocols. :Tsar Nicholas II, the last of the Romanovs, was known to have read the Protocols before being executed by the Bolsheviks in 1918. In the following year, Hitler delivered his first recorded speech, in which he depicted an international conspiracy of Jews - of all Jews - to weaken and poison the Aryan race and to extinguish German culture. Hitler himself was unsure of the authenticity of the Protocols - a question of verification that may not have mattered all that much to the Nazis. The Fuhrer told one of his early associates that the Protocols were ""immensely instructive"" in exposing what the Jews could accomplish in terms of ""political intrigue,"" and in demonstrating their skill at ""deception [and] organization."" 'Americanized' conspiracyIn the U.S., the hoax was given a wide distribution by the most admired businessman of his time: Henry Ford. By 1920, Ford had ""Americanized"" the forged document as ""The International Jew: The World's Foremost Problem."" It ran as excerpts in his newspaper, the Dearborn Independent, for 91 straight weeks. ""The International Jew"" was translated into 16 languages. :Henry Ford published anti-Semitic conspiracies.Library of CongressThough Jewish communal leadership mounted a lawsuit that forced the auto magnate to issue a retraction in 1927, the malignant hatred behind the Protocols continued to seep into the public conversation.In the 1930s, the popular anti-New Deal ""radio priest"" Charles E. Coughlin excerpted the Protocols in his newspaper, Social Justice. But Father Coughlin was wary about endorsing its accuracy, and merely stated that it might be of ""interest"" to his readers. History as conspiracyWhy is it that this demonstrably false document continues to hold sway today? Perhaps the simplest explanation is human irrationality, which neither education nor enlightenment has ever managed to defeat.:The willingness to believe in the fantasy of a surreptitious Jewish stranglehold on the international economy and on mass media also validates the insight of the Columbia University historian Richard Hofstadter. He traced in political extremism of both right and left an apocalyptic strain and a belief in an imminent confrontation between good and absolute evil.Hofstadter was well aware that conspiracies punctuate the annals of the past. But especially for those Americans who hanker for the security of a settled way of life, political paranoia is tempting, such as the belief - as Hofstadter wrote - that ""history is a conspiracy,"" in which unseen forces are the shadowy driving mechanisms of human destiny.Because anti-Semitism has survived nearly a couple of millennia, no form of prejudice has yet found a more vivid place in the imagination. And the fact that no international Jewish conspiracy was ever located has never depleted the power of the Protocols to tap into subterranean currents of demonization.From the Rothschilds to Soros:What sustains the influence of the Protocols among cranks and extremists is not the language of the text itself - which few of them are likely to have fully read in its various versions -  but what this forgery purports to underscore, which is the astonishingly cunning influence of Jews in modern history.The Protocols thus have no importance in themselves; they are spurious. But they do bestow precision upon apocalyptic fears, which could not survive without some ingredient of plausibility - however wildly far-fetched.The Rothschild family was pivotal to the emergence of finance capitalism in 19th-century Europe. The family firm had branches in Germany, France, Austria, Italy and England, which lent credence to the charge of ""cosmopolitanism"" during an era of rising nationalism. The boom-and-bust oscillations of the economy generated not only misery but also grievances against financiers who seemed to benefit from such uncertainties.  Today, Soros, a Hungarian-born, British-educated American Jew, has become an especially hated figure for the far-right. Among the world's canniest investors, he has spent billions of dollars promoting progressive causes. He seems to personify what Ford called ""the international Jew."":Venom against minorities other than Jews has not resulted in any equivalent to the Protocols. Judeophobia produced a specious documentation that bigotry against no other minority has ever elicited. Perhaps the very explicitness of the Protocols helps strengthen the suspicion that majority beliefs and interests are under attack, and keeps this dangerous form of anti-Semitism alive.:Stephen Whitfield, Professor of American Civilization, Brandeis UniversityThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

275,275,139.DisinformationandCon,"On 7 April 2018, reports began emerging from the opposition-held city of Douma east of the Syrian capital of Damascus that scores of civilians had been killed and hundreds injured in a chemical attack. In response to mounting global criticism, the Russian government, which has allied with the regime of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, ramped up its military-grade propaganda machine in an ongoing to attempt to obfuscate facts.Although no blame has yet been officially ascribed, this latest deadly attack in the now 7-year Syrian civil war is not unique in that the Assad regime has for years been condemned for using chemical weapons against civilians. In 2013 the regime was accused of using sarin, a nerve agent, in an attack that killed more than 1,400 people in Ghouta.Reports from the ground in Douma indicate there were at least two strikes, one at 4 P.M. and another at 7:30 P.M. local time. Canisters found at the scene along with symptoms exhibited by victims appear to implicate chlorine gas and ""organic phosphorus compounds in the sarin gas category."":U.S. President Donald Trump has openly blamed the Syrian regime and threatened a missile strike. After the Russians voted down a U.S.-authored United Nations Security Council resolution to investigate the attack, U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley accused the Kremlin of ""protecting a monster.""The disinformation machines have cranked up their propaganda offensive in response to criticism. Russia's state-funded networks like TASS and RT began churning out stories reflecting the government's talking points. Both outlets reported on 8 April 2018 that despite witness reports and graphic camera footage from Douma, Syrian government aid workers found ""no evidence"" of a chemical attack -- a conclusion that to no one's surprise, the Russian government corroborated:The Russian defense ministry also refuted reports that the Syrian forces had used chemical weapons in Douma in Eastern Ghouta. According to Head of the Russian Center for Reconciliation of the Warring Sides in Syria Major General Yuri Yevtushenko, the allegations that a chlorine barrel bomb had been dropped in Douma by the Syrian armed forces came from the so-called independent non-governmental organizations, including the White Helmets, which is widely known for its fake news.:The Russian embassy Twitter accounts have also revved up the obfuscation efforts:.@MoD_Russia: a fake ""chemical weapons massacre"" was a last attempt to stage a provocation for the benefit of extremists and their foreign backers. pic.twitter.com/ErHztaSEfY-- Russian Embassy, UK (@RussianEmbassy) April 12, 2018Scott Lucas, a journalist and professor of political science and international studies at the University of Birmingham, told us although Moscow became militarily involved in the Syrian conflict in 2015, they had a propaganda office at the presidential palace in Damascus since the beginning. ""From the very start you could see how they were putting out muddled story lines just to make you uncertain about what's happening,"" he told us.The White Helmets, also known by their official title Syria Civil Defense, are a non-governmental organization made up of volunteers who carry out rescue efforts in rebel-held territory while wearing small cameras. Aside from saving lives, they have been credited with documenting war crimes. Thus, they are targets of frequent (but unproven and unfounded) smears that they are terrorists who are staging ""false flag"" attacks.:Lucas told us attacking medical facilities and first responders then accusing them of terrorism is a Russian tactic, because first responders in Syria -- where it's extremely difficult and dangerous for foreign journalists to enter -- are often key reporters of atrocities:The Russians would go after hospitals and first responders and the propaganda would come out that you shouldn't trust information from White Helmets or doctors because they're aligned with the terrorists. They were deliberately bombing the area but saying you can't trust anyone who is reporting it.Official Russian government channels are not the only sources of misleading information. Lucas pointed to a coterie of Western social media personalities and bloggers who have concentrated their efforts on running interference for the Assad regime.Although their motivations are not entirely clear, they generally fall under three categories -- people who cling to what they consider anti-imperialist views and fear potential Western-led regime change in Syria, people who equate current events in Syria with the lead-up to the 2003 Iraq war, and another group of activists who, without explanation, have migrated their activism from support for Palestinians in Gaza to support for the Assad regime. :These bloggers have actively participated in campaigns to denigrate the White Helmets, even opining the rescuers are legitimate military targets.Pat Hilsman, a freelance journalist who covered the Syrian war from the ground from 2012 to 2015 for publications including the Christian Science Monitor, Vice, Middle East Eye and the Daily Beast told us although some of these bloggers may give an air to less media literate audiences of legitimacy because they have traveled to Syria to ""report"" there, they have in reality been escorted about by minders from a regime with which they are too friendly.Hilsman pointed out that real foreign journalists only cover the war at great personal risk, citing the case of Marie Colvin, a storied Sunday Times reporter who, according to recent court filings, was targeted and killed by the regime in 2012:With [the bloggers Vanessa] Beeley and [Eva] Bartlett] it's clear they've been given five-star treatment by the Syrian government and have embraced their propaganda fully without questioning it.The other important thing about Beeley and Bartlett is their entire existence is based on this false notion that no other journalist has reported from the ground. Their target is a low-information audience.:Lucas noted that there has been an overlap between pro-Assad trolling, disinformation, and propaganda and support for the regime from the American alt-right and far right. As a case in point, notorious conspiracy trolls like Alex Jones and far-right figures like white supremacist Richard Spencer were promoting claims that the Douma attack was a ""false flag,"" a common conspiracy trope positing that mass casualty incidents are engineered internally to provide pretext for either government repression or military action:Is it a coincidence that #StormyGate, #MichaelCohenRaid, #MuellerWitchHunt are all heating up at the same time as the supposed chemical attack in #Syria and the world's rush to war?-- Richard ?? Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) April 10, 2018False Flag Chemical Attack In Syria Could Start Larger War! https://t.co/wEjfyrU5Pj-- Alex Jones (@RealAlexJones) April 8, 2018:Agree or disagree but would it surprise ANYONE if our own govt (deep state) was behind these chemical attacks just to bait Trump in war w Russia?-- ??MFLYNNJR?? (@mflynnJR) April 11, 2018Hilsman pointed out that many of the same characters who regularly claim that American victims of mass shootings are nothing more than actors playing a role in a ""staged"" tragedy (as with mass shootings) repeat the same claims in response to Syrian war victims:The aftermath of the Parkland shooting is a clear example of the propaganda techniques that have been deployed against Syrian children, being deployed against American children. Perhaps the most revealing aspects of this story is the similarity of the smear campaign against Syrian civilians and the survivors of school shootings, as well as the fact that they often originate from the same sources and are spread via similar methods. In one particularly revealing example a twitter account called WhiteHelmetsExposed(@whitehelmetsEXP) which traffics in propaganda against the Syrian rescue group, has been tweeting memes claiming the Parkland Survivors are actors.:We reached out to Beeley and Bartlett for comment and got no response from Beeley. Bartlett, instead of responding, posted our query to her Twitter page and accused us of ""whitewashing al-Qaeda's rescuers."""
276,276,339.WasPopeFrancisArrest,"Claim:On Jan. 10, 2021, Italian police arrested and detained Pope Francis, on charges including possession of child pornography and human trafficking.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In January 2021, readers asked Snopes to examine the accuracy and authenticity of a widely-shared online post claiming that Italian police had arrested Pope Francis in the Vatican and charged him with child pornography, human trafficking, incest, fraud, and drug-related offenses. :On Jan. 10, Conservative Beaver, a website with a track record of publishing baseless conspiracy theories, posted an article with the headline: ""VATICAN BLACKOUT: Pope Arrested on 80 Count Indictment for Child Trafficking, Fraud.""The article reported that:Pope Francis aka Jorge Mario Bergoglio was arrested Saturday in connection with an 80- count indictment of charges including possession of child pornography, human trafficking, incest, possession of drug paraphernalia and felony fraud.The Italian National Prosecutor's Office confirmed it ordered the arrests, and filed the charges. Military officers, Italian police, and their Sex Crimes Unit went to the pope's home in the Vatican, they arrested him and several other high ranking officials, and placed them all under arrest without incident. People near the scene have reported hearing gunshots, but the Police would not confirm if they were the ones firing the weapons.Pope Francis is currently being held in an unknown prison, being interrogated by Federal Agents working for the state of Italy and Interpol. The FBI is reportedly making arrangements to fly in and interrogate him once Interpol is done with him.:The story was shared widely, especially among social media users in the United States, many of whom linked the alleged arrests to an existing, equally baseless conspiracy theory which held that shadowy figures within the Italian government -- aided and abetted by former U.S. President Barack Obama and the CIA -- somehow altered vote counts from the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential elections and fraudulently rendered Biden the winner.Claims of Pope Francis' arrest were no more than nonsensical fabrications. The article, which was published on the morning of Jan. 10, claimed that Francis was, at that time, being ""held in an unknown prison."" In reality, the pontiff made a public appearance at his official residence, the Palazzo Apostolico (Apostolic Palace) at noon Central European Standard Time, on Jan. 10 -- after Conservative Beaver posted its article. Video footage of that appearance is available here.Furthermore, the Vatican published a full schedule of completed events and meetings for Pope Francis for Jan. 11, 2021, the day after he was supposedly arrested, imprisoned, and supposedly ""interrogated by federal agents working for the state of Italy and Interpol."":Conservative Beaver's report contained a quotation attributed to Giuseppe Governale, whom they described as ""Italy's chief anti-mafia prosecutor."" From 2017 to 2020, Governale was head of Italy's Direzione Investigativa Antimafia (Anti-Mafia Investigative Directorate, or DIA). However, he no longer holds that position. The current head of the DIA (and therefore the actual current ""chief anti-Mafia prosecutor"") is Maurizio Vallone, who took office on Oct. 1, 2020.The quotation itself was also bogus, and was in fact lifted in large part from a statement provided by Kevin Turner, sheriff of Madison County, Alabama, after the arrest of Grady Paul Gaston, on Jan. 7, 2021. Below, the bogus quotation from Governale can be viewed on top, and the authentic statement of Turner can be viewed below it::The supposed list of charges against Pope Francis -- ""an 80-count indictment of charges including possession of child pornography, human trafficking, incest, possession of drug paraphernalia and felony fraud"" -- bore an uncanny similarity to the actual charges facing Gaston, as described by WHNT at the time as ""A 75-count indictment of charges including possession of child pornography, human trafficking, incest, and possession of drug paraphernalia.""So it seems that the bombshell report of Pope Francis's arrest, which prompted a wave of feverish expectation among pro-Trump conspiracy theorists, was not only entirely false, but was the result of a rather lazy replication of an easily-checked, completely unrelated crime story from Alabama, days earlier.

277,277,136.DidaFormerCanadianOf,"Claim:A former Canadian defense minister said aliens have visited earth and have technology that would solve climate change, but won't share it with humans because we are too destructive.Rating:TrueAbout this rating On 12 February 2018, multiple tabloids including the British Daily Mail published a story reporting that former Canadian defense minister Paul Hellyer said that the Illuminati were not only real but suppressing ""exotic"" technology from extraterrestrials that could solve climate change. Daily Mail reported::Paul Hellyer, who oversaw the Canadian defense forces in the 1960s, has come out and said that the illuminati is a real entity and is controlling the world - making him the highest ranking government official worldwide to do so.Hellyer told the Lazarus Effect podcast he believes the world's elite has the technology to reverse the effects of climate change, but is holding back from the public. When asked why, Hellyer said that the Illuminati wanted to help the petroleum industry.The Illuminati are a group that conspiracy theorists assert controls the world's affairs and economy, and its members come from the worlds of politics, business and entertainment.According to Hellyer, many members of the Illuminati have stakes in how well the oil industry performs financially.You wouldn't know it from the tabloid headlines, but this is hardly breaking news. Hellyer, who did serve as Canadian defense minister in the 1960s, has been on the record making these types of comments for years. In fact a simple web search of his name reveals that news stories about Hellyer's outlandish theory appear with some frequency and they rarely veer off the same theme -- aliens have visited Earth and are hiding key technology from humans because they believe we are too destructive and irresponsible. Daily Mail has previously published at least two nearly identical stories about Hellyer's alien conspiracy theory: one in 2011 and another in 2014.:Repetition doesn't make Hellyer's theories true, however, regardless of his former title. The ""Illuminati"" conspiracy theory is a long standing and pervasive yarn in which a secretive global cabal aiming to form an autocratic single world government pulls the strings and is behind basically every major event. Although the idea that aliens have visited Earth is favored among UFO enthusiasts self-proclaimed abductees, scientists haven't found evidence that intelligent extraterrestrial life exists, let alone any that have visited Earth and judged humans beneath them."
278,278,191.WasaLargeDiscShapedU,"Claim:A massive disc-shaped UFO was spotted in Malaysia.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In early September 2016, conspiracy theory and tabloid web sites began posting stories that a large disc-shaped UFO had been seen flying close to the ground in Malaysia, picking up the tale in credulous fashion:The spooky shots seem to show the object gliding just above the earth before zipping away.Seconds later, it turns on its axis and sails back for a second look - much to the amazement of gob-smacked villagers.You can see why they were so spooked as there's bright white light streaming out of the flying saucer.There's also a weird noise coming out of the UFO that sounds like a low car engine (or maybe an alien?).:The video was apparently circulated in Malaysia and created a stir among residents of Kuala Krai, the town where the object was supposedly caught on tape. But Bernama, the country's national news agency, reported that police had no reports of any such sighting.The video was apparently shared in September 2016 with the intent of making it appear as though the sighting had recently taken place in Malaysia. But the video seems to have been based on a CGI (computer-generated imagery) creation posted in 2007 by a YouTube user named Damien White, who described himself as a visual and audio artist. In the clip shown below, he explained how the images in his video were generated::"
279,279,698.SanFranciscoTechComp,"Claim:A San Francisco tech company is a front for the web site that accused Julian Assange of pedophilia.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 19 October 2016, amateur Internet sleuths on the messaging board Reddit compiled a series of happenstance facts that they believed identified a hitherto anonymous software company as a front operation for the dating web site they believe framed WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange with pedophilia.:The Reddit users launched into action over unsupported claims by a dating web site, Todd & Clare, which also goes by T&C Network Solutions, that Assange used their platform to send pornographic material to a child. Their findings were tweeted by WikiLeak's official Twitter account, and various dubious web sites posted stories claiming that the tech company, Premise, has the same address as Todd & Clare, and thus the two are one and the same. But Premise does not, in fact, share an address with the dating site. Premise CEO David Soloff told us his company was dragged into the bizarre dispute between Assange and Todd & Clare because of confusion created by a street address the company used to have:Premise is also not associated with, has never had dealings with, and has no knowledge of T&C Network Solutions. This all appears to tie back to mistaken internet information about a previous office address (645 7th St.) Premise occupied through August 2015 before we outgrew the space and moved to our current offices. We have no professional or donor affiliation with any political candidate.:A document provided by WikiLeaks on their own investigation of the dating site actually supports Soloff's statement. WikiLeaks, using the Intenet archiving tool WayBack, notes Todd & Clare were first recorded at 645 7th Street in October of 2015. It's also the first time the web site was recorded existing at its current domain, toddandclare.com.Premise moved out of that building in August of 2015, according to Soloff. Their office is now located on Berry Street -- still in San Francisco, but in a different zip code. The WayBack tool, which WikiLeaks used, shows Premise changing their address information to the location on Berry Street as of 15 July 2015, well before Todd & Clare was recorded at the 7th Street address.Redditors found pictures Soloff posted to Twitter of himself posing with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and claimed those were proof of ""ties"" between Soloff, Clinton, and Todd & Clare. Soloff's having his picture taken with Clinton is not any more proof of any substantive ""ties"" to her than any of the other thousands of pictures of people who posed for a quick photo op with the politician.:Larry Summers, who served as Treasury Secretary under President Bill Clinton, is on Premise's board of directors -- something taken as another piece of ""evidence"" that Premise is linked to the Clintons. But there's no proof that this is any more than an unsurprising coincidence, and it doesn't document any ties between the tech company and Todd & Clare.  In fact, no proof has yet been offered that the dating service which  thrust itself into international news has ties to any politician.The conspiracy arguments then got even more ridiculous:Another Redditor suggested that as the website was fake, they creators probably just chose a fake address -- and as such the real occupants of the address, Premise Data, may have nothing to do with whole episode. But what are the chances of a fake street address chosen by a fake company accidentally landing on an office with staff like those employed by Premise Data?The whole case is reminiscent of the South Park episode when the kids outsmart the FBI just by using social media. Is this the Reddit thread that uncovered a giant conspiracy to smear Assange in one of the worst possible ways?:As Premise no longer uses the address Reddit sleuths are associating with Todd & Clare, there is hardly any ""smoking gun"" to be found.  Premise moved out of the location before Todd & Clare moved in (or started using it, even if they weren't physically there).   However, the company seems to have been drawn into the strange Assange saga by the mere coincidence they were previous tenants at the address."
280,280,29.CoronavirusIsaBreedi,"This article by Daniel Jolley and Pia Lamberty is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.The novel coronavirus continues to spread around the world, with new cases being reported all the time. Spreading just as fast, it seems, are conspiracy theories that claim powerful actors are plotting something sinister to do with the virus. Our research into medical conspiracy theories shows that this has the potential to be just as dangerous for societies as the outbreak itself.One conspiracy theory proposes that the coronavirus is actually a bio-weapon engineered by the CIA as a way to wage war on China. Others are convinced that the UK and US governments introduced the coronavirus as a way to make money from a potential vaccine. Although many of these conspiracy theories seem far-fetched, the belief that evil powers are pursuing a secret plan is widespread in every society. Often these relate to health. A large 2019 YouGov poll found 16% of respondents in Spain believe that HIV was created and spread around the world on purpose by a secret group or organisation. And 27% of French and 12% of British respondents were convinced that ""the truth about the harmful effects of vaccines is being deliberately hidden from the public"".:The spread of fake news and conspiracy theories around the coronavirus is such a significant problem that the World Health Organisation (WHO) has created a ""myth busters"" webpage to try and tackle them.Spread of conspiracy theoriesResearch shows that conspiracy theories have a tendency to arise in relation to moments of crisis in society - like terrorist attacks, rapid political changes or economic crisis. Conspiracy theories bloom in periods of uncertainty and threat, where we seek to make sense of a chaotic world. These are the same conditions produced by virus outbreaks, which explains the spread of conspiracy theories in relation to coronavirus. Similar conditions occurred with the 2015-16 outbreak of Zika virus. Zika conspiracy theories proposed that the virus was a biological weapon rather than a natural occurrence. Research examining comments on Reddit during the Zika virus outbreak found conspiracy talk emerged as a way for people to cope with the extreme uncertainty they felt over Zika. :Trust in the recommendations from health professionals and organisations is an important resource for dealing with a health crisis. But people who believe in conspiracy theories generally do not trust groups they perceive as powerful, including managers, politicians and drug companies. If people do not trust, they are less likely to follow medical advice.:Researchers have shown that medical conspiracy theories have the power to increase distrust in medical authorities, which can impact people's willingness to protect themselves. People who endorse medical conspiracy theories are less likely to get vaccinated or use antibiotics and are more likely to take herbal supplements or vitamins. Plus, they are more likely to say they would trust medical advice from nonprofessionals such as friends and family. Severe consequencesIn light of these results, people who endorse conspiracy theories about the coronavirus may be less likely to follow health advice like frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap, or self-isolating after visiting at-risk areas.Instead, these people may be more likely to have negative attitudes towards prevention behaviour or use dangerous alternatives as treatments. This would increase the likelihood of the virus spreading and put more people in danger.:Already, we can see ""alternative healing approaches"" to coronavirus cropping up - some of them very dangerous. Promoters of the popular QAnon conspiracy theory, for example, have said the coronavirus was planned by the so-called ""deep state"" and claimed the virus can be warded off by drinking bleach. The spread of medical conspiracy theories can also have severe consequences for other sections of society. For example, during the Black Death in Europe, Jews were scapegoated as responsible for the pandemic. These conspiracy theories led to violent attacks and massacres of Jewish communities all over Europe. The outbreak of the coronavirus has led to a worldwide increase in racist attacks targeted towards people perceived as East Asian. It is possible to intervene and halt the spread of conspiracy theories, however. Research shows that campaigns promoting counterarguments to medical conspiracy theories are likely to have some success in rectifying conspiracy beliefs. Games such as Bad News, in which people can take the role of a fake news producer, have been shown to improve people's ability to spot and resist misinformation. :Conspiracy theories can be very harmful for society. Not only can they influence people's health choices, they can interfere with how different groups relate to each other and increase hostility and violence towards those who are perceived to be ""conspiring"". So as well as acting to combat the spread of the coronavirus, governments should also act to stop misinformation and conspiracy theories relating to the virus from getting out of hand.Daniel Jolley, Senior Lecturer in Psychology, Northumbria University, Newcastle and Pia Lamberty, PhD Researcher in Social and Legal Psychology, Johannes Gutenberg University of MainzThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

281,281,375.DidTrumpSupportersCh,"Claim:U.S. President Trump's supporters can be heard chanting ""stop the count"" in one video and ""count the vote"" in another.Rating:TrueAbout this rating Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.On the evening of Nov. 4, 2020, as election totals showed U.S. President Donald Trump trailing his opponent, Democratic candidate Joe Biden, two converging theories emerged to explain the turn of events: Too many votes were being counted (an argument that appeared to be based on unfounded accusations of voter fraud), or not enough votes were being counted (an argument apparently based on a debunked conspiracy theory about ballots being unfairly thrown out). :On social media, a video went viral that showed Trump supporters chanting ""count that vote"" in one instance and contradictory ""stop the vote"" in another. Both of these videos are real. The video on the left was taken outside of Maricopa, County, Arizona, and shows a group of Trump supporters chanting ""count the vote."" The Washington Post reported that more than 100 protesters wearing MAGA hats and draped in Trump 2020 banners congregated outside a  ballot-processing center"" to protest the election. The crowd appeared to be driven by the debunked claim that ballots marked with Sharpies were being discounted and chanted ""count the votes"" while demanding to be let into the facility::They chanted in unison, ""Count the votes!"" and ""Let us in!"" as police kept the group away from a building where officials labored for the second straight night to process ballots in Arizona's most populous county, which could sway a tight race between President Trump and former vice president Joe Biden.Many of the protesters were galvanized by an unfounded claim that swaths of pro-Trump ballots had been disqualified because voters used Sharpies to mark their choices, a rumor some dubbed ""SharpieGate."" ... Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz.) tweeted about the rumor Wednesday morning and later showed up to speak at the protest.As we reported earlier, ballots marked with Sharpies are being counted. The video on the right shows a similar protest in Detroit, Michigan. At that protest, people were upset that too many votes were being counted. Early vote totals showed Trump securing the lead in Michigan, but the results started to swing in Biden's favor as mail-in ballots started being counted, a trend that was common across many states. This led to unfounded accusations of fraud, and chants of ""stop the vote"" and ""stop the count."":PBS reported:The Detroit protests started shortly before The Associated Press declared that former Vice President Joe Biden had won Michigan.Video shot by local media showed angry people gathered outside the TCF Center and inside the lobby, with police officers lined up to keep them from entering the counting area. They chanted ""Stop the count!"" and ""Stop the vote!""Earlier, the Republican campaign filed suit in a bid to halt the count, demanding Michigan's Democratic secretary of state allow in more inspectors. Trump has repeatedly insisted without evidence that there are major problems with the voting and the counting.Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, insisted both parties and the public had been given access to the tallying ""using a robust system of checks and balances to ensure that all ballots are counted fairly and accurately.""The 2020 presidential election has been bombarded with misinformation.

282,282,502.HowDidHunterBidensLa,"With just over two weeks to go until the 2020 U.S. presidential election, the New York Post published a story that was lauded by right-leaning media and political figures as a ""bombshell"" and criticized by others as disinformation resurfacing an old method of political attack.The story was based around contents found on the hard drive of a laptop that had allegedly belonged to Hunter Biden, the son of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. Citing emails found on the hard drive, the Post reported it had a ""smoking gun"" proving that the elder Biden had met with a Ukrainian energy firm executive while Hunter sat on the board of that firm.The Post claimed to have confirmed a long-running line of political attack against Biden -- namely that Biden had used his position as vice president in the Obama administration to benefit Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company, while his son sat on the board.However, the Post's ""smoking gun"" email doesn't prove that Biden met with the Burisma executive on behalf of his son, and Biden's campaign has denied any such meeting ever took place. Many noted that the story raised more questions than it answered.:Below, we unpack what we know.The New York Post's StoryOn Oct. 14, 2020, The New York Post published a story headline that read, ""Smoking-gun email reveals how Hunter Biden introduced Ukrainian businessman to VP dad."" The Post reported that Rudy Giuliani, the personal attorney for U.S. President Donald Trump (who is running against Joe Biden), gave them a ""copy"" of Hunter Biden's laptop drive on Oct. 11, 2020. The newspaper was first alerted to its existence by Steve Bannon, a former Trump aide and former Breitbart News executive.The ""smoking gun"" message is embedded in the story. It was allegedly sent by Burisma board adviser Vadym Pozharskyi in April 2015, and read, ""Dear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together. It's realty [sic] an honor and pleasure."":The story didn't offer any other evidence that a meeting between Joe Biden and Pozharskyi ever took place, and the Biden campaign responded by stating that it did not. A Biden campaign spokesman told the New York Times, ""We have reviewed Joe Biden's official schedules from the time and no meeting, as alleged by the New York Post, ever took place.""The spokesman also stated the Post had never contacted them about ""critical elements of the story.""The Post story contained a second email, allegedly sent by Pozharskyi in 2014, addressed to both Hunter Biden and Devon Archer, who was also on the Burisma board. In the message, Pozharskyi was seeking ""advice"" from the men as to ""how you could use your influence"" to help the company in a matter described as various Ukrainian government agencies attempting extract money from the company. It didn't specifically ask Biden to seek help from his father, the American vice president.Aside from those emails, the story included embedded images from Hunter Biden's alleged computer hard drive which include family photographs and screen shots from a lurid video involving the younger Biden.:It also contained an image of a December 2019 subpoena for a MacBook Pro and a hard drive.The story prompted immediate scrutiny and criticism for its timing and sourcing, dropping just over two weeks before the presidential election in which Biden is Trump's challenger, and sourced from Trump allies.It also raised questions about whether the emails, upon which the story's entire premise is based, were real. Some even questioned whether the laptop itself actually belonged to Hunter Biden.We reached out to the Biden campaign and Hunter Biden's attorney, George Mesires, with questions about the story but didn't hear back in time for publication.The story also raised red flags for disinformation researchers.For example, Thomas Rid, a professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies, tweeted that the story should be approached with caution, and noted that it's an ""old Cold War disinformation tactic to pass information, especially but not exclusively when forged, to low-brow newspapers that have high circulation and low standards of investigation. Ideal for surfacing and amplification."":On March 16, 2022, a New York Times story about a U.S. Department of Justice into Hunter Biden's tax affairs, the Times mentioned emails ""from a cache of files that appears to have come from a laptop abandoned by Mr. Biden in a Delaware repair shop. The email and others in the cache were authenticated by people familiar with them and with the investigation.""The Chain of EventsThe Post reported that the saga started in April 2019, when a man identifying himself as Hunter Biden dropped the laptop off at a computer repair shop in the Biden family's home state of Delaware. The laptop had been damaged by water.Although the Post didn't identify the shop owner, journalists were able to track the shop down because the Post failed to remove metadata from images embedded in the story. The shop owner, John Paul Mac Isaac, spoke to several reporters in a nearly hour-long conversation recorded by The Daily Beast.:In the discussion, Mac Isaac alleged that a man identifying himself as Hunter Biden had dropped the laptop in question off with liquid damage. He also said he didn't actually see the vice president's son dropping the laptop off. The Post story contained an invoice naming Hunter Biden.Mac Isaac declined to answer many questions, but he did state that the contents of the laptop troubled him. Mac Isaac referenced the debunked Seth Rich conspiracy theory, which holds that Rich, a DNC staffer, was murdered by Democratic political operatives after he hacked the DNC's server. Mac Isaac claimed he was fearful for his own safety.U.S. Intelligence officials have concluded that it was Russian government agents, not Rich, who hacked the DNC. The Russian government had actively promoted the Seth Rich conspiracy theory, as had right-wing media and social media personalities.Mac Isaac said he was troubled by the contents of the laptop, and was therefore in contact with the FBI -- although he gave contradictory statements as to who initiated the contact. According to the subpoena published by the Post, the FBI took the laptop from Mac Isaac in December 2019.:We left a voice message with Mac Isaac's computer shop but didn't get a response in time for publication. We also reached out to the FBI with questions about the claims in the story and Mac Isaac's statement, but the FBI replied that according to policy, it wouldn't confirm or deny an investigation.The Post reported that before Mac Isaac gave the laptop and hard drive to the FBI, he ""made a copy of the hard drive and later gave it to former Mayor Rudy Giuliani's lawyer, Robert Costello.""When reached by phone, Costello told Snopes that he was given the contents of the hard drive in September 2020. The contents, he said, contain thousands of emails, text messages, pictures and videos.Costello told Snopes that the reason his client, Giuliani, ultimately gave the hard drive copy to the Post was because that's what its source (although Costello didn't name him, we presume based on Mac Isaac's own statements that he was the source) wanted done.:""We turned [the hard drive contents] over [to the Post] because the intent of the source was to get the hard drive to Rudy Giuliani so he could do something with it, bring it to the public's attention,"" Costello said.Costello said it was ""reasonable"" to assume Mac Isaac wanted the hard drive's contents given to the Post because he was frustrated by his perceived lack of law enforcement action by the FBI, who had possessed the laptop since December 2019. Costello said the laptop's original owner never retrieved his property, therefore it was ""considered abandoned property"" that ""became the property of the source.""Both Facebook and Twitter took action against the Post article, with Twitter blocking users from posting links to it. Twitter said it did so because the story included personal and private information, and its content violated Twitter's policy against posting hacked material.""We don't want to incentivize hacking by allowing Twitter to be used as distribution for possibly illegally obtained materials,"" the platform stated.:A Facebook executive said their company suppressed the distribution of the story on its platform to stem the spread of misinformation, pending review by Facebook's fact-checking partners.The platforms' actions prompted a rebuke from Trump.""So terrible that Facebook and Twitter took down the story of 'Smoking Gun' emails related to Sleepy Joe Biden and his son, Hunter,"" Trump tweeted. ""It is only the beginning for them. There is nothing worse than a corrupt politician.""An Old Political AttackThe New York Post story played on an allegation originally raised to counter those made against Trump in an impeachment inquiry.Trump was accused of attempting to strong-arm Ukraine's president into producing damaging information on Biden by withholding crucial military aid. Trump was ultimately impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives, but the Republican-controlled Senate voted acquit him without calling witnesses or admitting new evidence. Trump and his supporters countered by turning Ukraine corruption allegations on Biden, stating that as vice president, Biden had pressured the Ukrainian government to fire a prosecutor so the prosecutor couldn't investigate Burisma while his son sat on the company's board.:The New York Post article resurfaced a 2018 statement made by Biden which has been widely taken out of context to show ""proof"" of that corruption: ""I looked at them and said: I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money,"" Biden stated. ""Well, son of a bitch. He got fired.""Biden wasn't admitting to pressuring Ukraine to fire a prosecutor looking into his son's firm, however. He was describing efforts by the Obama administration to stamp out government corruption in Ukraine, which included getting rid of an ineffective prosecutor. An investigation by Senate Republicans into Biden's activities as vice president in relation to Ukraine concluded in 2020 without finding any evidence of wrongdoing.Since we published this story, many Snopes readers have inquired whether a photograph included in the Post story truly showed Hunter Biden asleep with a ""crack pipe"" dangling from his mouth. At this time we know nothing about the provenance of the photograph: Who took it, whether it was real or staged, whether it was taken with or without Biden's knowledge, whether Biden was truly asleep, or whether he had been smoking crack (or anything else) with the pictured pipe. We also note that the image only shows part of the person's face alleged to be Hunter Biden.:We sent questions to the Post's editors asking how the Post verified the authenticity of the hard drive's contents and why it included personal images from it which were not pertinent to the story. We will update if we hear back."

And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. :In March 2020, social media users started sharing clips from the 2018 South Korean television show ""My Secret Terrius,"" which supposedly showed characters using the word ""coronavirus."" This is a real scene from a 2018 show. But while many people may have only heard the word ""coronavirus"" for the first time in 2020, it has been around for decades.:Scientists first identified human coronaviruses in humans in the 1960s. Since then, we've seen a few coronavirus outbreaks, such as the MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) outbreak in 2012 and the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak in 2002. In a longer version of this clip, the TV doctor explains how these diseases all come from the same group of viruses:The fictional coronavirus in the show is also rather different from the strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) that was spreading around the globe in early 2020. In the show, someone ""tweaked"" the virus in order to make it more deadly. In reality, that simply isn't possible. COVID-19 is not a human-made bioweapon. (You can read about that conspiracy theory's origins and scientific failings here.):The coronavirus in the show also has a 90% mortality rate. While we still have a lot to learn about COVID-19, the disease does not have a 90% mortality rate. The case fatality rate differs from country to country and can be influenced by various factors, such as the availability of supplies at hospitals. In places like Italy, where the outbreak has been severe, the fatality rate has climbed as high as 11%. In places like South Korea, where outbreaks were mitigated with a massive testing program, the fatality rate has been just over 1%. We should also note that some social media users shared clips of ""My Secret Terrius"" along with the claim that this was a ""Chinese"" show. While that may play into the human-made bioweapon conspiracy theory (again, that is a false rumor), this show actually comes from South Korea. In short: A 2018 show South Korean show called ""My Secret Terrius"" does mention the word ""coronavirus."" However, this term predates the show by several decades. Furthermore, the fictional virus does not share the same traits as the strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) that was spreading around the world in early 2020. :In other words, while COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus, not all coronaviruses cause COVID-19.

284,284,93.WhatIstheBirdsArentR,"If you use the internet, there's a good chance you've happened upon mention of a bizarre conspiracy theory known as Birds Aren't Real. And if you've tried to figure out what it is, you've probably come across videos of people carrying anti-bird signage who appear to be not just convinced, but passionate about the idea that birds are not just fake, they're a shady government plot.So what is it? Is it a conspiracy theory or is it a joke? That seems to be the question surrounding the so-called Birds Aren't Real movement.:""Is this movement a real thing or a hoax?"" one Snopes reader asked.""I'd love to know if it's satire or if these people are actually that deluded,"" another reader inquired.The Birds Aren't Real movement was probably best described in 2018 by journalist Rachel Roberts as ""a joke that thousands of people are in on."" What makes it unique is that it was built from the ground up.We'll explain what we've learned about it below.Is It Satire?Based on our review of social media accounts and various analyses of Birds Aren't Real, it seems safe to say that the movement is satire that skewers real conspiracy movements that are built on similarly far-fetched beliefs. But it also captures the zeitgeist of Gen Z, who have grown up in a social-media-driven information ecosystem, in which facts have become partisan footballs.:Evidencing the movement's satirical motives, the Daily Beast dug up a Facebook post from the movement's founder, Peter McIndoe, who in 2017 posted, ""i made a satirical movement a few months ago, and people on instagram seem to like it a lot. now there's a facebook so the moms of the current 'bird truthers' can be in on it too.""Since then, McIndoe has changed gears. He now publicly commits fully to his character, a man who fervently believes birds are government spy-drones and travels the country spreading his message. Present-day McIndoe, thus, claimed it was a staffer who wrote that post, and that staffer has since been removed.Administrators for the Ohio and the New York chapters of Birds Aren't Real flat out told the Daily Beast the movement is, in the words of Birds Aren't Real Ohio, a ""satirical approach to counteracting such far-fetched conspiracies (such as flat earthers).""When asked about news articles that describe the movement as satirical, McIndoe told Snopes by email, ""Our movement has been co-opted by internet trolls and people out to delegitimize us. While there are many satirical jokes made on the internet about us, we are not satirical and consider this labeling harmful to our cause."":Is the Satire Actually Funny?McIndoe impressively commits to the bit while out in public, and his videos are legitimately funny. He turns up at actual protests, or simply in rush hour traffic, carrying signs that bear messages like ""PIGEONS ARE LIARS"" and throwing off one-liners like, ""Your filming me doesn't scare me, the birds do that to me every day anyway!"":The Birds Aren't Real videos are the type of irreverent, outlandish guerrilla comedy made popular among young audiences by the likes of Eric Andre, and sometimes show McIndoe using the movement's batty logic to talk his way out of precarious situations:As part of his persona, McIndoe leverages the news media's penchant for doing ""both sides"" coverage, which is often prevalent on issues that don't have two legitimate ""sides"" -- a phenomenon critics refer to as false balance. When asked during an interview with Memphis TV news station WREG whether his movement was satirical, he claimed to be offended by the question.:""I don't think you would say that if I said, birds are real, you know,"" McIndoe stated. ""I don't know why the other side of the argument can't be treated with equal respect.""So, What Is This Thing All About?The narrative behind the Birds Aren't Real movement, as the website states, is that decades ago, all birds in the U.S. were killed by the CIA and replaced with spy drones in an operation called ""Very Large Bird"" -- so named because the CIA didn't want to get into copyright trouble with the ""Sesame Street"" character Big Bird. Merchandise sold on the movement's website is hilariously consistent with that theme.If you ask McIndoe when the movement started, he will tell you it was started in 1976 with a partnership between animal rights and anti-surveillance activists, when the bird-drone program was leaked to the public.:In reality, Birds Aren't Real burst onto the scene in 2017. McIndoe told us that although Birds Aren't Real members were attending other demonstrations at that time, but the Women's March in Memphis, Tennessee, in 2017 was the first time it got the attention of the internet.Hill, the student magazine for McIndoe's alma mater, the University of Arkansas, ran a detailed profile of the movement's beginnings, describing how McIndoe and a group of friends spontaneously chose that protest for a Birds Aren't Real ""demonstration"" of their own:""I'd always wanted to go to a rally and hold up a poster that had nothing to do with what the rally was about,"" McIndoe told journalist Roberts.The magazine described how, three months after the Women's March, McIndoe began creating social media accounts for the movement, and as it gained traction, so did the demand for merchandise, at which time McIndoe and his friend Ray Schillawski realized there was business potential behind the meme.:In his email to Snopes, McIndoe said he is currently living on the road in his van emblazoned with the Birds Aren't Real logo. He said he attended the University of Arkansas for two years, majoring in psychology, but dropped out in 2018 to be the full-time spokesman for the Birds Aren't Real movement.To date, McIndoe said there are about 50 Birds Aren't Real chapters in the U.S., while there have been about 30 in-person gatherings, which have comprised rallies, seminars and protests. The events are attended by an average of 150 people.In the 2018 interview with Roberts, McIndoe explained that many have attempted to apply their own ideological lens to the movement when trying to interpret what exactly it pokes fun at. But he pointed to a bigger picture:""It's about the ideology and this crazed era that we're experiencing, and it seems so surreal,"" he is quoted saying. ""I'm trying to capture that same sense of surrealness in my videos by blending fiction and reality."":Based on the readers asking us what's real and what's fiction about the movement, it appears McIndoe has succeeded."

286,286,58.RepSheilaJacksonLees,"Amid a rancorous Senate Judiciary Committee hearing about sexual assault allegation leveled against U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, conspiratorial social media users interpreted the handing of an envelope by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) to attorneys representing accuser Christine Blasey Ford that was caught on camera as nefarious:During emotional, hours-long testimonies on 27 September 2018, Ford described to the Senate Judiciary Committee details of her accusation that Kavanaugh attempted to rape her during a party when the two were in high school in Maryland, leaving psychological scars. When it came Kavanaugh's turn, the circuit judge adamantly denied any allegations of sexual misconduct that had been raised in the prior week. Although Kavanaugh's confirmation process been controversial they took a turn for chaotic after three women including Ford accused him of sexual abuse during his high school and college years.:Proceedings have also taken a turn towards the conspiratorial, with Kavanaugh's supporters claiming the women accusing him are part of a left wing plot to discredit him (and Kavanaugh himself said as much during his opening statements).Ford has been falsely linked with billionaire philanthropist George Soros and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, the subjects of many a right-wing conspiracy theory. So it should come as no surprise that many automatically assumed the envelope Jackson Lee handed to Ford's lawyers contained money from Soros, for example::The paranoid fixation with the contents of the envelope was no doubt ginned up by right-wing commentators who are hardly shy about letting their followers use their imaginations to fill in the blanks left by their vague statements. ""I'm going to need someone to explain this to me, because it's basically the shadiest thing in the history of ever,"" opined the Chicks on the Right, while others intoned that the envelope merited the attention of federal investigators:The FBI is rumored to be investigating what was in the package Sheila Jackson Lee surreptitiously slipped Mrs. Ford's lawyer, Michael Bromich, after her furtive glances.

The envelope contained notes to Ford from women outside the hearing room who were unable to be seated inside during her testimony, Jackson Lee's spokesperson Robin Chand told us in an email, ""Simply, what was passed were unopened stationery notes to counsel for Dr. Ford from women who wanted to enter the hearing room but were not allowed to enter the hearing room."":"
287,287,539.DidtheWhiteHouseWatc,"Claim:Top Obama administration officials watched the Benghazi attack unfold in real-time but did nothing to intervene.Rating:FalseAbout this rating One of the more common fault-finding rumors associated with the 11 September 2012 attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, is that Obama administration officials sat around watching the attack unfold in real time (via video) but did nothing to intervene.  The earliest expression of this claim we've found comes from a 24 October 2012 opinion piece published by Forbes magazine::Just one hour after the seven-hour-long terrorist attacks upon the U.S. consulate in Benghazi began, our commander-in-chief, vice president, secretary of defense and their national security team gathered together in the Oval Office listening to phone calls from American defenders desperately under siege and watching real-time video of developments from a drone circling over the site.  Yet they sent no military aid that might have intervened in time to save lives.Even at the time it was written, that claim was highly questionable for presenting a distorted version of what the sources it referenced (CBS News and ABC News) actually reported. A CBS News story published the same day as the Forbes piece stated the following:CBS News correspondent Margaret Brennan reports that the FBI and State Department have reviewed video from security cameras that captured the attack on the consulate. The audio feed of the attack was being monitored in real time in Washington by diplomatic security official Charlene Lamb. CBS News has learned that video of the assault was recovered 20 days later from the more than 10 security cameras at the compound. The government security camera footage of the attack was in the possession of local Libyans until the week of Oct. 1. The video will be among the evidence that the State Department's review board will analyze to determine who carried out the assault.:In other words, it was not the case that President Obama, Vice President Biden, Secretary of Defense Panetta, and a national security team were ""watching real-time video of developments from a drone circling over the site""; rather, a single diplomatic security official was listening to an audio feed of events in Benghazi. Security cameras in the U.S. consulate compound did record video of the events as they unfolded, and a U.S. surveillance drone camera did capture the last hour of the attack, but neither of those sources was watched real-time by officials in Washington, as the consulate video recordings were not recovered until weeks after the attack:Video footage from the United States consulate in Benghazi, Libya, taken the night of the Sept. 11 anniversary attacks, shows an organized group of armed men attacking the compound, according to two U.S. intelligence officials who have seen the footage and are involved in the ongoing investigation. The footage, which was recovered from the site [during the first week of October] by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, offers some of the most tangible evidence yet that a military-style assault took place, according to these officials. The Obama administration has been studying the videos, taken from closed-circuit cameras throughout the Benghazi consulate's four-building compound, for clues about who was responsible for the attack and how it played out. The two officials [said] that analysts are hoping to decipher the faces of the attackers and match them up with known jihadists. In addition to the footage from the consulate cameras, the U.S. government is also poring over video taken from an overhead U.S. surveillance drone that arrived for the final hour of the night battle at the consulate compound and nearby annex.:Moreover, the majority report issued by the House Select Committee on Benghazi plainly stated that, minutes after learning about the ongoing attack at the U.S. diplomatic compound, President Obama and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta issued ""clear orders to deploy military assets"":Just minutes after word of the attack reached the Secretary, he and General Martin E. Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, departed the Pentagon to attend a previously scheduled 5:00 p.m. meeting at the White House with President Obama and National Security Advisor Thomas E. Donilon. The Secretary recalled two details about the attack on the U.S. facility in Benghazi: a building was on fire and Stevens was missing.  As the Secretary and Dempsey briefed the President on the evolving situation in Benghazi, Libya, the Secretary recalls the following guidance:The President made clear that we ought to use all of the resources at our disposal to try to make sure we did everything possible to try to save lives there.Similarly, the Secretary insists his own intentions and actions that night, in the aftermath of the President's orders, were also clear: deploy the identified assets immediately. The Secretary said his orders were active tense. ""My orders were to deploy those forces, period ... [I]t was very clear: They are to deploy."" He did not order the preparation to deploy or the planning to deploy or the contemplation of deployment. His unequivocal testimony was that he ordered the identified assets to ""deploy."":After the release of the Select Committee's report, Charles Lane caustically observed in a  Washington Post opinion piece that:Within 90 minutes of the Sept. 11, 2012, surprise attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound that killed Ambassador J.  Christopher Stevens and an aide, the report tells us, Obama had told his secretary of defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to do everything possible, implicitly including using military force, to protect Americans.These were ""very clear directions,"" according to Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), one of Obama's harshest critics on the panel.How different from the version of the president's conduct propounded on right-wing talk radio and TV in the aftermath: that he and his aides coolly watched live video of the mayhem in Benghazi, supplied by drones flying overhead, but declined to order a rescue mission.Not only does this new Republican report debunk that smear, but it actually shifts blame from Obama to ""a rusty bureaucratic process not in keeping with the gravity and urgency of the events happening on the ground."" A second attack, on a separate CIA annex, in which security contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty died, was already over by the time U.S. military assets started moving toward Libya. And even then, the forces headed to the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli, not Benghazi.:To be sure, the report strains to put the most negative construction on these previously reported delays, insinuating but not asserting that Woods and Doherty might have been saved but for the low alert status of U.S. forces overseas or the dithering of officials in Washington. And it's true: Special units in Europe did not meet their own standards for rapid deployment to Tripoli.After two years of investigation, however, such tendentious implications are all that remain of the conspiracy theory that the Obama administration told rescuers to ""stand down"" or otherwise deliberately abandoned Americans on the ground."
288,288,5.AretheCrewoftheExplo,"Claim:The seven astronauts supposedly killed in the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger explosion are quietly living out their lives in the U.S.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On the morning of 28 January 1986, NASA lost its first astronauts to an in-space accident when all seven members of the Space Shuttle Challenger crew were lost when a booster engine failed and caused the Challenger to break apart just 73 seconds after launch. Killed in that accident were Teacher-in-Space payload specialist Sharon Christa McAuliffe; payload specialist Gregory Jarvis; and astronauts Judith A. Resnik, mission specialist; Francis R. (Dick) Scobee, mission commander; Ronald E. McNair, mission specialist; Mike J. Smith, pilot; and Ellison S. Onizuka, mission specialist.:Nearly thirty years later, in May 2015, the online world contemplated a conspiracy rumor questioning whether the Challenger crew was in fact still alive, as evidenced by the fact that persons resembling those original crew members (at the approximate ages they would be now), and bearing similar or identical names, are still living and working in the United States:What if I were to tell you that most, if not all, of Challenger's 7 crew members are still alive and thriving in their new professions, contrary to what we've been told? : It's one thing that one of the Challenger's crew members resembles someone alive today. For that, we can chalk it up to a coincidence.Ita??s another thing entirely that SIX members of the Challenger crew have doppelgA$?ngers who are alive, in some cases with exactly the same names (Richard Scobee, Michael J. Smith, Judith Resnick, Sharon McAuliffe). What are the chances of that?You don't have to be an expert in mathematics to know that those odds defy statistical probability.This exercise is an amusing example of how easy it is to weave a compelling conspiracy theory out of a few suggestive elements, but its premise defies credulity: NASA faked (for no explicable reason) the deaths of seven astronauts in a catostrophic shuttle accident, then allowed those astronauts to openly live out the rest of their lives back home without even taking the basic steps of disguising their physical appearances or real names -- and nobody noticed it until nearly 30 years later.:All this conspiracy exercise really demonstrates is that you can sometimes find two people with the same name who bear a passing resemblance to each other. To wit:Born on May 19, 1939, Commander Francis Richard Scobee was 46 when he died in the Challenger explosion. He would be 75 years old if he were alive today.Strangely, there's a man also named Richard Scobee, the CEO of a Chicago marketing-advertising company called Cows in Trees, who bears a striking resemblance (factoring in the 30-year timelapse) to Commander Richard Scobee -- same high forehead, same eyebrows, same wide-set eyes that are slightly tilted down in their outer corners. : These two Scobees are similar in appearance, but there are distinct differences that can't be accounted for by the passage of years (such as the difference in ear shapes). Moreover, at the time that Francis Richard Scobee, the former Air Force pilot, was training with NASA as an astronaut and serving as an instructor pilot for the shuttle's 747 carrier aircraft, Richard Scobee, the current CEO of Cows in Trees, was serving as CEO and President of The Marketing Edge, Inc. in Chicago. The same man couldn't have been holding down two such disparate jobs, in two widely separated geographic locations, at the same time.Born on Oct. 21, 1950, Challenger's mission specialist Ronald McNair, the second African-American astronaut, with a Ph.D. in physics, would be 64 years old if he had not perished in the space shuttle explosion. If Ronald (l) were still alive today, he would look just like this pic of his brother, Carl (r). :Yes, the late Ronald McNair looked a lot like his brother, Carl, as many siblings do (but they're still easy to tell apart, as Carl has an obvious gap in his front teeth that Ronald didn't). And this proves what, exactly? It might be a curiosity if there were no record of the existence of ""Carl McNair"" until after the Challenger explosion, but that isn't the case. Are we supposed to believe that Ronald secretly took over his brother's identity after the Challenger ""accident"" and somehow engineered the disappearance of the real Carl? Of course, the real point of this comparison is that the creators of this conspiracy theory couldn't find a similarly named doppelganger for Ronald McNair other than his own brother.Another Challenger mission specialist, Ellison Onizuka, the first Japanese-American astronaut, also has a lookalike brother named Claude. Born on June 24, 1946 in Hawaii, Ellison would be 68 years old today if he had not died in the Challenger explosion. If Ellison were still alive, he would look just like this pic of his younger brother Claude -- same eyebrows, same eyes, same crow's feet wrinkles, same nose, even the same hair-parting. : Again, the shocking revelation that someone looked a lot like his brother. And again, the creators of this theory couldn't find a similarly named doppelganger for one of the Challenger astronauts other than his own brother.:  :And now we pause for a pertinent question: Why has Gregory Jarvis been completely skipped over in this accounting of dead Challenger astronauts who are seemingly carrying on today as if nothing had ever happened to them? The simple answer is that it's because someone couldn't find any online photographs of another Gregory Jarvis who credibly resembles payload specialist Gregory Jarvis.Born on April 5, 1949, Challenger mission specialist Judith Arlene Resnik, with a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, was the first Jewish American astronaut to go into space and the second female American astronaut. She would be 66 years old today if she had not died in the explosion.If she were alive today, it is not difficult to imagine that after 29 years, astronaut Judith Resnik would look like Arthur Liman Professor of Law Judith Resnik at Yale Law School -- dark curly hair, dark eyes, same eyebrow shape, same lines on both sides of the face extending up from the jaw. : Nobody familiar with either person would confuse these two Judith Resniks with each other, as they have very different facial structures. And while Judith Resnik the electrical engineer was engaged in work and study at RCA, NIH, Xerox, and NASA in the 1970s and 80s, Judith Resnik the lawyer was teaching law school classes at Yale and USC. How someone could have been simultaneously (not to mention secretly) holding down two completely disparate jobs at opposite ends of the country remains unexplained.Born on Sept. 2, 1948, Sharon Christa McAuliffe was a social studies teacher at Concord High School in New Hampshire when she was selected from more than 11,000 applicants to participate in the NASA Teacher in Space Project. If Challenger had not exploded, she would be the first teacher in space. If she had not died in the Challenger disaster, McAuliffe would be 66 years old today.Well, there's a Sharon A. McAuliffe, an adjunct professor at Syracuse University College of Law, who kinda looks like an older astronaut McAuliffe, factoring in the 30 years timelapse. Look at the cowlick of hair, sweeping from the center of their hairlines to the left side of their foreheads.: : Same problems: These two Sharon McAuliffes don't really look all that much alike, and while Christa McAuliffe (she went by her middle name rather than ""Sharon"") the schoolteacher was obtaining degrees in education from Framingham State College (Massachusetts) and Bowie State University (Maryland), teaching social studies at Concord High School (New Hampshire), and training with NASA, Sharon McAuliffe the lawyer was attending Syracuse University and working for an accounting firm in Syracuse (New York).This conspiracy narrative concludes by claiming that there are no records in the Social Security Death Index (SSDI) for any of the seven Challenger astronauts:There is no Social Security Death Index for all 7 Challenger crew members. As far as Social Security is concerned, Francis Richard Scobee, Michael J. Smith, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Judith Resnik, Greg Jarvis, and Sharon Christa McAuliffe are still alive.:First of all, the SSDI is not comprehensive: That database indexes most &mdash but not all -- persons who have died since 1936, had a Social Security Number (SSN), and whose death has been reported to the Social Security Administration. More important, this claim about missing records is not true: entries for at least four of the Challenger crewmembers can easily be found in SSDI searches: :    :  : All in all, we have four Challenger astronauts who looked somewhat like persons with similar names who are living today, two Challenger astronauts who looked like their siblings, and one Challenger astronaut who apparently didn't look like anyone else bearing the same name. This conspiracy rumor about still-living ""dead"" Challenger astronauts is some good tongue-in-cheek fun, but as an actual theory it's sorely lacking in evidence and cohesiveness."
289,289,370.DidaWomanAdmitSheWas,"Claim:A Hollywood insider revealed that Bill Cosby was framed with rape allegations to prevent him from buying the television network NBC.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In April 2018, American comedian and actor Bill Cosby was convicted of felony sexual assault on a woman who had accused him of drugging and sexually abusing her years before (one of dozens who made similar allegations). Cosby was sentenced to three to 10 years in a state prison and is currently serving time. He has consistently denied the accusations.:The case became the subject of viral conjecture in late February 2019, when social media users shared an article published by the South African website Abesiki Bebunda Newspaper headlined ""Woman Admits She Was Paid to Frame Cosby with Rape.""The article, credited to ""Baxter Dmitry,"" didn't actually cite any of Cosby's accusers. Instead, it recited an elaborate conspiracy theory, attributed to a so-called ""Hollywood insider,"" that multiple accusers were paid to frame the actor:It is a crime to be black, successful and rich. A Hollywood insider has come forward alleging that Bill Cosby was framed with rape allegations in order to prevent him from buying TV network NBC ...Cosby, known as ""America's Dad"", is standing trial for aggravated sexual assault in Pittsburgh, and has responded to allegations that he drugged and sexually abused women with fierce denials.The Hollywood insider says that Bill Cosby became such a threat to the establishment elite that they had to invent the vilest of accusations against him in order to destroy his career.The accusers are women who have worked with the Illuminati in the past and were paid to state they are victims of rape. Only one of Cosby's accusers leveled accusations against him within the statute of limitations (twelve years), and the others, according to the Hollywood insider, are opportunists who have been paid off to smear Cosby's reputation and destroy his career.:The supposed ""insider"" was not named in the article. Moreover, despite being published in 2019, the content appeared outdated, stating, for example, that Cosby ""is standing trial for aggravated sexual assault in Pittsburgh.""In the process of trying to corroborate the text, we discovered it had been published several times before by assorted junk news websites, including News Punch (14 June 2017 and 3 August 2016), Your News Wire (3 August 2016), SplenGroup (29 January 2016), and a fake TMZ website using the now-defunct domain name TMZNewsOnline.net (on or about 26 January 2016).We had occasion to debunk a previous hoax story by TMZNewsOnline.net in July 2016, when the website falsely claimed that pro wrestler John Cena had died in a car crash. Your News Wire published dozens of questionable items that came across our transom between 2015 and 2018, after which it continued publishing the same false and misleading, conspiracy-tinged content under the name News Punch.Even ignoring its sordid provenance, the article is utterly lacking in credibility. The vaunted ""Hollywood insider"" who supposedly provided the information was not named. The group alleged to be behind the plot to frame Cosby, a secret society of elites called the ""Illuminati,"" is a standard (and long discredited) trope resorted to by conspiracy theorists who have no evidence to support their claims.:It is true that Bill Cosby was once reportedly interested in buying NBC from then-owner General Electric in the early 1990s (in fact, a sentence in the junk news article was copied and pasted verbatim from a New York Times report on the nascent Cosby/NBC deal published in 1992), but that was more than a decade before the first sexual assault allegation came to light. (The notion that an effort by Hollywood elites to frame Cosby was prompted by his attempt to purchase the network was first promulgated by the late comedian and noted conspiracy theorist Dick Gregory in 2015.)The supposed ""testimony"" of an anonymous person who claimed to be a former Wilhelmina model and said she was paid $15,000 to ""seduce and destroy Bill Cosby"" was published on a website in 2014. That website, which claimed it had ""fact checked and verified"" the statement, no longer exists. We encountered no other evidence to support the claims."
290,290,403.DoesGeorgiaHaveNoWay,"Claim:Georgia has ""no way to verify"" its 2020 presidential election results because Fulton County doesn't have digital images of ballots.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Georgia was a pivotal swing state in the November 2020 election, and as such became a target of former U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive election disinformation campaign that baselessly alleged that a massive-scale voter fraud conspiracy cost him reelection.:One year after the election, Trump's supporters were still trying fruitlessly to prove Georgia's election was plagued by widespread fraud.On Nov. 9, 2021, Trump's supporters took to social media platforms like Twitter claiming that Fulton County, Georgia was missing digital image scans of all in-person ballots, and 17,690 absentee ballot images. For example, a Nov. 9, 2021, tweet from Christina Bobb, a host for conspiracy theory-promoting network One America News (OANN) stated:""ALL in person ballot images in GA are missing. 17,690 mail in ballot images are missing. This is FRAUD. So, GA has no way to verify that the ballots are legitimate reflections of what went through the machines."" Bobb's statement refers to digital scans of paper ballots created by voting systems.This statement is false, according to Gabriel Sterling, chief operating officer for the Georgia Secretary of State's Office, who called it not just a lie, but a ""truly dumb"" lie in this sharply-worded tweet::The statement in Bobb's tweet, that ""ALL in person ballot images in GA are missing. 17,690 mail in ballot images are missing,"" is apparently sourced from a Nov. 9, 2021, news conference held by Garland Favorito, co-founder of the VoterGA, an activist group that has sought to overturn Georgia's 2020 presidential election result.In an email to Snopes, Favorito stated that Fulton County informed VoterGA that it did not have digital images of in-person voter ballots in response to a public records request submitted by VoterGA.:Even if that's the case, claiming the missing ballot images equate to fraud is false framing, in that it invents a crisis where no crisis exists. The absence of scanned, digital images of ballots isn't an indication of fraud, nor does it mean there is ""no way to verify"" Georgia's election results.As Sterling indicated in the tweet above, Georgia's 2020 election results were counted three times, including a hand recount of the original paper ballots. The hand recount affirmed that the original machine count had accurately showed that Georgia voters chose U.S. President Joe Biden over Trump. A machine recount requested by Trump again affirmed Biden's victory in Georgia.A law that went into effect in March 2021, Georgia Senate Bill 202, will make digital images of ballots public record. Nevertheless it's the original paper ballots, not their digital images, that ""will remain the source of official vote counts, and they're kept in the government's custody, only unsealed by a judge's order,"" as the Atlanta Journal-Constitution noted, VoterGA was dealt a major legal defeat in its quest to find evidence of voter fraud when a judge in October 2021 threw out its lawsuit seeking to inspect absentee ballots.:"
291,291,163.KnightsTemplarStillL,"This article by Patrick Masters is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.On Christmas Day, 1119, the king of Jerusalem, Baldwin II persuaded a group of French knights led by Hugh de Payne II to save their souls by protecting pilgrims travelling the Holy Land. And so the Order of the Knights Templar was formed.This revolutionary order of knights lived as monks and took vows of poverty and chastity, but these were monks with a difference - they would take up arms as knights to protect the civilians using the dangerous roads of the newly conquered Kingdom of Jerusalem. From these humble beginnings, the order would grow to become one of the premier Christian military forces of the Crusades. Over the next 900 years, these warrior monks would become associated with the Holy Grail, the Freemasons and the occult. But are any of these associations true, or are they just baseless myth? :The Crusades ended in 1291 after the Christian capital of Acre fell to the Mameluke forces of Egypt and the Templars found themselves redundant. Despite their wealth and European holdings, their reason for existence had been to wage war in defence of the Holy Land. But the French king Philip IV was in debt to the Templar order and, with the Holy land lost, he capitalised on their vulnerability and had the Templars arrested in France on Friday October 13, 1307 in a dawn raid on their Paris Temple and residences. In 1312, the order was abolished by papal decree and in 1314 the last grand-master, Jacque de Molay, was burned at the stake in Paris with three other Templars. With the order destroyed, any surviving former members joined other orders or monasteries. Execution of Jacques de Molay in Paris, March 1314.Giovanni Villani, Nuova Cronica - ms. Chigiano L VIII 296 - Biblioteca VaticanaDespite the arrests and charges of heresy being laid against the order, a document known as the Chinon Parchment was found in 2001 in the Vatican's archives which documents that the Templars were, in fact, exonerated by the Catholic Church in 1312. But, despite clearing them of heresy, Pope Clement ordered that they be disbanded.  :Appropriation of a legendThe suppression of the Templars meant that there was nobody to safeguard their legacy. Since then, the order has been appropriated by other organisations - most notably as ancestors to the Masonic order in the 18th century and, more recently, by right-wing extremist groups such as the Knights Templar-UK and mass-murdering terrorist Anders Behring Breivik.The Knights Templar's association with Freemasonry is not so much a myth as it was a marketing campaign by 18th-century Freemasons to appeal to the aristocracy. Historian Frank Sanello explained in his 2003 book, The Knights Templars: God's Warriors, the Devil's Bankers, that initially it was Andrew Ramsey, a senior French Freemason of the era, who first made the link between the Freemasons and the Crusader knights. But he originally claimed the Freemasons were descended from the crusading Order of the Knight Hospitaller. Of course, the Hospitallers were still operational, unlike the Knight Templar, so Ramsey quickly changed his claim to the Templars being the Freemasons' crusading ancestry.:The Knights Templar had actually been mythologised in popular culture as early as the 13th century in the Grail epic Parzival by German knight and poet Wolfram von Eschenbach. In this Grail epic, the Knights Templar were included in the story as the guardians of the Grail. After the order's sudden fall, these warrior monks became associated with conspiracies and the occult. For some, a mystery still surrounds the fate of the Templar fortune (which was in reality seized by Phillip IV, with the majority of their property redistributed to the Hospitallers) and the Templar confessions (extracted under torture) to worshipping an idol dubbed Baphomet. The link between the Templars and the occult would resurface again in the 16th century in Henry Agrippa's book De Occulta Philosophia.Modern-day mythModern fiction continues to draw upon the widespread mysteries and fanciful theories. These mythical associations are key themes for many popular works of fiction, such as Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code in which the Templars guard the Grail. The Templar myth has also found its way into the digital gaming format in the globally successful Assassin's Creed franchise, in which the player must assassinate a villainous Templar.:https://www.youtube.com/embed/lfqHb6INj3w Nine centuries after they were formed, the Templars remain the most iconic and infamous order of knights from the Crusades. The Templar legacy has grown beyond their medieval military role and the name has become synonymous with the occult, conspiracies, the Holy Grail and the Freemasons. But these are all false narratives - fantastical, but misleading. The real legacy of the Templars remains with the Portuguese Order of Knights, Ordem dos Cavaleiros de Nosso Senhor Jesus Cristo (Order of the Knights of Jesus Christ). This order was created by King Diniz in 1319 with Papal permission due to the prominent role the Templars played in establishing the kingdom of Portugal. The new knighthood even moved into the Templars' former headquarters at Tomar. For historian Micheal Haag, this new order ""was the Templars under another name"" - but it pledged obedience to the king of Portugal and not the Pope like their Templar predecessors. :And so the essence of the Templar's successors still exists today as a Portuguese order of merit for outstanding service - and the Templar myth continues to provide a rich source of inspiration for artistic endeavours.:Patrick Masters, Lecturer in Film Studies, University of PortsmouthThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

292,292,434.LuciferaseIsNotanIng,"Claim:The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine contains luciferase. Rating:FalseAbout this rating In November 2021, Emerald Robinson, the White House correspondent for Newsmax, a conservative news network that has spread a number of conspiracy theories, posted a message on Twitter falsely claiming to her 400,000+ followers that one of the COVID-19 vaccines contains ""luciferase."" :This is false. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine does not contain luciferase.What Is Luciferase?This is not the first time that ""luciferase"" has been used to create fear over the COVID-19 vaccines. Back in April 2021, rumors circulated that the vaccines were called Luciferase, that they had been filed under an ""060606"" patent, and that this was evidence that the vaccines were connected in some form or other to Satan (or Lucifer).This is all false. Luciferase is a genuine scientific term that refers to an enzyme capable of emitting light. If you've ever seen a firefly light up, you've witnessed luciferase in action. These enzymes are often used in research studies because they can help researchers monitor biological processes. :Luciferases are enzymes that use a substrate called luciferin, along with oxygen and ATP, in an energetic process that produces light--like the yellow glow of fireflies. The power of luciferase has been harnessed by scientists to devise reactions whose light output is used to monitor biological processes including gene expression, biomolecular binding, and cell viability.It's not exactly clear what Robinson meant when she tweeted that Luciferase was being used so ""you can be tracked."" She seems to be implying that this bioluminescent marker will make vaccinated people glow, making them easier to track, but that's clearly not the case. Close to 200 million people in the United States have been fully vaccinated and as far as we can tell nobody is glowing. Is Luciferase in COVID-19 Vaccines?Robinson's tweet (which has since been removed) linked to a video that supposedly showed ""evidence"" that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine contains luciferase. In reality, this video highlighted one of the problems with the argument that people should ""do their own research."" :The video starts with a Google search for ""does Moderna vaccine contain Luciferase?"" The top result for this search was an article published by Reuters in May 2021 entitled: ""Fact Check-Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine does not contain luciferin or luciferase.""Reuters wrote: ""The novel coronavirus vaccine manufactured by Moderna does not contain luciferin, an organic compound involved in bioluminescence, or the enzyme luciferase, contrary to claims on social media. While luciferase was involved in some COVID-19 research in the summer of 2020, none of the available vaccines contain either ingredient.""The video then shows this person ""doing their own research"" as they go to Moderna's website, click through a few pages, and open a PDF related to the company's vaccine patents. The researcher then performs a search for the word ""luciferase"" and finds a match. While this person presents this discovery as if it's evidence that luciferase is in the vaccine, this video shows no such thing. What this person found was that Moderna referenced a study about ""Luciferase"" while filing their patent, not that they included Luciferase in the vaccine. The study this person highlighted was published in 2012.:As noted earlier, luciferase was used during the development of the vaccine but it is not one of the ingredients in the vaccine. Here's a list of ingredients in Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine:""The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine contains the following ingredients: messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), lipids (SM-102, polyethylene glycol [PEG] 2000 dimyristoyl glycerol [DMG], cholesterol, and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine [DSPC]), tromethamine, tromethamine hydrochloride, acetic acid, sodium acetate trihydrate, and sucrose."""
293,293,552.StudyAllegingaConnec,"A study based on anonymous email surveys of mothers who homeschool their children that suggested a correlation between vaccines and autism was published online on November 21st, 2016 in the journal Frontiers in Public Health. On November 28th, that article (titled ""Vaccination and Health Outcomes: A Survey of 6- to 12-year-old Vaccinated and Unvaccinated Children based on Mothers' Reports"") was removed and deleted after the journal faced widespread criticism of its methods and motives.As reported by Retraction Watch:The abstract -- published online in Frontiers in Public Health after being accepted November 21 -- reported findings from anonymous online questionnaires completed by 415 mothers of home-schooled children 6-12 years old. Nearly 40 percent of children had not been vaccinated, and those that had were three times more likely to be diagnosed with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, the study found.The only statement released by Frontiers in Public Health was this brief Twitter reply to critics, which claimed that the paper had been only ""provisionally"" accepted despite appearing in a finalized form online::This article was provisionally accepted but not published. In response to concerns raised, we have reopened its review.The fact that a study alleging a link between autism and vaccines -- a decades-long controversy with no mainstream scientific support and whose origins are rooted in another retracted and unethical study -- was taken down at all has led some anti-vaccine groups to imply some sort of nefarious plot to hide the truth from the public.This particular study, however, was fatally flawed on three levels: it was problematic in its design; the authors had a clear agenda combined with a financial conflict of interest; and the journal that published it is widely considered to be predatory, with a track record of publishing deeply flawed, controversial, and biased research with limited or sloppy peer-review. First a look at the study's design, as captured by a screenshot of its abstract before the page was removed::Homeschool organizations in four states (Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oregon) were asked to forward an email to their members, requesting mothers to complete an anonymous online questionnaire on the vaccination status and health outcomes of their biological children ages 6 to 12. [...]A total of 415 mothers provided data on 666 children, of which 261 (39%) were unvaccinated. Vaccinated children were significantly less likely than the unvaccinated to have been diagnosed with chickenpox and pertussis, but significantly more likely to have been diagnosed with pneumonia, otitis media, allergies and NDDs (defined as Autism Spectrum Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and/or a learning disability).As ScienceBlog's David Gorski noted on his blog Respectful Insolence, the population selected for the study is far from a representative sample (it's a homeschool population from only four states), and 666 individuals are nowhere near enough participants from which to draw any sort of significant conclusion:First, this survey questioned 415 mothers of 666 children educated at home. Not only is that not a representative sample, given that all the children are home-schooled, it's not even a very big sample. [...] To find any statistically significant, much less clinically significant differences in health outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated children would require huge numbers.:Another critique of its methods is the fact that the study grouped autism with a series of other ""neurodevelopmental disorders"" (which included Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and any other learning disability) without making a distinction between these very different conditions in their results.As bloggers and internet sleuths uncovered, this study appears to have been financially supported by individuals with an anti-vaccine agenda. A November 2012 post on the anti-vaccine blog ""Age of Autism"" promoted a study concept identical to the retracted study and which was to be carried out by the same research institution.That post encouraged readers to donate to Jenny McCarthy's anti-vaccine charity ""Generation Rescue"" (the post itself was written by J. B. Handey, the co-founder of that charity) and assured readers that ""100%"" of the money would go to the study, which it claimed was short by around 400,000 dollars:In order to finish the work and see the first documented data comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated children, an additional $400,000 needs to be raised. [...] If you can help, please donate directly through the Generation Rescue website, HERE.(Note: Generation Rescue is not conducting the study, we just want to see the study completed so the data can be collected and analyzed, whatever the outcome. By clicking through this donation link, you can make sure 100% of your donation goes to the study.):In addition, over and above conflicts of interest in funding, Anthony Mawson -- the study's lead author and a visiting professor at Jackson State University -- has long been a vocal proponent of the link between Autism and Vaccines. In 2007 he allegedly (according to archived webpages) wrote a letter arguing against the retraction of Andrew Wakefield's 1998 paper that originally proposed that link -- a position well outside the mainstream scientific consensus. He also alleged in a 2011 lawsuit (later dismissed) that he lost his job due to his views on vaccine safety.Finally, the journal Frontiers in Public Health, and indeed the entire Frontiers series of journals, have exercised dubious judgement in their editorial decisions. Some reporters consider the journal to be overtly predatory -- enticing fringe research with lax peer review and a pay-to-play business model.As reported by Retraction Watch in July 2016, Frontiers in Public Health published and then retracted a study on chemtrails -- the longstanding conspiracy theory about the dangers of cloud trails released from jet planes. In one of its more infamous episodes, Frontiers in Public Health published an article that questioned the link between HIV and AIDS, titled ""Questioning the HIV-AIDS hypothesis: 30 years of dissent."" In response to the criticism of this controversial paper, the editors' solution was to ""reclassify"" the paper from an original research paper to an ""opinion paper."":It does not appear that the peer review process was well run in this recent vaccine study either. One of the two people who peer reviewed the study was actually a chiropractor named Linda Mullin Elkins with no published research on the subject of autism or any background in vaccine research.Frontiers in Public Health has yet to issue a formal retraction as the study's review has been ""reopened"". It is hard to see, though, how a poorly designed, limited-population study based solely on an anonymous email survey funded by organizations or individuals with an agenda, published in a journal that allows a chiropractor to review a study about the health risks of vaccines, could pass any reasonable definition of publishable."
294,294,47.NASALithiumChemtrail,"Claim:NASA admitted to dosing Americans with airborne lithium.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 19 April 2016, the web site AnonHQ published an article that purported to show ""proof"" NASA admitted to spraying lithium into the atmosphere:There's the official explanation for why NASA is spraying lithium, a pharmaceutical drug most often used to treat people with manic depression or bi-polar disorder, into our ionosphere, and then there is the probable reason(s). It would be easier to accept NASA's official explanation if they were not so secretive about everything they study and do in space - but one thing is for certain - NASA's own personnel have admitted that lithium, along with other chemicals, are intentionally being placed into our environment regularly. It is possible that many of NASA's own employees aren't even aware of the true motivations for carrying out such a project, ironically displaying the very behaviors that these chemicals/pharmaceuticals are meant to instill.In the first bomb-shell video a NASA employee ([redacted]@nasa.gov) admits that lithium is being sprayed in the atmosphere, and says that it is ""harmless to the environment."":NASA Confesses to Thoughts on this? ? Dosing Americans with Air-borne Lithium & Other Chemicals AnonHQ https://t.co/zfElekED5a-- Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) April 19, 2016The article then launched into assigning of purported motives for dosing Americans with lithium, a potent anti-manic psychiatric medication. From there, the article made its case for the existence of a NASA lithium spraying program (without any citations, and bearing a strong similarity to a previous hoax):It is very real, and there is ample scientific documentation to corroborate what I put forth here:A Pub Med abstract titled, Feasibility of Aerosol Vaccinations in Humans discusses how an increase in antigen volumes can be beneficial in aerosol delivery of vaccines, and could be used in ""developing countries and disaster areas."" The abstract also admits that several thousand human subjects have already been aerosol vaccinated with live attenuated measles and influenza A vaccines. The executive summary further states that aerosol vaccinations are ideal for ""large populations."" This has apparently been happening since as early as 2003.:Another discussion of aerosolized vaccinations can be found in The New England Journal of Medicine. A Randomized, Controlled Trial of Aerosolized Vaccines Against Measles states that these vaccines were tested on children in India that were as young 9 months old.The World Health Organization has been researching aerosol vaccines for years now, as have ""philanthropic"" agencies which have clear aims to sterilize the population. It is also worth noting that the pharmaceutical industry has been absolved from any legal responsibility for medicating the masses since they were awarded legal protection from all lawsuits by Congress in 1986. This law was challenged, but upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2011. Many powerful agencies are making sure that we ""take our medicine.""In fact, many nations are participating in our unwitting, forced vaccination, and the dumping of any number of attenuated viruses, chemical concoctions and other 'chemtrails' on our heads with dogged frequency.The Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR) considered giving a license application to PaxVax Australia (PaxVax) for the intentional release of a GMO vaccine consisting of live bacteria into the environment in Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Victoria. They planned to release cholera on their people.:According to the regulator, this GMO vaccine qualified as a limited and controlled release under section 50A of the Gene Technology Act 2000.Of course, we can't ignore the USA. Michael Greenwood wrote an article stating that:""The incidence of human West Nile virus cases can be significantly reduced through large-scale aerial spraying that targets adult mosquitoes, according to research by the Yale School of Public Health and the California Department of Public Health.""Buried among the tinfoil were a few actual facts: that 2003 study does exist, but it studied aerosolized vaccines -- i.e. ones that are inhaled as opposed to injected -- and had nothing to do with dropping chemicals from planes. Another unrelated piece of ""proof"" offered up by the author was the widespread and well-documented efforts to combat the spread of West Nile virus by spraying insecticide, initiatives that targeted mosquitos, not humans. The excerpt also referenced ""GMO vaccines,"" a term we were unable to even define (a 1998 paper speculated on the promise of ""genetically engineered vaccines"").:Also included was a video titled ""NASA admits chemtrails,"" published to YouTube on 13 July 2013 (and purportedly recorded three days earlier): The clip (which had no video component, only audio) was purported to be a recorded phone call between a woman identified only as ""Sue"" and NASA astrophysicist Douglas Rowland.""Sue"" brought up a video she watched in which lithium was mentioned, and the exchange that followed illustrated how the caller and the NASA scientist were carrying on entirely separate conversations. Sue fixated on the use of the word ""lithium"" as Rowland tried to explain NASA's study of the upper atmosphere, and why conditions there differed from those at lower altitudes::Sue: When the article came out in the major newspapers including The Huffington Post there was no mention of lithium, not one. Not one mention of lithium until I heard the recording of the actual ... I ... listened to the rockets go off. I had no idea there was going to be a lithium dispersed until I heard 'Payload ... lithium ... dispersed.'""Rowland: Right, there was lithium dispersed and I'd be happy to talk about it. I think you may be under so misconceptions about what we're doing, but I'm happy to tell you any details that you need.Sue: It says in your article that you're doing it for communications.Rowland: There are many reasons we're doing it because we don't understand how the wind in the upper atmosphere moves. Chemtrails ... there are different kinds of chemtrails. Different trails at night. We use different trails during the day. The wind blows them around. They glow either on their own or from scattered sunlight. We take pictures and we can see how the wind trail moves around. It's just like if you were taking a picture of an airplane contrail. You could use that to see how the wind was blowing. This is much higher altitude so we use these chemical trails.:Sue: What is the purpose of knowing what the wind's going to do in the ionosphere?Rowland: The purpose is really to understand our planet. It's very fundamental science. Every day we know there is electrical current that flow over the head that is naturally there. They have been there ever since the Earth had an atmosphere and electrical field. And the wind is driven by the sun. The sun heats the atmosphere, the wind blows and every day that wind drives an electric current and we're trying to understand what causes that. Simply how does it work in detail, and also importantly when the sun becomes active with lots of sun spots and lots of magnetic activity that changes the wind pattern and changes the electric current. We want to understand both what it is on a regular day when there is no solar activity and then what it is when there is a lot of solar activity.Sue: Is there some other way you can do it without dispersing the lithium?Rowland: We're researching other ways. The lithium is actually harmless to the environment and we can show you more about that but it is tricky to use because it's very faint. You can't see it with your naked eye. You have to have special cameras to see it so we don't like to use it for that reason. It's hard measurement to make. We're researching other ways to put censors directly on the rocket to measure the wind and those are ongoing. We're trying to develop them now and one of the purposes of this mission was to do that.:Between incorrectly framed data about unrelated studies of mass vaccination or West Nile virus spraying and the video, AnonHQ concluded that ""hopefully we've established that this IS happening,"" when neither the article nor video had established any such thing. What actually transpired was folks (one of whom harassed a NASA scientist and encouraged others to do the same) misinterpreted publicized scientific research to fit a pre-existing conspiracy theory. In the conversation between Rowland and Sue (during which portions were clearly elided) the only admissions made were those about the detail of upper atmosphere study, already publicly disclosed on a regular basis by NASA and linked in this article.The use of lithium in such research was neither a secret nor cause for concern. NASA published an article in January 2013 explaining its purpose, one of many highlighting projects of the nature Rowland discussed:NASA successfully launched a Terrier-Improved Orion suborbital rocket at 5:50 p.m. EST this evening from the Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia.During the flight, two red-colored lithium vapor trails were produced. Reports from those viewing the launch or vapor trails came from as far away as the Outer Banks, N.C.; eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey.Two different methods for creating the lithium vapor were tested to determine which configuration is best for observing various science phenomena in space.NASA has two missions later this year that will use lithium trails to assist scientists in observing events in space ... In the technology test launch, two canisters in the rocket's payload section contained solid metal lithium rods or chips embedded in a thermite cake. The thermite was ignited and produced heat to vaporize the lithium. The vapor was released in space to be detected and tracked optically.The lithium combustion process posed no threat to the public during the release in space. When heated, the lithium rods change to lithium vapor and small amounts of lithium oxide. The thermite reaction produces iron and aluminum oxide.:NASA similarly reported the same sort of research in July 2011, in an openly-available article about the observation of lithium trails in the upper atmosphere:The rockets -- known as sounding rockets from the nautical term ""to sound,"" meaning to measure -- will launch sometime between July 5 and 23 depending on ionospheric and weather conditions. NASA's sounding rocket program at Wallops dates back to the agency's inception in 1958. Not only do sounding rockets offer a low cost way to access space, they also provide access to areas of the atmosphere too low for satellites.In this experiment, the scientists will fly two pair of rockets. One in each pair will measure data about the charged or ""ionized"" gas -- called plasma -- as well as the neutral gas, through which it travels. The other will shoot out a long trail of lithium gas to track the wind movement. The instrumented rockets are 40 feet long and 17 inches in diameter, carrying a payload of 600 lbs. The lithium rockets are 14 inches in diameter and are about six feet long.Beginning July 5, the team will set up each day from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. EDT, ready to launch as soon as there's evidence of currents in the ionosphere as well as a crystal clear skies - necessary for successful observation of the lithium trail.:With all the focus conspiracy sites placed on NASA, none appeared to discover the agency's explanation of purpose for lithium in rocket launches (published in 1958 and available freely on the agency's web site):Chemical propellants in common use deliver specific impulse values ranging from about 175 up to about 300 seconds. The most energetic chemical propellants are theoretically capable of specific impulses up to about 400 seconds.High values of specific impulse are obtained from high exhaust-gas temperature, and from exhaust gas having very low (molecular) weight. To be efficient, therefore, a propellant should have a large heat of combustion to yield high temperatures, and should produce combustion products containing simple, light molecules embodying such elements as hydrogen (the lightest), carbon, oxygen, fluorine, and the lighter metals (aluminum, beryllium, lithium) ...Devices such as the nuclear rocket must use some chemical as a working fluid or propellant, although no energy is supplied to the rocket by any chemical reaction ... Propellants that would be suitable for use in electric propulsion devices are the easily ionized metals. The one most generally considered is cesium; next best are rubidium, potassium, sodium, and lithium.:On 21 April 2016, we spoke with both Rowland and NASA's Keith Koehler. Koehler confirmed that the tracer rockets in question operated at far higher altitudes than commercial aircraft (chemtrail conspiracies focus on lower altitudes). Koehler explained why vapor tracers were necessary to measure atmospheric conditions:Vapor tracers used in NASA suborbital rocket missions allow scientist to see that which is not visible to the naked eye. They are used to measure atmospheric winds and/or ion drifts in the upper atmosphere and ionosphere, typically between 50 and 248 miles altitude (Commercial aircraft fly around six miles altitude.). The vapor is released along a portion of the rocket trajectory. The small amount of vapor is then visible from the ground. By tracking their motions directly with cameras on the ground (or in an airplane), these tracers make it possible to observe the movements of the upper atmosphere or the ionosphere directly.The purpose of the measurements is to understand how the natural upper atmospheric winds and/or ion drifts behave, not to change them. The releases would therefore have little value if they were changing the behavior of the upper atmosphere or ionosphere. The tracers are released in a part of the atmosphere where meteors from space deposit 100 to 200 tons of metallic material every day across the globe compared to a one-pound tracer release, for example. The meteors contain the same types of metallic material used in the tracers.:Use of lithium as a chemical propellant and research agent by NASA was not novel or secretive -- the rudimentary information on NASA's web site was first published in 1958. Conspiracy theorists latched on to the use of the word ""lithium"" and extrapolated that it was used by NASA to surreptitiously drug the populace. NASA openly ""admitted"" to using lithium in a manner widely expected of that element, but use of the word ""admitted"" also implied disclosure by accident or under duress. The practice was well documented both by NASA and outside research, and bore no hallmarks of a long-running plot to surreptitiously drug Americans under the guise of rocket launches."
295,295,405.WereChesterBenningto,"Claim:Chester Bennington and Chris Cornell were murdered because they were about to reveal a ring of pedophiles.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 21 July 2017, the junk news website Your News Wire (now News Punch) published a story reporting that Linkin Park singer Chester Bennington, who passed away on 20 July 2017 in his Palos Verdes Estates home near Los Angeles, had been murdered in similar fashion to his friend, Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell, who died two months earlier.:Both Bennington's and Cornell's deaths have been ruled suicides by hanging by Los Angeles County and Wayne County medical examiners, respectively. Cornell died on 18 May 2017 in his hotel room after a concert in Detroit, while Bennington passed away at his Palos Verdes Estates home on 20 July 2017. The two men were friends -- in fact, Bennington took his life on what would have been Cornell's 53rd birthday. But rumors that their deaths were connected in any nefarious way are based on speculation and not evidence, and Your News Wire's headline thus falsely proclaims ""Police: Chester Bennington Was Murdered.""Citing a ""police source,"" Your News Wire asserted that authorities were investigating Bennington's death as a homicide:Detectives are looking into whether Chester Bennington was murdered, with the death scene later arranged to resemble a suicide. They have put a team of investigators in place and are refusing to rule out a criminal homicide charge.""Murders are sometimes made to look like suicides. We think he was murdered, we just have to find out who was behind it,"" said a police source.:It's unclear what ""detectives"" Your News Wire could possibly have obtained such a quote from. Palos Verdes Estates police have not commented on the case and have instead referred all inquiries to the coroner's office. The police department for that small coastal community south of Los Angeles contracts with the much larger Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to handle homicides, and the Sheriff's Homicide Bureau told us they did not respond to Bennington's death. The quote doesn't appear in any other news report about the incident.We have spoken to all the agencies that have jurisdiction over Bennington's home and can confirm that, contrary to what Your News Wire reported, law enforcement has not said Bennington was murdered.The celebrity status of both men means relevant details about their deaths are publicly available. Cornell's autopsy report has been uploaded online, and in that report, Wayne County assistant medical examiner Dr. Theodore Brown notes that Cornell's bodyguard discovered him in the bathroom of his Detroit hotel room with an exercise band around his neck. Ligature marks were found around Cornell's neck, and the cause of death was determined to be suicide by hanging.:The Los Angeles County Coroners told us the official cause of Bennington's death was also a suicide by hanging and that an autopsy report would be forthcoming at the end of July 2017.Your News Wire also quoted Randy Cody, a person they described as an ""investigator"":Detroit police wrapped up their investigations quickly and the Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office ruled the death a suicide, but investigators are claiming that unexplained gaps in the official timeline of Cornell's final moments and suspicious inconsistencies in the records suggest that Cornell's death was not suicide at all, but a premeditated homicide and cover up.Investigator Randy Cody is among those questioning the suicide ruling. He points to perceived timeline gaps, forensic questions and what he says are two signs that Cornell had a head wound that was not mentioned in autopsy reports.Cody may be an amateur sleuth, but he is not a law enforcement investigator. He is a blogger who runs The Metal Den web site, where he occupies himself coming up with various theories to prove Cornell was murdered. He was interviewed for a Detroit News story about theories surrounding the singer's death by fans unsatisfied with the suicide ruling, which is where Your News Wire lifted this information from.:A piece of supposed evidence cited by Cody is a head wound he believes he saw in a YouTube video of Cornell's last performance at Detroit's Fox Theater on 17 May 2017 and an unverified recording of radio traffic in which a medic claimed to have seen a wound on the head of an unnamed victim. No mention was made of a head wound in the autopsy report, prompting accusations that the information was ""suppressed."" However in the image from the concert it appears the ""wound"" is simply red stage light reflecting off the singer's skin.In a 22 May 2017 post, Cody claimed Cornell was murdered because he was about to expose pedophiles involved in PizzaGate, a debunked conspiracy theory holding that a child sex trafficking ring linked to Hillary Clinton was being run out of Comet Ping Pong, a Washington, D.C., pizzeria. No evidence was offered linking Bennington to the non-existent PizzaGate conspiracy other than a circumstantial reference to a revelation he made in a rock magazine interview that he had been molested when he was a child. PizzaGate has been debunked by none other than conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who was one of the key figures in originally spreading it. Jones apologized and retracted the claim after a man intent on ""rescuing"" children went to the pizzeria with a rifle in December 2016 and opened fire inside.:Your News Wire is not a reliable source of information -- they regularly post inaccurate articles and unfounded conspiracy theories. There is no evidence that Bennington or Cornell were murdered in an effort to cover up a debunked pedophile sex ring."

One of Fields' former high school teachers, Derek Weimer, told the Cincinnati Enquirer that the young man's political views were extreme and flavored with Nazism:Weimer said that he knew of Fields' political leanings early on. He said another teacher filed a report during Fields' freshman year over something Fields had written for an assignment ""that just went beyond the pale.""""It was very much along the party lines of the neo-Nazi movement,"" Weimer said.Photos taken earlier on the day of the attack show Fields standing shoulder-to-shoulder with members of Charlottesville's Vanguard America, wearing the group's standard uniform and holding a shield with their logo, the fasces:James Alex Fields was w/ the Vanguard America folks in #Charlottesville.

Using a right-wing nationalist slogan, Blood and Soil, VA romanticizes the notion that people with ""white blood"" have a special bond with ""American soil."" This philosophy first originated in Germany (as Blut und Boden) and was later popularized by Hitler's regime. In the same vein, VA uses ""For Race and Nation"" as a variant slogan. Following this theme, VA maintains that America ""is to be a nation exclusively for the White American peoples who out of the barren hills, empty plains, and vast mountains forged the most powerful nation to ever have existed."":All of the above notwithstanding, the unreliable web site YourNewsWire.com declared that the mainstream media were ""suppressing"" proof that the vehicular attacker was ""a left-wing operative at the heart of a false flag designed to spark civil war, introduce martial law, and take away the rights of conservative groups to assemble peacefully"":The man accused of being a neo-Nazi and murdering a woman by deliberately driving into her during protests in Charlottesville is in reality a supporter of Hillary Clinton and member of Antifa in receipt of funding by George Soros, according to reports.James Fields, 20, of Maumee, Ohio, allegedly killed Heather Heyer, aged 32, and injured 19 others when he rammed his car into a group of protesters on Saturday in Charlottesville, Virginia.Mainstream media is claiming Fields is a neo-Nazi and has conveniently produced photographs showing Fields standing with Vanguard America and carrying a shield bearing the group's insignia.Another right-leaning web site, Freedom Daily, didn't mention Fields at all, blaming the attack instead on an ""Antifa terrorist"" involved in a left-wing ""false flag"" conspiracy::Although it was originally reported that the driver of the car was a far right sympathizer it's now been confirmed that it was indeed a Democrat Party member and Antifa terrorist drove his car into free speech advocates in Charlottesville Virginia this morning.It is common for revolutionary groups such as Antifa to use methods like this to implicate their enemies in order to evoke violence and start a civil war, which is what they have been working towards since Donald Trump won the presidency in November of 2016.Neither site has a leg to stand on. YourNewsWire provided no evidence that Fields was a ""left-wing operative."" Freedom Daily joined Gateway Pundit, Alt Right Real News, GotNews.com, and other reliably unreliable sources in regurgitating misinformation put out by Internet ""sleuths"" who blithely fingered an innocent teenager for the crime. These sites accused Joel Vangheluwe (who turned out to be the son of a former owner of the attack vehicle) of being the Charlottesville killer::Vangheluwe, who is from Macomb County, Michigan, has been the target of death threats since these web sites named him, according to local news reports:A Macomb County businessman and his family are living in fear after his teenage son was falsely rumored to have been the driver who plowed a car into a crowd protesting a white supremacist rally in Virginia.Jerome Vangheluwe of Bruce Township said his son was incorrectly identified by several right-wing websites as being the owner and driver of a Dodge Challenger that rammed through counter-protestors Saturday, killing a woman and wounding at least 19 others.Vangheluwe says even though he sold the car years ago, the family was being targeted for death threats from people mistakenly believing the son, Joel, was responsible for the horrific act.The Michigan State Police responded to the threats against Vangheluwe by affirming that there is no known Michigan connection to the Charlottesville attack::.2) Local media if you are contacted by other outlets there is not a Michigan connection that we are aware of at this time.-- MSP Metro Detroit (@mspmetrodet) August 12, 2017Some of the sites that got it so egregiously wrong -- Gateway Pundit, for one -- quietly deleted their erroneous posts and moved on without issuing corrections or retractions. Others, such as GotNews.com, published corrections -- and then congratulated themselves for doing so. Freedom Daily updated their page to identify the right suspect, but perpetuated their ""leftists did it"" scenario by claiming the driver lost control while trying to ""escape"" anti-fascist demonstrators who were allegedly throwing things at his car, and never meant to hurt anyone (a claim directly contradicted by Charlottesville's police chief, who described the vehicular attack as ""premeditated"").All these reports dovetail into a grander conspiracy theory peddled by InfoWars founder Alex Jones and his ilk, exemplified in the rambling, hour-long video rant below, part of an InfoWars.com post entitled ""Virginia Riots Staged to Bring in Martial Law, Ban Conservative Gatherings"". In brief, Jones claims that the violence in Charlottesville is but one example of a well-orchestrated plot by billionaire leftist George Soros, former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), ""globalists,"" the ""deep state"", Jewish actors pretending to be neo-Nazis, and God only knows who else to foment unrest, start a race war, bring down President Trump, and pave the way for martial law in the United States::We listened in vain for Jones to provide any evidence for these claims beyond vague references to WikiLeaks e-mails in which highly placed Democrats supposedly discussed ""controlling"" the populace by keeping them ""in the dark"" and ""desperate"":Now, if you go back to the WikiLeaks from over a year ago, the Democratic Party is sending e-mails to George Soros and back and forth at the highest levels of the Democratic Party, saying, ""We're losing the public. Minorities are getting into free market. We want to keep people in their mother's basements as baristas.' ""Remember even Hillary said that. 'What are we going to do to keep control of them? Keep them in the dark, keep them desperate. These are quotes. Hundreds and hundred of e-mails. We've covered them, written articles about it, linking to them. They didn't deny that they're real. They're real. They said what do we do? They said we go to culture war.:""These are quotes,"" Jones said, but when we attempted to verify that Clinton actually uttered the words ""What are we going to do to keep control of them? Keep them in the dark, keep them desperate,"" we found nothing in any public sources, including WikiLeaks.org, to confirm it -- and in point of fact, we found no published statements even vaguely resembling those.We were able to confirm something Hillary Clinton did not say, however, namely: ""We want to keep people in their mother's basements as baristas."" Ironically, the place we were able to confirm it was Jones' own web site, InfoWars.com, which in October 2016 reposted an article from pro-Putin news site Russia Today alleging that Clinton had described rival Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders' younger supporters as ""basement dwellers"" and ""baristas"" -- which wasn't really accurate either.Here's what Clinton really said, transcribed from an audio clip posted on InfoWars (and elsewhere): Some [Sanders supporters] are new to politics completely. They're children of the Great Recession. And they are living in their parents' basement. They feel that they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves. And they don't see much of a future. I met with a group of young black millennials today and, you know, one of the young women said, ""You know, none of us feel that we have the job that we should have gotten out of college. And we don't believe the job market is going to give us much of a chance."" So that is a mindset that is really affecting their politics. And so if you're feeling like you're consigned to, you know, being a barista, or you know, some other job that doesn't pay a lot, and doesn't have some other ladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing. So I think we all should be really understanding of that and we should try to do the best we can not to be, you know, a wet blanket on idealism. We want people to be idealistic.....:To recap, there's virtually nothing accurate in Alex Jones' statement purporting to quote Hillary Clinton and WikiLeaks. We've addressed an inquiry to InfoWars for clarification, and await their reply."
297,297,686.ObamaPlantoDepopulat,"Claim:   The Obama administration plans to displace thousands of Montana residents to give their land over to Native Americans. FALSEExample:   [Collected via e-mail, January 2014]Is this true? ... ""Obama Plan to Depopulate Montana Raises Crisis Fears in Moscow""?   Origins:   December saw the announcement of a controversial ruling by the federal Environment Protection Agency (EPA) altering the borders of the Wind River Indian Reservation (located in the central western portion of Wyoming) to re-incorporate portions of the reservation that had been ceded to non-native settlement since 1905, in the process placing the city of Riverton, Wyoming, and its population of over 10,000 residents within the boundaries of that Indian reservation::A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ruling that declared Riverton part of the Wind River Indian Reservation for the purposes of some regulations has state officials flip flopping, according to the Northern Arapaho Business Council.The Environmental Protection Agency's boundary determination was publicized [in early December 2013] and clarifies the effect of a 1905 federal land act that has been a point of contention between tribal and non-tribal members for decades.State, county and local officials have lampooned the environmental regulators for making a decision about Indian Country boundaries. They claim the ruling will be a nightmare for local courts, law enforcement and tax collectors. Tribal members claim the ruling is a long-overdue recognition and something the state once supported.Approximately 2 percent of Wyoming's population reside in the small city of Riverton in the heart of the state. That's about 10.5K residents. Now, if a mandate of the Environment Protection Agency goes forward, those residents, along with others within a 1 million acre area, will officially be living on an Indian reservation.In a petition to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the State of Wyoming, through the Attorney General, claimed the EPA used incomplete facts and faulty legal conclusions when making its decision to change existing law and alter the boundary of the State and the Wind River Reservation (WRR).:Wyoming Governor Matt Mead begged the federal agency to change their tune. He said, ""I understand that the Northern Arapaho and Eastern Shoshone Tribes have a different opinion about the Wind River Reservation Boundary. My deep concern is about an administrative agency of the federal government altering a state's boundary and going against over 100 years of history and law. This should be a concern to all citizens because, if the EPA can unilaterally take land away from a state, where will it stop?""Congress diminished the Wind River Reservation in 1905 and the matter has been the subject of debate at times since then. In 1905, Riverton's population was less than 500.""It is crucial that the EPA stay its decision. We need certainty while this is reviewed by the EPA and while Wyoming continues to prepare a legal challenge to this decision as well. This is too important and too flawed a decision not to pursue every avenue possible,"" Governor Mead said.In January 2014 the WhatDoesItMean.com political conspiracy site touched on this issue with an article positing that Obama administration was set to displace ""over 118,000 Montanans"" and ""steal their homes"" by similarly altering the borders of the Flathead Indian Reservation::A shocking report prepared by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of the Russian Federation (MINPRIRODY) circulating in the Kremlin today warns that the Obama regime has begun ""a rapid implementation"" of what will eventually become the largest internal displacement of American citizens in history that experts warn will ""most certainly"" lead to civil war in the United States.As to the exact methodology being implemented by the Obama regime against its own citizens in this planned mass depopulation event, this report says, involves the use of US environmental agencies seizing millions of acres of land from their present American owners and transferring its ownership to their indigenous population in areas known as Indian Reservations.This report [says that] Riverton, Wyoming is ""just the beginning"" of the Obama regime's plans to divest these rural Americans of their homes and land with the entire western half of the State of Montana set to become the next target of depopulation.Like Riverton, Wyoming, this report continues, the Obama regime's EPA next is set to steal the homes and lands of over 118,000 Montanans that are surrounded by the Flathead Indian Reservation using as a pretext US federal water laws which on the EPA's own website states can be made up by Obama anytime he wants.Many readers encountered this item about Montana's supposed ""depopulation"" on news-like web sites such as The Top Information Post or The European Union Times, but those reports were simply unvetted word-for-word reprintings of an article that originated with WhatDoesItMean.com, of which the RationalWiki says::Sorcha Faal is the alleged author of an ongoing series of ""reports"" published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don't think much of it. Each report resembles a news story in its style, but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don't contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish.The issue involving the EPA and the boundaries of the Wind River Indian Reservation Riverton in Wyoming is real; claims about the Obama administration's ""depopulating"" Montana to give U.S. citizens' land over land to Native Americans is not.  The latter are, depending upon one's point of view, paranoid conspiracy ramblings or trenchant political satire.Last updated:   27 January 2014:"
298,298,402.NoTrumpIsntTacticall,"Claim:U.S. President Donald Trump is going to ""tactically"" implement voter interference sanctions from a 2018 executive order. Rating:FalseAbout this rating Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.In mid-December 2020, a copy-pasted (""copypasta"") meme spread on social media platforms warning ""patriots"" that U.S. President Donald Trump was about to ""tactically"" implement elements of an executive order on election security signed in 2018, telling them to have weapons ""at the ready"":::The meme is an example of copypasta, a term that refers to blocks of text that go viral when social media users share them by copying and pasting them forward.The incendiary meme appears to reference an executive order signed by Trump on Sept. 12, 2018, ahead of the midterm elections. The meme claimed that Trump was to implement parts of the order at some point between Dec. 18 and Dec. 24, 2020.Here is a portion of the text:This will freeze the money and assets of people and entities to include Facebook, Twitter, the Fake News Corp, AND Chinese U.S. financial accounts. Be prepared to assist the National Guard and the military commands in defense of Our nation. Make sure that you have your weapons at the ready. But DO NOT interfere with the operations of the military. During this time, local law enforcement will have no authority. So, assemble small Patriot teams to patrol and secure your own and surrounding neighborsTrump's 2018 executive order has nothing to do with military or National Guard deployment domestically, nor does it mention the broad suspension of financial assets of social media platforms and ""Chinese U.S. financial accounts."" The meme appears to actually be referencing extreme calls by some of Trump's supporters, echoing his false claims that the November 2020 election was beset by mass-scale fraud and advocating that Trump impose martial law in response.:The 2018 executive order -- signed less than a month before the 2018 midterm elections -- was meant as a deterrent against foreign election interference. The order stated that the Trump administration was ready to implement sanctions against any foreign entity that interfered in the election process.It's noteworthy that the order was signed ahead of the first national election since 2016, during which the Russian government interfered in an effort to sow chaos in the U.S. and help Trump's electoral efforts. Trump was under political pressure at that time to stem similar interference in 2018.Notably, Facebook and Twitter are American companies, not foreign entities. It's unclear to us what exactly ""Fake News Corp"" refers to, but unsurprisingly, no such company exists. Sanctions can't be imposed on a fictional entity.The 2018 executive order relies on various department heads to make determinations about foreign election interference and potential sanctions -- in other words, it doesn't give Trump unilateral authority to take action.:For example, it gives the director of national intelligence 45 days to determine whether foreign interference in an election had occurred, at which point the assessment must be delivered to ""the President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security.""After further consultation between these department heads, the executive order then leaves the secretary of treasury, who is currently Steve Mnuchin, to lead in the implementation of economic sanctions. The departments of Treasury and State would then assess whether additional sanctions were necessary and present their findings to the White House.The copypasta meme appears to be inflammatory fear mongering that plays on a disinformation campaign carried out by Trump and his supporters that the election was stolen by way of a massive-fraud conspiracy. Trump's own U.S. Department of Homeland Security debunked this conspiracy theory by stating that the November 2020 election was in fact ""the most secure in American history."":"
299,299,581.WhereDidObamasMoneyC,"Claim:   Barack Obama's education and house were paid for with money obtained from questionable sources.FALSEExample:   [Collected via e-mail, October 2008]Written by a female Obama supporter who voted for him for president.Legitimate QuestionsTo All My Friends, this is every important, please take the time to read it.This election has me very worried. So many things to consider. About a year ago I would have voted for Obama. I have changed my mind three times since than. I watch all the news channels, jumping from one to another. I must say this drives my husband crazy. But, I feel if you view MSNBC, CNN, and Fox News, you might get some middle ground to work with. About six months ago, I started thinking 'where did the money come from for Obama'. I have four daughters who went to College, and we were middle class, and money was tight. We (including my girls) worked hard and there were lots of student loans.:I started looking into Obama's life.Around 1979 Obama started college at Occidental in California. He is very open about his two years at Occidental, he tried all kinds of drugs and was wasting his time but, even though he had a brilliant mind, did not apply himself to his studies. 'Barry' (that was the name he used all his life) during this time had two roommates, Muhammad Hasan Chandoo and Wahid Hamid, both from Pakistan. During the summer of 1981, after his second year in college, he made a 'round the world' trip. Stopping to see his mother in Indonesia, next Hyderabad in India, three weeks in Karachi, Pakistan where he stayed with his roommate's family, then off to Africa to visit his father's family. My question - Where did he get the money for this trip? Nether I, nor any one of my children would have had money for a trip like this when they where in college. When he came back he started school at Columbia University in New York. It is at this time he wants everyone to call him Barack -- not Barry. Do you know what the tuition is at Columbia? It's not cheap! to say the least. Where did he get money for tuition? Student Loans? Maybe. After Columbia, he went to Chicago to work as a Community Organizer for $12,000 a year. Why Chicago? Why not New York? He was already living in New York.:By 'chance' he met Antoin 'Tony' Rezko, born in Aleppo Syria, and a real estate developer in Chicago. Rezko has been convicted of fraud and bribery this year. Rezko, was named 'Entrepreneur of the Decade' by the Arab-American Business and Professional Association'. About two years later, Obama entered Harvard Law School. Do you have any idea what tuition is for Harvard Law School? Where did he get the money for Law School? More student loans? After Law school, he went back to Chicago. Rezko offered him a job, which he turned down. But, he did take a job with Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland. Guess what? They represented 'Rezar' which Rezko's firm. Rezko was one of Obama's first major financial contributors when he ran for office in Chicago. In 2003, Rezko threw an early fundraiser for Obama which Chicago Tribune reporter David Mendelland claims was instrumental in providing Obama with 'seed money' for his U.S. Senate race. In 2005, Obama purchased a new home in Kenwoood District of Chicago for $1.65 million (less than asking price). With ALL those Student Loans - Where did he get the money for the property? On the same day Rezko's wife, Rita, purchased the adjoining empty lot for full price. The London Times reported that Nadhmi Auchi, an Iraqi-born Billionaire loaned Rezko $3.5 million three weeks before Obama's new home was purchased. Obama met Nadhmi Auchi many times with Rezko.:All of the above information I got on line. If you would like to check it - Wikipedia, encyclopedia, Barack Obama; Tony Rezko; Valerie Jarrett: Daily Times - Obama visited Pakistan in 1981; The Washington Times - September 7, 2008; The Times May 10, 2008.Now the BIG question - If I found out all this information on my own, Why haven't all of our 'intelligent' members of the press been reporting this?A phrase that keeps ringing in my ear - 'Beware of the enemy from within'!!!   Variations:   Versions of this item circulated in 2012 were prefaced with an added line stating that it was ""written by a female Obama supporter who voted for him for president.""  That statement is inaccurate, as this item originally appeared prior to the 2008 presidential election.Origins:    The above-quoted piece combines a good deal of supposition and some elaborate conspiracy theory to question exactly where Senator Barack Obama obtained the money for his education and the purchase of a house in Chicago in 2005.  The answers are fairly straightforward.:As both Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, have noted many times, they paid for their educations via scholarships and student loans, in the process (like many people) incurring debts which were not fully paid off until many years later.  (In the Obamas' case, it was largely the revenue derived from Barack's pair of best-selling books that finally allowed them to retire their student loan debts.)Likewise, the Obamas' financing of their house in Chicago was no mystery.  The couple experienced a significant jump in income from 2000 onwards (largely from royalties on book sales), and they purchased their Chicago home in 2005, a year in which their combined income was $1.6 million:The Obamas' best financial year came in 2005, when their total combined income was $1.6 million. That included $1.2 million in author fees for Obama's best-selling books. Michelle Obama's salary that year [as vice president for community and external affairs at the University of Chicago Hospitals] was $316,962 plus another $45,000 from TreeHouse Foods [for whom she served a member of the board of directors].The copies of the Obamas' federal tax returns made available on the Internet show that the couple had an adjusted gross income of $207,647 in 2004, $1,655,106 in 2005, and $983,826 in 2006.:During the summer of 1981, Barack Obama traveled to Indonesia to see his mother and half-sister and went on to visit Pakistan with a college friend.  (There is no evidence that, as claimed above, he also went ""off to Africa to visit his father's family"" on that same trip.)  Since Obama had relatives and friends to stay with during that time, his only major expense would have been airplane fare, and it's not much of a stretch to believe that cost could have been covered by contributions from relatives and earnings from various summer jobs he held before and during his time at Occidental College.As for why Barack Obama went to work as a community organizer in Chicago rather than New York (where he was currently living), he stated quite plainly in Dreams from My Father that he had made multiple efforts to find employment in that field without success and ""had all but given up on organizing"" when he received a job offer from Chicago-based social activist Jerry Kellman after responding to a help wanted ad in the New York Times.It is true that Tony Rezko's wife, Rita Rezko, bought an undeveloped lot adjacent to the Obamas' home (at a time when Tony Rezko was under investigation by U.S. attorneys) and subsequently sold the Obamas a small portion of that lot, but (as noted above) the house was well within the Obamas' price range given their current income level and they would have required no help from the Rezkos (or anyone else) to afford it: :In June 2005, Obama and Rezko purchased adjoining parcels in Kenwood. The state's junior senator paid $1.65 million for a Georgian revival mansion, while Rezko paid $625,000 for the adjacent, undeveloped lot. Both closed on their properties on the same day.In January [2006], aiming to increase the size of his sideyard, Obama paid Rezko $104,500 for a strip of his land.As Senator Obama explained to the Chicago Sun-Times, the timing of the real estate purchases was dictated by the seller, and the prices were based on current market conditions and competing offers for the properties:Q: Have you or your wife ever done any legal work ever for Rezko or his companies?A: No.Q: How do you explain the fact your family purchased your home the same day as Rita Rezko bought the property adjacent to yours? Was this a coordinated purchase?A: The sellers required the closing of both properties at the same time. As they were moving out of town, they wished to conclude the sale of both properties simultaneously. The lot was purchased first; with the purchase of the house on the adjacent lot, the closings could proceed and did, on the same day, pursuant to the condition set by the sellers.:Q: Why is it that you were able to buy your parcel for $300,000 less than the asking price, and Rita Rezko paid full price? Who negotiated this end of the deal? Did whoever negotiated it have any contact with Rita and Tony Rezko or their Realtor or lawyer?A: Our agent negotiated only with the seller's agent. As we understood it, the house had been listed for some time, for months, and our offer was one of two and, as we understood it, it was the best offer. The original listed price was too high for the market at the time, and we understood that the sellers, who were anxious to move, were prepared to sell the house for what they paid for it, which is what they did.We were not involved in the Rezko negotiation of the price for the adjacent lot. It was our understanding that the owners had received, from another buyer, an offer for $625,000 and that therefore the Rezkos could not have offered or purchased that lot for less.Last updated:   1 May 2012Sources::     Davidson, Phil.

300,300,48.WhyDoMassShootingsSp,"This article about conspiracy theories around mass shootings is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.While conspiracy theories are not limited to any topic, there is one type of event that seems particularly likely to spark them: mass shootings, typically defined as attacks in which a shooter kills at least four other people.When one person kills many others in a single incident, particularly when it seems random, people naturally seek out answers for why the tragedy happened. After all, if a mass shooting is random, anyone can be a target. Pointing to some nefarious plan by a powerful group - such as the government - can be more comforting than the idea that the attack was the result of a disturbed or mentally ill individual who obtained a firearm legally.:In the United States, where some significant portion of the public believes that the government is out to take their guns, the idea that a mass shooting was orchestrated by the government in an attempt to make guns look bad may be appealing both psychologically and ideologically.Our studies of mass shootings and conspiracy theories help to shed some light on why these events seem particularly prone to the development of such theories and what the media can do to limit the ideas' spread.Back to the 1990sMass shootings and conspiracy theories have a long history. As far back as the mid-1990s, amid a spate of school shootings, Cutting Edge Ministries, a Christian fundamentalist website, found a supposed connection between the attacks and then-President Bill Clinton.The group's website claimed that when lines were drawn between groups of school-shooting locations across the U.S., they crossed in Hope, Arkansas, Clinton's hometown. The Cutting Edge Ministries concluded from this map that the ""shootings were planned events, with the purpose of convincing enough Americans that guns are an evil that needs to be dealt with severely, thus allowing the Federal Government to achieve its Illuminist goal of seizing all weapons."":Beliefs persist today that mass shootings are staged events, complete with ""crisis actors,"" people who are paid to pretend to be victims of a crime or disaster, all as part of a conspiracy by the government to take away people's guns. The idea has been linked to such tragedies as the 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, and the Sandy Hook Elementary attack that resulted in the deaths of 20 children in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012.These beliefs can become widespread when peddled by prominent people. U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has been in the news recently because of her belief that the Parkland shooting was a ""false flag,"" an event that was disguised to look like another group was responsible. It's not clear, though, in this instance who Rep. Greene felt was really to blame. Conservative personality Alex Jones recently failed to persuade the Texas Supreme Court to dismiss defamation and injury lawsuits against him by parents of children who were killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting. Jones has, for years, claimed that the Sandy Hook massacre didn't happen, saying ""the whole thing was fake,"" and alleging it happened at the behest of gun-control groups and complicit media outlets.:After the country's deadliest mass shooting to date, with 59 dead and hundreds injured in Las Vegas in 2017, the pattern continued: A conspiracy theory arose that there were multiple shooters, and the notion that the shooting was really done for some other purpose than mass murder.:A parent is reunited with a child in Newtown, Connecticut, after the 2012 school shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School.AP Photo/Jessica HillMaking sense of the senselessThese conspiracy theories are all attempts to make sense of incomprehensibly terrifying events. If a lone shooter, with no clear motive, can singlehandedly take the lives of 60 individuals, while injuring hundreds more, then is anyone really safe? Conspiracy theories are a way of understanding information. Historian Richard Hofstadter has indicated they can provide motives for events that defy explanation. Mass shootings, then, create an opportunity for people to believe there are larger forces at play, or an ultimate cause that explains the event. For instance, an idea that a shooter was driven mad by antipsychotic drugs, distributed by the pharmaceutical industry, can provide comfort as opposed to the thought that anyone can be a victim or perpetrator.:Polls have shown that people worry a lot about mass shootings, and more than 30% of Americans said in 2019 that they refused to go particular places such as public events or the mall for fear of being shot. If the shootings are staged, or the results of an enormous, unknowable or mysterious effort, then they at least becomes somewhat comprehensible. That thought process satisfies the search for a reason that can help people feel more comfort and security in a complex and uncertain world - especially when the reason found either removes the threat or makes it somehow less random. Some people blame mass shootings on other factors like mental illness that make gun violence an individual issue, not a societal one, or say these events are somehow explained by outside forces. These ideas may seem implausible to most, but they do what conspiracy theories are intended to do: provide people with a sense of knowing and control.Conspiracy theories have consequences:Conspiracy theories can spark real-world threats - including the QAnon-inspired attack on a pizza restaurant in 2016 and the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection.They also misdirect blame and distract from efforts to better understand tragedies such as mass shootings. High-quality scholarship could investigate how to better protect public places. But robust debates about how to reduce events such as mass shootings will be less effective if some significant portion of the public believes they are manufactured.Some journalists and news organizations have already started taking steps to identify and warn audiences against conspiracy theories. Open access to reputable news sources on COVID-19, for example, has helped manage the misinformation of coronavirus conspiracies. Explicit and clear evaluation of evidence and sources - in headlines and TV subtitles - have helped keep news consumers alert. And pop-up prompts from Twitter and Facebook encourage users to read articles before reposting.:These steps can work, as shown by the substantial drop in misinformation on Twitter following former President Donald Trump's removal from the platform.Mass shootings may be good fodder for conspiracy theories, but that does not mean people should actually consume such ideas without necessary context or disclaimers.:Michael Rocque, Associate Professor of Sociology, Bates College and Stephanie Kelley-Romano, Associate Professor of Rhetoric, Film, and Screen Studies, Bates CollegeThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

What's FalseLieber's arrest had nothing to do with the novel coronavirus, nor was that virus ""developed"" or ""manufactured"" by anyone (in China or elsewhere).:Editor's Note: On Dec. 22, 2021, Charles Lieber was convicted of making false statements to federal authorities about his involvement with the Chinese government and for failing to report foreign financial accounts to the IRS. You can read more about Lieber's case here. The original story continues below. On Jan. 28, 2020, Harvard professor Charles Lieber was arrested and charged with making a materially false statement to federal authorities about receiving funding from China.Lieber's arrest was big news in academic circles; but after internet users noticed that the alleged funding was coming from a university in Wuhan, China, the center of an outbreak of a new coronavirus, wild speculation went viral and unfounded connections were drawn between Lieber and a conspiracy theory that the coronavirus was a lab-made bioweapon.    :A viral Facebook post took it further, relaying more details about Lieber's arrest and making use of some conveniently placed scare quotes:In case you missed it, today, Federal Agents arrested Dr. Charles Lieber, chair of Harvard University's Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, with lying to the Department of Defense about secret monthly payments of $50,000.00 paid by China and receipt of millions more to help set up a chemical/biological ""Research"" laboratory in China. Also arrested were two Chinese ""Students"" working as research assistants, one of whom was actually a lieutenant in the Chinese Army, the other captured at Logan Airport as he tried to catch a flight to China - smuggling 21 vials of ""Sensitive Biological Samples"" according to the FBI.Oh, almost forgot. The research lab the good professor had helped set up? It's located at the Wuhan University of Technology. Wuhan China is ground zero to the potentially global pandemic known as the ""Coronavirus""which is both spreading rapidly and killing people.This is Stephen Coonts international spy novel stuff happening in real life - and it has barely made the news.:The claims made in this Facebook post are generally true. Lieber was truly arrested in January 2020 for lying to federal agents about funding he had allegedly received from China. However, Lieber's arrest was not connected to the coronavirus and there's no evidence to support claims that this disease was a human-made bioweapon.Let's take a closer look and separate the facts from the rumors in this case.Why was Charles Lieber arrested?In short: Lieber was arrested for lying to authorities about his involvement with a Chinese government program to recruit and cultivate scientific talent. Lieber was the Chair of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University and the Principal Investigator of the Lieber Research Group. Because this group had received grant funding from National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Department of Defense (DOD), Lieber was required to disclose any funding he received from foreign governments or entities that could lead to a conflict of interest. :The Department of Justice (DOJ) alleges in its complaint that Lieber became a ""strategic scientist"" at Wuhan University in 2011 and that he was a contractual participant in China's Thousand Talents Plan, a government program aimed at recruiting and cultivating high-level scientific talent.The DOJ says that Lieber was arrested for lying to investigators about his involvement in this program and his affiliations with WUT:China's Thousand Talents Plan is one of the most prominent Chinese Talent recruit plans that are designed to attract, recruit, and cultivate high-level scientific talent in furtherance of China's scientific development, economic prosperity and national security. These talent programs seek to lure Chinese overseas talent and foreign experts to bring their knowledge and experience to China and reward individuals for stealing proprietary information. Under the terms of Lieber's three-year Thousand Talents contract, WUT paid Lieber $50,000 USD per month, living expenses of up to 1,000,000 Chinese Yuan (approximately $158,000 USD at the time) and awarded him more than $1.5 million to establish a research lab at WUT. In return, Lieber was obligated to work for WUT ""not less than nine months a year"" by ""declaring international cooperation projects, cultivating young teachers and Ph.D. students, organizing international conference[s], applying for patents and publishing articles in the name of"" WUT.:The complaint alleges that in 2018 and 2019, Lieber lied about his involvement in the Thousand Talents Plan and affiliation with WUT. On or about, April 24, 2018, during an interview with investigators, Lieber stated that he was never asked to participate in the Thousand Talents Program, but he ""wasn't sure"" how China categorized him. In November 2018, NIH inquired of Harvard whether Lieber had failed to disclose his then-suspected relationship with WUT and China's Thousand Talents Plan. Lieber caused Harvard to falsely tell NIH that Lieber ""had no formal association with WUT"" after 2012, that ""WUT continued to falsely exaggerate"" his involvement with WUT in subsequent years, and that Lieber ""is not and has never been a participant in"" China's Thousand Talents Plan.Were two students arrested, one of whom was a lieutenant in the Chinese army, with 21 vials of ""sensitive biological samples?""In short: The DOJ announced three separate arrests in January 2020. The first was Lieber. The second involved Yanqing Ye, a lieutenant in the Chinese army accused of stealing U.S. research. And third was Zaosong Zheng, who stole 21 vials of biological research. While these three arrests all involve people lying about their ties to China, they took place at different universities and are not related. :On Jan. 28, 2020, the DOJ announced the arrests of three different individuals in three separate cases related to China. Dr. Charles Lieber, 60, Chair of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University, was arrested this morning and charged by criminal complaint with one count of making a materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statement. Lieber will appear this afternoon before Magistrate Judge Marianne B. Bowler in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts.Yanqing Ye, 29, a Chinese national, was charged in an indictment today with one count each of visa fraud, making false statements, acting as an agent of a foreign government and conspiracy. Ye is currently in China.Zaosong Zheng, 30, a Chinese national, was arrested on Dec. 10, 2019, at Boston's Logan International Airport and charged by criminal complaint with attempting to smuggle 21 vials of biological research to China. On Jan. 21, 2020, Zheng was indicted on one count of smuggling goods from the United States and one count of making false, fictitious or fraudulent statements. He has been detained since Dec. 30, 2019.:Yanqinq Ye, a lieutenant of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), the armed forces of the People's Republic of China and member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), reportedly lied about being a ""student"" on her visa in order to attend Boston University. The DOJ alleges that Ye conducted research and assessed military websites while studying at BU's Department of Physics, Chemistry and Biomedical Engineering and sent U.S. documents and information to China.Zaosong Zheng was arrested at Logan Airport as he was attempting to smuggle 21 vials of biological research that he allegedly stole from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. What was in the 21 vials?In short: Cancer cells. As news of Zheng's arrest circulated on social media, some made the unfounded claim that these vials of ""biological research"" were somehow connected to the coronavirus. According to The New York Times, however, these vials contained cancer cells::Inside his checked luggage, wrapped in a plastic bag and then inserted into a sock, the officers found what they were looking for: 21 vials of brown liquid -- cancer cells -- that the authorities say Mr. Zheng, 29, a cancer researcher, took from a laboratory at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.While some conspiracy theorists assumed that Zheng's plan involved a bio-weapon, Zheng told authorities that he planned on using the samples to further his career:Under questioning, court documents say, Mr. Zheng acknowledged that he had stolen eight of the samples and had replicated 11 more based on a colleague's research. When he returned to China, he said, he would take the samples to Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital and turbocharge his career by publishing the results in China, under his own name.Is coronavirus a man-made bio-weapon?:In short: There is no evidence that coronavirus was human-made and several leading researchers have debunked this notion. While this conspiracy theory has started to receive some mainstream attention (it was even pushed by Republican Sen. Tom Cotton), there is no evidence to support this claim. In fact, several researchers have debunked this claim, calling it illogical and noting that the current evidence indicates that the coronavirus mutated naturally.Trevor Bedford of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle stated at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Seattle that ""There is no evidence whatsoever of genetic engineering that we can find. The evidence we have is that the mutations [in the virus] are completely consistent with natural evolution.""Two more researchers gave statements to The Washington Post::""There's absolutely nothing in the genome sequence of this virus that indicates the virus was engineered,"" said Richard Ebright, a professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University. ""The possibility this was a deliberately released bioweapon can be firmly excluded.""Vipin Narang, an associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said it is ""highly unlikely"" the general population was exposed to a virus through an accident at a lab.""We don't have any evidence for that,"" said Narang, a political science professor with a background in chemical engineering.""It's a skip in logic to say it's a bioweapon that the Chinese developed and intentionally deployed, or even unintentionally deployed,"" Narang saidWas Charles Lieber's arrest related to the coronavirus?In short: No. Lieber's arrest (as well as the two other cases) was related to economic and academic espionage. There's no indication that Lieber's research, arrest, or connection to China was related to the spread of the coronavirus.:Lieber was arrested in January 2020 for allegedly working with a university in China to further the country's recruitment and development of scientific talent. While Lieber was reportedly working with a lab in Wuhan, China (it should be noted that Lieber allegedly started working with the Wuhan University of Technology 9 years before there would be an outbreak of coronavirus in the area), there's no evidence to suggest that this is anything more than a coincidence. Lieber's arrest, as well as the two other cases brought by the DOJ in January 2020, dealt with an academic battle between the U.S. and China. Lieber was allegedly working with a Chinese recruitment program, Ye was allegedly attempting to steal United States research and documents, and Zheng's was attempting to steal biological samples.FBI Boston Division Special Agent in Charge Joseph R. Bonavolonta said in a statement that all three of these cases dealt with ""economic espionage"" and China's attempts to steal trade secrets:China's goal, simply put, is to replace the United States as the world's leading superpower, and they're breaking the law to get there.:Massachusetts is a target-rich environment with world-class academic institutions, research facilities, hospitals, cleared defense contractors, and start-ups. And each and every one of them are in danger of having their research, development, and investments stolen right out from under them.The ruling Communist Party of the PRC wants what we have so they can get the upper hand on us.And while we are still confronted with traditional spies seeking our state secrets, often working under diplomatic cover, or posing as everyday citizens, I can tell you China is also using what we call ""non-traditional collectors"" such as professors, researchers, hackers and front companies.All three individuals charged today are manifestations of the China threat ...Make no mistake, the ruling Communist Party of the People's Republic of China is highly strategic in their approach, and we are deeply concerned about American innovation, research, and cutting-edge technologies ending up in the wrong hands ...:Economic espionage and the theft of trade secrets significantly hurts our academic institutions, businesses, jobs, and consumers, resulting in hundreds of billions of dollars in losses every year.While some may find these arrests to be suspect, the Department of Justice made no mention of coronavirus or biological warfare in their complaints."
302,302,28.2017sBiggestConspira,"The year 2017 saw conspiracy theories continue their migration from street-corner shouting to mainstream popular culture: the theories were everywhere, spouted by everyone, and were about everything. A rapper tried to crowdsource a satellite to prove the Earth was flat, new files pertaining to the Kennedy assassination were released over five decades later, and no less than the President of the United States spent Thanksgiving weekend tweeting a conspiracy theory chart that tied the Pope, organ harvesting, and a secret space program together.To better evaluate what truly leapt off social media and had the most mainstream impact, we looked at some of the conspiracy theories and rumors seemed to move the most readers.The truth, whatever it is, is out there.HurricanesWhen a series of historically massive hurricanes hit the United States during August and September, conspiracy theories and hoaxes followed close behind.:One popular -- and ancient -- theory accuses the United States of engaging in ""weather warfare"" by using the Alaska-based High-Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) to create them. HAARP is another frequent conspiracy theory bugaboo, supposedly involved in everything from making hurricanes to mind control.Skeptics point out that HAARP is a low-frequency transmitter that has no power to make hurricanes or enslave minds. Beyond that, HAARP is no longer a government facility, having been donated to the University of Alaska Fairbanks in 2015. Presumably, if HAARP was a devastating weapon of weather war, the government wouldn't just give it away.:On the other side of the spectrum, one conservative commentator tried to write the storms off as fake news, trumped up to push a climate change agenda and sell bottled water. This was the theory pushed by Rush Limbaugh, who claimed Hurricane Irma was far weaker than initial reports claimed -- only to evacuate himself a few days later.Las Vegas ShootingAfter a man on the Las Vegas Strip opened fire on 1 October 2017, killing nearly 60 people and injuring hundreds more, rumors immediately began flying: one held that there were multiple shooters firing from several floors, another that the security guard was an accomplice (which culminated in far-right self-described reporters banging on his door, camping out in front of his house, and ultimately reporting, completely falsely, that he had gone missing), and yet another, as happens with all mass shootings in the United States, that the incident was a hoax featuring paid actors posing as victims in an effort to take away gun rights.:All of these were quickly debunked, though the shooter's motive remains a mystery. A month later, the Clark County Sheriff told the Los Angeles Times that the shooter was a high-rolling gambler who had lost a ""significant amount of wealth,"" and had shown growing signs of mental instability. Even so, conspiracy theories continue to make the rounds, including one alleging that survivors of the shooting are being systematically murdered.AntifaConspiracy theories have linked the anti-fascist activists known as ""antifa"" to a number of violent acts that either didn't take place at all, or that had nothing to do with the activists.One rumor that went far and wide was sparked by a viral video made by an amateur bounty hunter wearing an iron-on patch on his sweatshirt that vaguely resembled a law enforcement badge.  He predicted (completely wrongly) that antifa ""super-soldiers"" would go house to house on 4 November 2017, stealing guns and killing white people in the name of resisting Trump.:Conspiracy theorists also linked antifa to both the Las Vegas shooting and the mass shooting in Texas a month later, despite no evidence existing that either shooter was part of any anti-fascist movement -- or even sympathized with them.Online commentators also tried to connect a train derailment near Olympia, Washington, to an eight-month-old blog post by a self-proclaimed Antifa group that said they had poured concrete on train tracks 15 miles away from the scene of the accident. As it turned out, the train had been traveling nearly three times the speed limit as it went around a dangerous curve.:BitcoinIt shouldn't be surprising that the online crypto-currency Bitcoin is a prolific generator of rumors and scams. After all, nobody knows who developed it, few people understand how it works, and its value swings wildly due to nebulous factors controlled by unknown forces. This means, of course, that it's a topic that's ripe for conspiracy theories.:So what's really going on here? As Bitcoin value soared, one financialanalystwrote:Governments are currently in the process of vetting the cryptocurrency space and using bitcoin as its primary test case ... before crushing private cryptocurrencies altogether, then replacing them with one government-sanctioned ""bitcoin.""Other popular Bitcoin conspiracy theories in 2017: that its mysterious inventor is actually the NSA or Elon Musk, that an advanced artificial intelligence created it to take over the world, and that a few ""whales"" are hoarding Bitcoin to drive up the value of their own holdings.  But the most likely explanation for high Bitcoin value is that it's a hype-driven bubble that will level off once the public moves on -- a speculative asset craze that's taken place many other times in history.Obama's Shadow Government:Is Barack Obama controlling a ""deep state"" of bureaucrats and intelligence officials running a mini government to take down the Trump administration?That's the thinking behind an ""Obama shadow government"" working to destroy Trump. Conservative pundits and politicians have freely accused the former president and his appointees of leaking embarrassing information, rigging the Russia investigation, and planning nothing less than a coup through the FBI to throw Trump out of office. There is no evidence for any of these claims.:Roy MooreThe shocking allegations that Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore either had or attempted sexual relations with numerous teenage girls were obvious fodder for conspiracy theories. They arose nearly instantaneously, holding that either the Washington Post was lying or Moore's accusers were, and that the yearbook signature Moore bestowed on one of the accusers was forged.:Soon, a fake tweet surfaced accusing Post journalists of offering a thousand dollars for accusations. Meanwhile, someone pretending to be a Post reporter (with an anti-Semitic fake name and a strange attempt at a New York accent) cold-called people in Alabama to offer money for damaging information about the candidate. Moore himself fueled the theorizing, speculating that financier (and favorite bugbear of conspiracy theorists everywhere) George Soros was ""trying to alter the voting populous"" through pushing a ""sexual"" agenda.Even after Moore lost the election, he leaned on conspiracy theories to explain the outcome, posting a Facebook message requesting money to investigate ""reported cases of voter fraud and irregularities."" Naturally, bottom-of-the-barrel conspiracy-mongering web sites immediately exploited that statement and others like it, publishing sensational (and completely false) ""scoops"" to bring in as many clicks and views as possible. Fake Melania:President Trump was a magnet for conspiracy theories both in opposition to and in support of his administration. But none summed up the ephemeral nature of internet conspiracies like the one claiming a Melania Trump body double had posed next to the President.The First Lady's lack of public appearances and seeming aloofness make her an easy subject for gossip and rumors. Sure enough, in October, a Facebook user posted that something seemed ""off"" about Melania's appearance as she stood next to the President during a quick appearance in front of reporters. Others then claimed that her nose, hair, and mouth looked different. Soon, social media was alight with rumors that Melania had been ""replaced"" by a decoy, either to help her avoid the spotlight, or because she'd split up with the president.:The theory relied on a few out-of-context low-quality images apparently taken by someone filming their television screen, and was quickly written off as cynical fake news. But for a few days it captured the attention of almost every major news outlet in the country, some of which covered it straight and others that pointed out how weird it was.In that regard, it was a perfect example of most of 2017's conspiracy theories: baseless, bizarre, and ultimately short-lived."
303,303,257.HarryReidChineseComp,"Claim:   Senator Harry Reid and a Chinese company building a solar plant are behind a standoff between federal agents and a Nevada rancher.FALSEExamples:   [Collected via Facebook, April 2014]Site are reporting that Harry Reid is in cahoots with ENN a Chinese firm for which his son works to take over the range area in dispute with that Nevada rancher and the Bureau of Land Management. Is there any truth here?  The Bundy Ranch in NV standoff with BLM is being attributed to Harry Reid's desire to help his son secure rights for a Chinese company to build a solar energy farm in the Nevada desert.It's making it's rounds on Facebook and, of course, the internet.   Origins:   April 2014 saw the publicizing of a decades-old dispute between the federal government and Cliven Bundy, a cattle rancher in Nevada, over grazing rights on public land. Back in 1993, Cliven Bundy began declining to pay the government fees required to allow his cattle to graze on public lands, and in 1998, as part of an effort to protect the endangered desert tortoise found in that area, the government obtained the issuance of a court order requiring Bundy to take his cows off that land.  In July 2013, a federal court finally ordered Bundy to get his cattle off public land within 45 days or risk having them confiscated by the government and sold to pay off the fees and trespassing fines (reportedly in excess of $1.2 million) that he owes::Bundy does not recognize federal authority over land where his ancestors first settled in the 1880s, which he claims belongs to the state of Nevada. The Bureau of Land Management [BLM] disagreed and took him to federal court, which first ruled in favor of the BLM in 1998. After years of attempts at a negotiated settlement over the $1.2 million Bundy owes in fees failed, federal land agents began seizing hundreds of his cattle illegally grazing on public land.Bundy's claim that the land belongs to Nevada or Clark County didn't hold up in court, nor did his claim of inheriting an ancestral right to use the land that pre-empts the BLM's role.As Bundy did not comply with the court order, the confiscation of his cattle began in April 2014, precipitating a tense standoff between Bundy's supporters and law enforcement officials. (The government eventually relented and released about 400 head of cattle it had seized from Bundy.)Somewhere along the way in the reporting of this brouhaha, the conspiracy theory arose that the showdown between Cliven Bundy and the federal government wasn't really about grazing cattle or endangered tortoises, but was actually about a deal between Harry Reid, the senior U.S. Senator from Nevada (and the current U.S. Majority Leader), and a Chinese company eager to build a solar plant on the disputed land::As a family in Clark County, Nev. continues to face an onslaught of heavily armed federal agents determined to kick them off of their ranch, reports have surfaced that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid might be behind the entire ordeal.The ranch, which has been in Cliven Bundy's family for more than a century, is ground zero for a growing showdown between federal authorities and individual rights activists.Reid and his eldest son, reports indicate, were integral in the support and/or implementation of a $5 billion solar plant being built in the county by a Chinese company.Reid has been outspoken in support of the government's position on the Bundy issue, and both he and his son Rory were in earlier years prominent advocates of efforts by ENN Mojave Energy LLC (a Chinese-backed company) to build a solar plant in Clark County:Questions surrounding family ties are flaring again in Nevada around the Senate majority leader. He and his oldest son, Rory, are both involved in an effort by a Chinese energy giant, ENN Energy Group, to build a $5 billion solar farm and panel manufacturing plant in the southern Nevada desert.Reid has been one of the project's most prominent advocates, helping recruit the company during a 2011 trip to China and applying his political muscle on behalf of the project in Nevada. His son, a lawyer with a prominent Las Vegas firm that is representing ENN, helped it locate a 9,000-acre (3,600-hectare) desert site that it is buying well below appraised value from Clark County, where Rory Reid formerly chaired the county commission.:However, the theory that Reid's putative involvement in the Bundy dispute was motivated by a desire to somehow profit from the building of a solar plant falls flat in the face of two basic facts: The site that ENN Mojave Energy was planning to buy in order to build a solar plant is nowhere near the public land Bundy has been disputing with the government, and ENN gave up the solar project and terminated its agreement to buy land to house it as far back as June 2013:A Chinese-backed company is pulling the plug on a multibillion-dollar solar project near Laughlin after it was unable to find customers for the power that would have been generated there, a Clark County spokesman said.In a letter, an executive from ENN Mojave Energy LLC informed the county that the company was terminating its agreement to purchase 9,000 acres near Laughlin, stating that the ""market will not support a project of this scale and nature at this time.""The company, a subsidiary of ENN Group, described as the largest energy company in China, said it was unable to sign the necessary power purchase agreements to sell the energy generated from the solar plant to utilities in Nevada or neighboring states.The project was broken down into phases, but if fully completed, it was expected to generate enough energy to power 200,000 homes with a price tag of $1 billion to $6 billion.:The move was hailed as a much-needed boost for economic development in the southern part of the state and was projected to create up to 2,200 permanent jobs.Commissioners agreed to sell the land at $4.5 million -- about a sixth of its appraised value -- in December 2011 to jump-start the development, but they put in place an aggressive timeline that required ENN to secure the complicated power purchase agreements.With the solar project now just a mirage, commissioners will discuss what to do with the 9,000 acres of county-owned land at their July 2 meeting.Even the conservative Breitbart site debunked this conspiracy claim, noting:Despite the obvious partisan gain to be had if Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's son Rory (a failed 2010 Nevada gubernatorial candidate) had somehow been involved in a ""land grab"" affecting the Bundy family ranch operation -- the facts just do not pan out as such. Indeed, Rory Reid did in fact have a hand in plans to reclassify federal lands for renewable energy developments. Just northeast of Las Vegas and Nellis Air Force Base, plans were drawn by Reid allies to potentially develop 5,717 acres of land for such use. While it would be fair to claim that such activity was in Bundy's relative neighborhood, the federal lands once leased by the family were more than 20 miles away, east of Overton, Nevada.:Some versions of this conspiracy theory mistake the proposed ENN Mojave Energy site with that of the Moapa Southern Paiute Solar project, but the latter's 250MW solar power plant is already under construction (so there is no need to grab land for it), and, as noted in Wildlife News, the Moapa plant is being built near the Moapa Indian Reservation and not on public land disputed by Cliven Bundy:A cursory search shows a sudden explosion of articles claiming Nevada's senior senator, Harry Reid, wants Bundy's land (all Bundy actually owns is a melon farm) to build a solar plant to enrich himself and his son. Bundy has been trespassing over 750,000 acres of U.S. public land to the south of Mesquite and Bunkerville, Nevada. Bundy's actual private property is his melon farm at Bunkerville, which looks like maybe 100 acres on Google Earth.  There is a solar farm. But it is not on the huge swath of land Bundy is trespassing on. The solar facility is actually under construction near the Moapa Indian Reservation about ten miles closer to Las Vegas.Likewise, another area currently being studied by BLM for the possible development of solar plants, commonly known as the Dry Lake Solar Energy Zone, is sometimes mistakenly thrown into the conspiracy theory mix by persons who point to a BLM report listing ""Cattle Trespass Impacts"" and claim that it documents the BLM's intent to use the disputed land for solar development::Non-Governmental Organizations have expressed concern that the regional mitigation strategy for the Dry Lake Solar Energy Zone utilizes Gold Butte as the location for offsite mitigation for impacts from solar development, and that those restoration activities are not durable with the presence of trespass cattle.But as explained at the Wildlife News, that isn't what the quoted blurb means:There is some feeble effort to try to mitigate the damage to wildlife [caused by solar development]. Some of it is near the sites of these solar mirrors. This is called ""primary mitigation."" Some is in a place distant to the solar power site. This is called ""secondary mitigation.""  Wildlife mitigation is things like planting grass wildlife need or like, development of new water sources for wildlife to drink, and restoration of rangeland overgrazed by cattle.All this bureaucratic language means is that private groups like the Western Watersheds Project,  Friends of Nevada Wilderness, Friends of Gold Butte and Friends of Joshua Tree Forest don't think the damage from solar power plants located elsewhere can be mitigated at Gold Butte because the cattle will tromp all over it.Last updated:    14 April 2014Sources::     Camia, Catalina.

304,304,493.IsChristineBlaseyFor,"Claim:Christine Blasey Ford's attorney, Debra Katz, serves as vice chair for a ""Soros-funded organization"" that opposes the Supreme Court confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh.Rating:MixtureAbout this rating What's TrueAn organization for which Christine Blasey Ford's attorney, Debra Katz, serves as vice chair receives funding from George Soros's Open Society Foundation.What's FalseThe organization that Katz vice chairs, the Project on Government Oversight, has dozens of funding sources (including conservative donors) and is a non-partisan government accountability non-profit which has not taken a position supporting or opposing Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation.:National events have a tendency to draw out conspiracy theories about billionaire philanthropist George Soros, and the controversy over the U.S. Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh proved no different.Shortly after Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, a California college professor, came forward with allegations that Kavanaugh had attempted to rape her when the two were in high school, a menagerie of junk news sites and internet conspiracy theorists alike began to scour the web for ""links"" between her and  Soros. And because George Soros is the founder and chair of the Open Society Foundation, which donates to many varied organizations and causes, loose ""links"" were inevitably found. Many turned out to be bogus, and even one that was based on some accurate information was spun in a misleading way.On 17 September 2018, Frontpage Mag, a web site operated by the ultra-conservative David Horowitz Freedom Center, reported in a headline that ""KAVANAUGH ACCUSER'S LAWYER IS VICE CHAIR OF SOROS FUNDED ORG OPPOSING KAVANAUGH""::Kavanaugh's accuser is being represented by Debra Katz, a Washington D.C., lawyer and the vice chair of the board of the Project On Government Oversight.POGO co-signed a letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein and Senator Grassley along with a variety of lefty groups demanding Kavanaugh records. This was the obstruction tactic of choice of the left for trying to secure the Court seat before they fastened on to this latest smear.Where does PGO gets its funding?From, among other sources, George Soros and his Open Society Foundation tentacles.(The Frontpage Mag story was the source for a subsequent, widely-quoted opinion piece published by the Washington Times, which more or less rehashed it with an extra helping of Soros paranoia.)It's true that Debra Katz has served as an attorney for Dr. Ford,  and she has indeed also served for years as vice chair of the board for the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit that advocates for government transparency and accountability. But claims about the organization's funding and position on Kavanaugh's confirmation have been distorted.:POGO does receive some funding from the Open Society Foundation, but it also receives funding from a multitude of other sources as well. In 2016, POGO listed a donation in excess of $100,000 from the Open Society Foundation, while also reporting a donation of more than $25,000 from the conservative Charles Koch Foundation -- both relatively very small proportions of the more than $2.7 million in revenue the organization took in from all sources that year.It's also true that the organization signed on to an 8 August 2018 letter addressed to Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and ranking member Dianne Feinstein (D-California), requesting that all senators on the committee be given equal access to documents pertinent to the nominee and expressing concern that the Republican majority had been given preferential treatment. Other groups that signed the letter included the Campaign for Accountability, Human Rights Watch, the National Coalition Against Censorship, the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, and the National Security Archive.But POGO spokesman Tim Farnsworth told us POGO is non-partisan and has not taken a position supporting or opposing Kavanaugh's confirmation: ""I think it's ridiculous to use one funding source for the organization to draw a conspiracy, when we have over 50 foundations and grant makers supporting us,"" he said.:Farnsworth said Katz serves on the organization's board not because of any political views she may hold, but because as an attorney she specializes in representing and protecting government whistleblowers.We sent Frontpage Mag writer Daniel Greenfield questions about whether the headline was still accurate in light of POGO's rebuttal, why he used the term ""tentacle"" to describe Soros's charitable foundation activities, and why Katz's long-standing membership on POGO's board was considered newsworthy. He replied:A variety of Soros funded organizations have been highly active in the battle against Kavanaugh. It's therefore newsworthy that POGO has received funding from a politically influential billionaire whose activism has shaped and reshaped national politics. While POGO is officially non-partisan, it has signed on to a letter alongside heavily partisan groups that have taken a strong position against Kavanaugh intended to stymie his progress.Tentacle refers to the tendency of organizations funded by Soros to be politically and financially intertwined while serving common goals. This phenomenon has been noted in a variety of countries, some of which have targeted legislation against the politically influential billionaire.This entire discussion has been overtaken by current events. Ford now has a number of clear Democrat partisan figures around her making the debate over partisan leanings on this matter, moot.:Greenfield didn't explain why he didn't consider it equally newsworthy that POGO has also received funding from Charles Koch, a conservative politically influential billionaire whose activism has shaped and reshaped national politics, or use the word ""tentacle"" to describe Koch's charitable activities.Open Society Foundation spokeswoman Laura Silver told us the OSF works on behalf of public causes that promote increasing overall social equality and quality of life:The Open Society Foundations' work in the US is centered around four goals: promoting a more inclusive and accountable democracy; a fair criminal justice system; full political, economic and civic participation of communities of color and immigrants; and equitable economic growth.It's one of the largest programs in the foundations, and covers a lot of issues, as you might imagine. To give you a sampling, based on topics in the news these days: the foundations' US Programs staff works to end mass incarceration, advance voting rights, close the racial wealth gap; promote the rule of law, and address drug use through community- and health-based systems, rather than the criminal justice system.:The implications of invoking George Soros' name in relation to Dr. Ford is meant to imply that Ford was motivated to come forward solely for politically partisan reasons, but we found no evidence that is the case.The conspiratorial fixation with Soros often takes hold after mass casualty incidents: he is often the target of fantastical allegations that he orchestrates ""false flag"" events. It also becomes prominent when a political controversy sweeps the country, as with the Kavanaugh confirmation process. Because the causes that the Soros foundation supports are often progressive in nature, he's regularly invoked as right wing's boogeyman.  David Horowitz, for example authored a book entitled The Shadow Party: How George Soros, Hillary Clinton, and Sixties Radicals Seized Control of the Democratic Party, summarized thusly via online retailer Amazon:Radical infiltrators have been quietly transforming America's societal, cultural, and political institutions for more than a generation. Now, backed by George Soros, they are ready to make their move. These ""progressive"" extremists have gained control over a once-respectable but now desperate and dangerous political party. From their perches in the Democratic hierarchy, they seek to undermine the war on terror, destabilize the nation, and effect radical ""regime change"" in America.:As the Anti-Defamation League noted, the more extreme the source of the Soros conspiracy theory, the more likely it will take on an air of hate:In mainstream conservative discourse, Hungarian Jewish billionaire, Holocaust survivor and philanthropist George Soros is often portrayed as a potent force behind liberal and progressive causes. In far right circles, this belief often veers into outsized conspiracy theories, including claims that he directly funds specific protests or in other ways manipulates events to further his goals. These conspiracy theories sometimes take on an anti-Semitic cast, especially when they associate Soros' actions with his Jewish identity, incorporate elements of classic anti-Semitic tropes like control of governments, banks and media, or accuse him of orchestrating false flags events ..."

The meme proclaims that U.S. President ""Donald J. Trump was the man chosen by the military"" to control acts of terrorism domestically and that martial law would be invoked after Christmas:::This is not a real message from U.S. military generals to the public.Instead, as the QAnon conspiracy theory hashtag indicates at the bottom of the meme, it appears to be nothing more than fearmongering based on statements from some Trump supporters, who say they want Trump to use martial law to overturn the results of the November 2020 election, which he lost.Trump and his supporters have pushed an aggressive disinformation campaign, claiming falsely that the 2020 election was beset by widespread fraud and that it was Trump, not President-elect Joe Biden, who actually won.Trump's own U.S. Department of Homeland Security debunked this conspiracy theory, stating the November 2020 election was ""the most secure in American history."""
306,306,198.IstheAgeofConsentBei,"Claim:An effort is underway to lower the minimum age of consent for sexual activity to age 4.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In August 2020, social media users circulated the claim that some ""people"" were trying to lower the age of consent for sexual activity to the ridiculously young age of four: ""We can't buy alcohol or cigarettes until we are 21, but there are people trying to make legal age of consent 4 years old. Let that sink in. #SaveOurChildren."":The posts cited no source, referenced no location, nor identified what ""people"" were supposedly seeking this radical change in the law. Age of consent is decided on a state-by-state basis in the U.S. and ranges from 16 to 18 years old, and we found no evidence of any serious, concerted, or widespread effort in any state to modify the age of consent to encompass mere toddlers.Some commenters attempted to associate with claim with California's recently passed and controversial SB 145, but while that law allows certain individuals convicted of sex offenses involving minors to apply for discretionary relief from having to register as sex offenders, it does not in any way affect the age of consent in that state.The ""SaveOurChildren"" hashtag used in the example reproduced above was originally created to raise awareness of child sex trafficking, but it has since been ""co-opted by followers of QAnon, a sprawling conspiracy theory that pushes the idea that the Trump administration will take down an alleged global ring of pedophiles led by prominent Democrats."":"
307,307,172.TheresNoEvidenceIvan,"Claim:Ivana Trump was actually cremated and a casket supposedly for her was instead filled with several classified and top secret documents to keep them hidden from federal investigators.Rating:UnfoundedAbout this rating On Sept. 20, 2022, the word ""cremated"" began to trend on Twitter with an unfounded rumor about the death of Ivana Trump, former U.S. President Donald Trump's first ex-wife.:She died on July 14 and was buried six days later at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey. According to The New York Times, the ground at the golf club was ""consecrated so Ms. Trump could have a traditional Catholic burial.""One tweet asked, ""If Ivana was cremated, what was in the coffin?"" A different tweet included a picture of pallbearers carrying her casket and also claimed she had been cremated. We found no shortage of tweets that pushed this completely unsupported rumor that claimed she had been cremated.""If Ivana was cremated, then what actually IS in her grave?,"" another user tweeted on July 31. ""Anybody know the whereabouts of those 15 boxes of classified documents Trump stole?"":Donald and Ivana Trump attend the Eric Trump 8th Annual Golf Tournament at Trump National Golf Club in Westchester on Sept. 15, 2014, in Briarcliff Manor, New York. (Photo by Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images)Basically, this conspiracy theory about the death of Ivana Trump had two components for which there was no evidence: cremation (as opposed to an intact-body burial) and the stashing of secret documents in her supposed casket.In the weeks after her death, news broke that federal investigators had found hundreds of documents of various classifications including top secret on the property of the former president's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. The Associated Press reported that the documents belonged to the National Archives and Records Administration. Investigators also reportedly uncovered empty folders that originally contained high-level documents, which perhaps provided more fuel to the baseless rumors, apparently contending that the missing documents were stashed in the casket.In sum, no evidence has been presented to support the conspiracy theory that she was cremated, nor was there any proof that a casket supposedly for her instead contained additional secret documents beyond the hundreds that investigators had already uncovered. For these reasons, we have rated this claim as, ""Unfounded."":For further reading, we recommend Mike Rothschild's extensive, in-depth article on The Daily Dot, titled, ""Why Resistance Twitter still wants to dig up Ivana Trump's grave."" Rothschild called the rumors ""a perfect storm for an unceasing conspiracy."""

The caption for the tweet read, ""Nahh someone leaked the SuperBowl script."":According to the stats under the tweet, it had been seen more than 12 million times.However, as some users realized, this was simply a continuation of a sarcastic and comedic discussion that had occurred on a podcast in the days before the tweet went up.:In an episode of the ""Macrodosing: Arian Foster and PFT Commenter"" podcast from Barstool Sports, former NFL player Arian Foster had played along with a comedy bit about how the NFL was ""rigged"" and that he would receive ""scripts"" for how his seasons with the league would play out.SI.com reported, ""NFL Players React to Conspiracy Theory of a Scripted League,"" adding, ""If it's not apparent to the average listener, it's clear that Foster gave his account with his tongue firmly planted in his cheek."":For readers unable to listen to the clip, here's the transcript:PFT Commenter: It's funny. Before we started taping, Arian was telling me about how the NFL is rigged and how every year he used to get a script. Day one of training camp, it would get dropped off at his locker, and you would have to, you know, it was like, week one you'll do this, week two you're going to have a hamstring injury, week three this is gonna happen, week four you're going to get three touchdowns, and so, then you just have to, did you memorize those before the season started or would you go and rehearse the script before every game?Foster: Oh, we're really dedicated to it, so it was moreso like, that's what practice was about, it was about practicing the script. This is what goes on and this is what we have to do, in order to...PFT Commenter: And this referee's gonna miss this call because they hate you and they love the Colts, that sort of thing?Foster: Yeah, WWF, so it's like, you know what's gonna happen, but you still got to put on a show.:Big Tennessee: What did you think when you got the script in 2016 that said your career was going to fall off a cliff when you stopped belieiving in God?(laughing)Foster: That was 2015.From what we could gather, the person who created the score seen in the tweet had simply used as a template a page of previous game that had been published by pro-football-reference.com. For example, there was one game that ended 37-34 earlier in 2023. A few simple changes in the code of the page were all that were needed in order to produce the image.In the responses under the tweet, many of which asked the user who posted the image to scroll down and show the box score and coin toss outcome for betting purposes, we noticed that another user came up with their own final score of 112-3.:Of course, there's a possibility that the Eagles will defeat the Chiefs by the 37-34 score shown in the tweet. But again, the picture was simply meant as a joke."
309,309,180.APDiamondsCauseofDea,"The cause of death for Lynette ""Diamond"" Hardaway, formerly of the Diamond and Silk right-wing political duo, was heart disease due to chronic high blood pressure, according to a death certificate that was obtained and reported on by The Associated Press.She died on Jan. 8. Her death was announced on the following day by former U.S. President Donald Trump on his Truth Social platform.The AP reported that Hardaway's cause of death had initially ""become a topic of widespread speculation"" in connection with COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines:Hardaway and her sister, Rochelle ""Silk"" Richardson, found internet stardom as Black women who ardently backed Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign. After making several campaign appearances with the former president, the two leveraged their notoriety to land regular commentator roles at Fox News. Their promotion of coronavirus falsities eventually got them dropped, but they landed at the far-right cable and digital media platform Newsmax.The cause of Hardaway's death, which was not released by the family, had become a topic of widespread speculation. A torrent of social media users suggested COVID-19 was to blame.:While speaking at Hardaway's funeral on Jan. 21, Richardson, better known by the moniker of ""Silk,"" appeared to push a widely-debunked ""died suddenly"" conspiracy theory.In recent months, the usage of the two words ""died suddenly"" had become a way to push a rumor that posits, without credible evidence, that COVID-19 vaccines have increased incidences of people suddenly dying with little to no warning. (We previously reported two stories on the ""died suddenly"" conspiracy theory.)In a video from the funeral broadcast that was posted by Right Side Broadcasting Network (RSBN), Richardson used the word ""suddenly"" in relation to Hardaway's death at least three different times.At one point, she said, ""It's time to investigate what's really going on here, and get some answers to why people are falling dead suddenly."":Here's more of what Richardson said:As soon as Diamond hung up the phone, she said to me, ""I can't breathe."" It was suddenly, out of nowhere, and no warning....So what I want to say to everybody is don't you dare call me a conspiracy theorist, because I saw it happen. I saw how it happened. I was there when it happened, and it happened suddenly. I want America to wake up and pay attention. Something ain't right. It's time to investigate what's really going on here, and get some answers to why people are falling dead suddenly.The AP also noted that Richardson ""insinuated Hardaway may have been 'poisoned' by another person who had been vaccinated, amplifying the false notion that recipients can affect those around them.""Richardson's remarks resulted in a number of tweets from right-wing figures who have high follower counts.:For example, sometime ""pizzagate"" conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec posted a tweet that referenced Silk's comments about ""why people are suddenly dropping dead."" He also made mention of the fact that Trump was in attendance at the funeral.Right-wing activist Rogan O'Handley, whose account has a blue checkmark since he is subscribed to Twitter Blue for $8 per month, tweeted, ""This is horrible to watch. Diamond said she couldn't breathe and then died suddenly. Silk is demanding answers about the vaccine and what it did to her sister. Why does this keep happening?! Why do healthy Americans keep dying suddenly out of nowhere?!"":Further, Twitter user @DiedSuddenly_, also a Twitter Blue subscriber, used a syringe emoji as an apparent reference to vaccines when referencing Silk's remarks::However, again, the AP reported that Hardaway's death certificate said that she died of heart disease due to chronic high blood pressure.The publication also shared information about a tweet from November 2022 that asked for prayers for Diamond, as well as the following additional details:COVID-19 was not listed as a cause or contributing factor on her death certificate, which was provided to the AP by the Hoke County Register of Deeds and was signed by a local doctor. No autopsy was performed.This story will be updated if further information comes to light."
310,310,555.RUMORALERTDominionVo,"Claim:Various rumors alleging voter fraud focused on the Electronic voting company Dominion Voting Systems. On Nov. 7, 2020, the Associated Press, the New York Times, Fox News, and several other major news outlets called the 2020 presidential election and projected that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris had defeated U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. As news of President-elect Biden's victory spread on social media, so did unsupported claims alleging voter fraud. Many of these claims were centered around Dominion Voting Systems, a company that sells voting machines and software in the United States and Canada. We will examine a few of these claims below.Did a software glitch cause thousands of Republican votes to be marked for Democrats in Michigan? A human error resulted in a temporary miscalculation in Antrim County, Michigan, but this issue was quickly remedied.:One of the most prevalent voter fraud claims to emerge in the days following the election was the accusation that a computer glitch in a software program from Dominion Voting Systems had mistakenly counted thousands of votes for President Trump as votes for President Biden. This claim was based on a half-truth: a tabulation error did occur in Antrim County, but the problem was a result of a human error, and the mistake was quickly caught and corrected.Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson disputed claims of deliberate election fraud in a statement:In response to the false claims made by Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, the Michigan Department of State issues the following statements of fact:Michigan's elections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters.The erroneous reporting of unofficial results from Antrim county was a result of accidental error on the part of the Antrim County Clerk. The equipment and software did not malfunction and all ballots were properly tabulated. However, the clerk accidentally did not update the software used to collect voting machine data and report unofficial results.:Like many counties in Michigan, Antrim County uses the Dominion Voting Systems election management system and voting machines (ballot tabulators.) The county receives programming support from Election Source. Tabulators are programmed to scan hand marked, paper ballots. When machines are finished scanning the ballots, the paper ballots are retained and a totals tape showing the number of votes for each candidate in each race is printed from the machine.In order to report unofficial results, county clerks use election management system software to combine the electronic totals from tabulators and submit a report of unofficial results. Because the clerk did not update software, even though the tabulators counted all the ballots correctly, those accurate results were not combined properly when the clerk reported unofficial results.The correct results always were and continue to be reflected on the tabulator totals tape and on the ballots themselves. Even if the error in the reported unofficial results had not been quickly noticed, it would have been identified during the county canvass. Boards of County Canvassers, which are composed of 2 Democrats and 2 Republicans, review the printed totals tape from each tabulator during the canvass to verify the reported vote totals are correct.:The software did not cause a misallocation of votes; it was a result of user human error. Even when human error occurs, it is caught during county canvasses.It is also completely false that the county had to or will have to hand count all their ballots. The ballots were properly counted by the tabulators. The county had to review the printed tabulator results from each precinct, not each individual ballot.As with other unofficial results reporting errors, this was an honest mistake and did not affect any actual vote totals. Election clerks work extremely hard and do their work with integrity. They are human beings, and sometimes make mistakes. However, there are many checks and balances that ensure mistakes can be caught and corrected.On a related note, Benson also disputed claims that Republicans weren't allowed to observe the vote count, asserting that ""hundreds of challengers from both parties were inside their absent voter counting board all afternoon and evening.""What About Reports of Glitches in Georgia? :There were multiple claims that software ""glitches"" had resulted in the deletion of Trump votes, mainly in the states of Michigan (discussed above) and Georgia. But these claims are without merit.For starters, Dominion Voting Systems uses a combination of a touchscreen and a printed ballot. In other words, it's simply not possible to ""erase"" votes via a ""glitch"" as these votes are also recorded on paper ballots. Second, The New York Times investigated the various reports of ""glitches"" and found that in every instance there was a simple and detailed explanation. In Georgia, two of the ""glitch"" reports did not involve Dominion software. In the third, there was a brief delay in reporting vote tallies but this did not affect the count.The New York Times reported:Issues in three Georgia counties had other explanations. In one county, an apparent problem with Dominion software delayed officials' reporting of the vote tallies, but did not affect the actual vote count. In two other counties, a separate company's software slowed poll workers' ability to check-in voters.""Many of the claims being asserted about Dominion and questionable voting technology is misinformation at best and, in many cases, they're outright disinformation,"" said Edward Perez, an election-technology expert at the OSET Institute, a nonprofit that studies voting infrastructure. ""I'm not aware of any evidence of specific things or defects in Dominion software that would lead one to believe that votes had been recorded or counted incorrectly."":Georgia election officials said that there would be a ""pre-certification audit will provide additional confidence that the votes were accurately counted.""Did Dominion Voting Software Delete 2.7 Million Ballots Cast for Donald Trump? No, there's no evidence to support this claim and multiple election officials have disputed the accusations. While voter fraud claims concerning Dominion Voting Software started on the fringes on the internet, they officially went mainstream on Nov. 12, 2020 when U.S. President Donald Trump posted a message on Twitter claiming that Dominion had deleted 2.7 million votes that had cast for the incumbent. :There is no truth to this claim. This rumor has even been disputed by government officials in Trump's Department of Homeland Security. Shortly after Trump issued this tweet, a coalition of election security officials issued a joint statement saying that ""there is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised."" We took a deeper dive into this claim here. Does the Clinton Foundation Partner with Dominion Voting Systems? The evidence provided does not support this claim.Some social media users alleged that Dominion Voting Systems had somehow rigged the election, and claimed as proof of the conspiracy the ""fact"" that the company was owned in part by the Clinton Foundation. For example, WeAreTheNe.ws, a website dedicated to the QAnon conspiracy theory, posted the following image under the caption: ""CLINTON FOUNDATION HAS TIES TO THE DOMINION PROGRAM""::This image is a genuine screenshot from the Clinton Foundation website. However, it does not document that the Clinton Foundation owns a stake in Dominion Voting, or has any control over how the company operates.The statement captured in the screenshot stated that Dominion Voting was offering philanthropic support to the DELIAN Project, a ""Non-Governmental Organization dedicated to helping jurisdictions implement positive change in the democratic voting process through the application of technology."" The Clinton Foundation published a blurb about Dominion's support of the DELIAN project, but that alone does not establish that the Clinton Foundation had any actual involvement in Dominion's operations.:The closest thing to a ""tie"" between the Clinton Foundation and Dominion Voting we could find came from a 2015 Washington Post report about the various organizations that have donated to the Clinton Foundation. That report found that Dominion Voting donated between $25,001 and $50,000 to the Clinton Foundation, but lobbyists working for Dominion also donated to Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.Dominion said in a statement that they are a non-partisan company:DOMINION IS A NONPARTISAN U.S. COMPANY.Dominion has no company ownership relationships with any member of the Pelosi family, the Feinstein family, or the Clinton Global Initiative, Smartmatic, or any ties to Venezuela. Dominion works with all political parties; our customer base and our government outreach practices reflect this nonpartisan approach.Is House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Connected to Dominion Voting? Dominion Voting Systems has hired lobbyists connected to members of both parties.:Social media users also alleged that Dominion Voting Systems was involved in some sort of voter fraud because they had worked with persons connected to high-ranking Democrats, such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi:This tweet does not tell the full story. Dominion Voting Systems worked with a variety of lobbyists who were connected to both Democrats and Republicans.:In the aftermath of the 2016 election, intensified scrutiny was focused on America's voting systems in general and Dominion Voting Systems in particular. The latter is one of the larger providers of election equipment and software, and they hired lobbyists to assist with the company's interactions with the U.S. Congress. Nadeam Elshami, Pelosi's former chief of staff, was one of these lobbyists, as Bloomberg News reported:Dominion Voting Systems -- which commands more than a third of the voting-machine market without having Washington lobbyists -- has hired its first, a high-powered firm that includes a longtime aide to Speaker Nancy Pelosi.Dominion, however, also hired lobbyists connected to the Republican party. The New York Times, for example, reported that Jared Thomas, who once served as chief of staff for the (Republican) governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, also lobbied for Dominion.The Election Integrity Partnership, a coalition of research entities focused on preventing attempts to delegitimize election results, also looked into some of the fraud claims levied against Dominion Voting Systems and labeled them as ""false"":: "

312,312,638.DidGuatemalanAuthori,"Claim:Guatemalan authorities rescued a group of minors from human smugglers in the migrant caravan.Rating:UnprovenAbout this rating On 25 October 2018, the blog for the right-wing legal activist organization Judicial Watch reported that they had ""obtained exclusive information and photos from Guatemalan authorities revealing that they have recovered seven unaccompanied minors from human smugglers working inside the caravan."":However the report, which included a blurred image of several children in what appeared to be a dirty bathroom, contained no specifics by which we could independently verify it. We reached out to Guatemalan police and are awaiting an answer, and we also sent Judicial Watch a list of detailed questions about the source of their information. The latter organization's president, Tom Fitton, didn't answer our questions, claiming their source was ""confidential.""  The caravan in question originated in Honduras on 12 October 2018, when thousands of migrants banded together for safety and began the journey on foot toward the U.S.-Mexico border. Since its inception, the caravan has been the source of a number of hoaxes, conspiracy theories and continuous fear mongering in the lead-up to consequential midterm elections that could tip the political balance of power in the United States.Judicial Watch thus far has been the only source of information on this subject  we've located. The information, they claimed, was given to them by unidentified Guatemalan authorities::Judicial Watch has obtained exclusive information and photos from Guatemalan authorities revealing that they have recovered seven unaccompanied minors from human smugglers working inside the caravan. The children have been taken into custody and they are being provided with food, water and medical attention, according to a high-level Guatemalan government official. The smugglers have been arrested and the broader investigation into criminal activity in the caravan is ongoing.A Judicial Watch team, headed by Director of Investigations Chris Farrell, spent several days on the Guatemala-Honduras border covering the illegal alien caravan, which originated in the northern Honduran city of San Pedro Sula. The team filed a number of exclusive reports and videos and met with Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales and other top government officials.The story was accompanied by an image of what appeared to be children in a dirty, trash-strewn bathroom::Using several search engines, we were unable to locate any other source for that image.Judicial Watch previously published a misleading report that suggested 100 ISIS terrorists were among the caravan travelers by combining two unrelated news items under one alarming headline reading ""100 ISIS Terrorists Caught in Guatemala as Central American Caravan Heads to U.S.""Although it was true the Guatemalan government had arrested and deported 100 people with links to the terrorist organization, this event was unrelated to, and occurred before, the caravan crossed into Guatemala. The organization previously falsely reported that an ISIS attack was imminent on the border.Farrell, the head of the Judicial Watch ""team"" that was responsible for the report, was banned by Fox News for making false allegations on air that billionaire philanthropist George Soros was funding the migrant caravan. Soros, who is Jewish, is the frequent target of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and received, along with several prominent Democrats and CNN, a pipe bomb device in his mailbox in late October 2018.:Robert Bowers was arrested on suspicion of murdering 11 Jewish synagogue members in Pittsburgh just days after the bombs were delivered and has been charged with various hate crimes. Before the shooting, Bowers posted messages on social media referencing conspiracy theories about Jewish people funding the caravan."
313,313,138.WillUNPeacekeepersBe,"Claim:UN Peacekeepers will be sent to quell violence in Chicago.Rating:FalseAbout this rating A Chicago-area official's comment calling on the United Nations to dispatch peacekeepers to help quell gun violence has been distorted to spark paranoia that feeds into a persistent and popular conspiracy theory about an alleged grand scheme to subvert the sovereignty of the United States.On 14 December 2017 the Chicago Tribune quoted Cook County Commissioner Richard Boykin saying he wanted UN Peacekeepers to help put an end to the ""quiet genocide"" of African-Americans in Chicago. Boykin flew to UN headquarters in New York to meet with UN officials about the issue. Per the Tribune he said::The United Nations has a track record of protecting minority populations. There was tribal warfare between the Tutsis and the Hutus in Africa, and they deployed peacekeeping troops there to help save those populations and reduce the bloodshed. We have to do something -- black people in Chicago make up 30 percent of the population but 80 percent of those who are killed by gun violence.The story resulted in a flurry of blog posts on sites like Anti-Media, IlluminatiExposed.net and Anonymous-Feed.com reporting the possibility there could soon be UN boots on the ground in an American city. The United Nations is a key part of a broad, popular and anti-Semitic conspiracy theory known as the ""New World Order."" Subscribers of this conspiracy theory believe that a secretive cabal of super rich and powerful (usually Jewish) men are plotting a global take-over to establish a one-world autocratic government.Conspiracy sites and networks like conspiratorial InfoWars have long promoted the idea that the UN is preparing to invade the United States, first by disarming Americans.:In a 19 December 2017 segment about Chicago, InfoWars host Alex Jones said:Another thing we told you about decades ago that's happening -- I remember when I was a child hearing about the UN plan of Henry Kissinger to create so much crime in LA and Chicago that finally we would accept UN troops on the streets. ... Well guess what folks. Here it is. Here it is with all of them saying, we're gonna have UNESCO come in through the police departments with federal control, and use the federal authority to then order police departments that we've bullied and demonized and attacked to sign on to Strong Cities and go under Southern Poverty Law Center-ADL-UN control, just like the WikiLeaks said they want them in control of the Internet, and those are the same groups in control of Google, Facebook and Twitter censorship now. And they want to cover up what they're doing because they're directing the take-over.InfoWars editor-at-large Paul Joseph Watson warned in a 19 December 2017 story:The idea of deploying UN peacekeepers on U.S. soil is likely to rile many on the right who have warned about international forces conducting gun confiscation operations domestically for decades.:Despite the dire warnings, Watson's own reference to ""decades"" indicates how long these unsupported rumors have been around. University of California, Davis history professor Kathryn Olmstead, who specializes in studying conspiracy theories, told us:Many conspiracy theories focus on threats to the integrity of the nation. In the 19th and 20th centuries, conservative Americans feared Communists, Jews, Catholics and Masons at least in part because those groups allegedly placed allegiance to an international movement or religion above their duty to their nation. Today, American nationalists worry that the United Nations wants to undermine American values or institutions in the pursuit of its internationalist agenda.More specifically, RationalWiki points out that the UN is the mechanism conspiracy theorists believe will be used in subordinating the United States to the global order:The New World Order conspiracy started as an extension of old John Birch Society conspiracy theories about the role of the United Nations. This theory claimed that the United Nations was merely a tool of the Communists, and that the end goal was the complete subjugation of the United States to the United Nations. This would then set up a world government in which all of the freedoms that Americans hold dear would be abolished. Usually, top American officials were claimed to be in on the conspiracy.:Patrick Oldendorf, spokesman for Boykin, said his staff was taken aback by the hostile backlash online to the commissioner's comments.Oldendorf said the commissioner's comments were blown out of proportion. He never intended to have peacekeeper boots on the ground in Chicago. Instead Boykin was simply in search of ideas to stop an upsurge in homicides in the Windy City. Oldendorf told us:The goal was to find successful strategies that they have implemented elsewhere, not guns and tanks but the work that they do that is effective in quelling violence.Even if some of Chicago's local leaders did want UN Peacekeeper boots on the ground, an outsider simply making the request to the UN wouldn't result in an international blue helmet mission there. UN Peacekeeping missions are voted on by the Security Council which consists of five permanent member states (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and 10 countries elected to two-year terms. A UN Peacekeeper spokesman confirmed ""there is no planning of any kind"" to send a mission to Chicago.:Regardless, angry comments proliferated on Boykin's official Facebook page, in which he was accused of inviting UN troops onto U.S. soil for conspiratorial reasons. One man wrote:What a moronic statement. First of all you do not have the power to invite the UN into our country. Secondly, this sounds like a job for the National Guard. Thirdly, the UN can take my guns for my cold dead hands. I dont think that they would get too far in my neighborhood. Too many AR15's on my street.Perhaps in an effort to settle the issue, Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told the Tribune, in response to Boykin's comments, that UN Peacekeepers have no jurisdiction in Chicago."
314,314,363.DoestheMonsterEnergy,"Claim:Monster brand energy drink uses a Hebrew version of 666 in their logo.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 9 November 2014, a long-circulating conspiracy theory about Monster brand energy drinks, the symbol ""666"", and a secret agenda to infiltrate Christian homes with satanic beverages ""crossed over"" when a lengthy video explanation of the concept was published to YouTube, shared on Facebook, and viewed by millions of users::I just watched a video on Facebook of a lady discussing all the satanic symbolism on ""Monster Energy Drink"" cans. The ""M"" is made of 3 Hebrew symbols for the number 6 - so 666.There is a cross in the ""O"" - that is ""witchcraft"" bc when you tip the can it's an upside down cross.It mentions ""MILF's"" like the drink so you will too - hence the can is not christian as the cross suggests at first site.:The clip displayed above featured a very sincere woman who laid out the Monster 666 theory in-depth, and her claims rested on a number of assumptions, including the assumptions that Satan worshippers are numerous, have infiltrated large corporations for unknown reasons, and seek to use their wealth and power to pointlessly infuse benign daily objects with coded signals. Another crucial assumption was most Americans don't know enough about how Hebrew works to understand it doesn't quite translate to what the woman in the video suggests:Look at the 'M' closely, there's a gap right here in the letter, it's never connected. So you go to Hebrew. The letter Vav is also the number six -- you could have here, in Hebrew, 666. But my interest is the word Monster, what do you see in the O? There's a cross. What has Christ got to do with an energy drink?The matter of the cross is ""solved"" by the video's narrator, who believes the symbol she identifies as Christian is turned upside down with each sip of the drink, invoking the common idea that adherents of Satan employ subverted Christian icons. The woman never fully articulates what the end game of secret Satanic symbols on Monster energy drink cans might be, but she concludes: ""You see these Ms everywhere. Hats, t-shirts, bumper stickers. Is there another agenda here? If God can use people and product, so can Satan."":The rumors about 666s and other Satanic hidden symbols on Monster energy drinks have been circulating since at least 2009; however, the video has revived the old and long-debunked rumors with a vengeance.Ultimately, the claim involving a 666 on Monster energy drink cans relies on the incorrect assumption the three claw marks comprising the logo represent three iterations of the Hebrew symbol ""Vav,"" resulting in a Hebrew equivalent of ""666."" But ""666"" in Hebrew would be written ""Tav Resh Samech Vav,"" or ""six hundred sixty-six.""At the end of the clip, the woman points to a ""cross"" in the Monster logo, which is inverted when the can is tipped for drinking. However, the symbol to which the woman refers is phi, a pre-Christian Greek character that has nothing to do with Christianity, witchcraft, or Satanic messaging."
315,315,166.Dida2005MovieFeature,"Claim:The 2005 movie Category 7: The End of the World predicted the arrival of hurricanes named Harvey and Irma.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In September 2017, rumors emerged on social media that a 2005 movie predicted current events by featuring two hurricanes named Harvey and Irma -- and that this somehow proved that the hurricanes were both human-engineered.A typical viral message read as follows::11 years and 9 months ago a movie came out called ""Category 7 End of the World"" and there were only two episodes called ""Harvey"" and ""Irma""! Read that over a few times until it sinks in! These are NOT ""storms"", but predictive program attacks on the American people that they told ""U.S."" about in the Hollywood black magic ritual of telling their victims exactly how you intend to take their lives.The second hurricane called IRMA in the movie struck the United States on 9/11, and guess when this storm is suppose to hit ""U.S.""? This is way too much of a ""coincidence"" for even the casual observer to ignore. Category 7: End of the World was a two-part made-for-TV movie broadcast by CBS in November 2005. It's an apocalyptic thriller directed by Dick Lowry and starring Shannon Doherty about a series of extreme weather events that cause destruction around the world.In the movie, a hurricane named Eduardo strikes Florida and Washington, D.C., while an unnamed Category 6 storm hits New York. Eventually the two combine, causing the movie's eponymous Category 7 storm, which threatens a global catastrophe. :None of the storms or hurricanes in the movie was named Harvey or Irma. Furthermore, Category 7: End of the World was broadcast in November 2005, which was 11 years and 10 months (not nine months) before Hurricane Irma's expected landfall in Florida on 10 September 2017. So the meme's two key claims were false. However, even if these claims were accurate, they would have no sinister meaning. Atlantic hurricanes are named from a prescribed list of names that are rotated every six years and published in advance. So we already know the list of potential hurricane names for 2018, 2019, and every year for the foreseeable future, unless they are changed by the World Meteorological Association. There was a Hurricane Harvey, for example, in 2011 and a Tropical Storm Harvey in 2005 and 1999. Had the filmmakers named their fictional storms Harvey or Irma, they could easily have chosen them from the same publicly available list.:Even if there had been 11 years and 9 months between the original broadcast of Category 7: End of the World, and Hurricane Irma's expected landfall, this would be a meaningless coincidence.To believe otherwise requires believing a vast, unfeasibly complicated conspiracy theory involving the movie's writers, directors, CBS, and the federal government, who would then have to engineer and manage a tropical storm into a powerful hurricane (something that is impossible) and time its development to perfection so that it makes landfall in the United States on 11 September 2017 exactly.In reality, Hurricane Irma is expected to hit the continental U.S. on 10 September 2017. However, again, even if the post had gotten the dates right, the idea that they contain significance is an example of cherry-picking numerical patterns (which exist everywhere) and contorting them to fit pre-existing beliefs and theories. We have addressed such pattern-seeking previously, in the context of both hurricanes and terrorist attacks.:The ""Category 7"" meme consists of a ludicrous conspiracy theory based on evidence-free claims about government ""geoengineering"" and numerology, and ignores the fact that hurricane names are made public years in advance. Furthermore, its two key factual claims - that the hurricanes in the movie were named Harvey and Irma, and that the movie was released 11 years and nine months ago - are false.  "
316,316,473.NoVolodymyrZelenskyy,"Claim:Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wore a Nazi symbol in public appearances in 2022. Rating:FalseAbout this rating March 2022 saw the latest prominent example of a ludicrous conspiracy theory that falsely claims Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is a neo-Nazi, or holds views sympathetic towards Nazism. The smear against Zelenskyy -- who is himself Jewish and whose great-uncles died in the Holocaust -- is designed to justify Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which began in late February. :Previously, Snopes has debunked a similar false rumor about Zelenskyy, concluding that a photograph which appeared to show him holding aloft a soccer jersey emblazoned with a swastika was, in fact, the result of digital editing. In this case, social media users pointed to a symbol visible on Zelenskyy's T-shirt during his daily video messages, claiming it was a Nazi ""Iron Cross,"" and therefore proof of Zelenskyy's Nazism. For example, a March 16 post on the /conspiracy section of the popular forum Reddit contained: screenshots of Zelenskyy wearing a green T-shirt emblazoned with a cruciform symbol; pictures of the Iron Cross; an excerpt from the Wikipedia entry for ""Iron Cross""; and the suggestive caption ""Probably just a coincidence."":Some were more explicit in claiming that Zelenskyy was wearing a Nazi symbol, in a brazen demonstration of his supposed Nazism, while others rather insidiously presented their claim in the form of a question. On Facebook, the claim was shared widely, as shown in the screenshot below:In reality, of course, those claims were false. Zelenskyy did not wear a Nazi symbol, not least because he himself is not a Nazi or neo-Nazi. Rather, the cross on his T-shirt was the official emblem of Ukraine's armed forces. Given that he is, in his capacity as president, also the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of those armed forces, and those forces are currently fighting off an invasion, Zelenskyy's wearing of the symbol could hardly be less surprising, less controversial, or less in need of elaborate explanation. Our rating is ""False."":The emblem of Ukraine's Armed Forces was officially adopted by a presidential decree in September 2009. It consists of the tryzub -- the blue and gold trident of Vladimir the Great, a medieval Ukrainian leader -- placed at the center of a red cross pattee::Zelensky often wears attire emblazoned with a modified version of that emblem, without the original color palette. For example, here it is on his T-shirt in a March 6 video::And in a March 9 video::The cross pattee is a type of cross whose legs are narrower at the center and widen at their ends. It has been a nearly ubiquitous feature of European heraldry and symbolism for nearly 1,000 years, featuring in countless flags, coats of arms, and emblems, in a variety of historical, geographic, and political contexts.For example, the cross pattee is a key component of the Victoria Cross -- the most prestigious royal honor available to members of the British Armed Forces: Victoria Cross, The Victoria Cross Is The Highest Military Decoration Awarded For Valour To Members Of The Armed Forces Of Various Commonwealth Countries, And Previous British Empire Territories. (Photo By Encyclopaedia Britannica/UIG Via Getty Images):Similarly, the cross pattee features prominently: on the flag of the country of Georgia; the U.S. Armed Forces Distinguished Flying Cross; flags used by the Knights Templar; the coat of arms of Durham University in England; and the crest of Toulouse F.C., a French soccer club, among many others.In Russia, the cross pattee forms an important part of the medals awarded to those inducted into the Order of St. George, the highest Russian military honor available. The order, including descriptions of the cross pattee to be used in associated medals and ribbons, was reestablished in August 2000 under a decree signed by President Vladimir Putin. In the late 19th century and during World War I, the cross pattee was a key component of the Iron Cross -- a military medal awarded in the German Empire. In World War II, Adolf Hitler reintroduced the Iron Cross, and it has since taken on an association with Nazism.It's important to note here that even in the rather narrow historical context of German military insignia, the cross pattee is not originally or uniquely Nazi; but because of its use in World War II, the Iron Cross has become one of several Third Reich symbols favored by 21st-century white supremacists and white nationalists in the United States. However, the Anti-Defamation League notes on its website::""...An Iron Cross in isolation (i.e., without a superimposed swastika or without other accompanying hate symbols) cannot be determined to be a hate symbol. Care must therefore be used to correctly interpret this symbol in whatever context in which it may be found.""Some key facts, in conclusion: The emblem of Ukraine's armed forces is not an Iron Cross. Both contain the cross patee, but the Ukrainian emblem has a second component, which is lacking in the Iron Cross -- the trident of Vladimir the Great. Therefore, claims that Zelenskyy was furtively showing off his supposed Nazism by wearing an Iron Cross were: factually inaccurate (it's not actually an Iron Cross); incoherent (by the same logic, Durham University is a bastion of Nazism, and anyone awarded the Victoria Cross is a Nazi of the highest order); and execrable (Zelenskyy is Jewish and has family members who were slaughtered in the Holocaust).

317,317,469.WasaHumanSacrificeCa,"Claim:A leaked video depicts a human sacrifice conducted by researchers at the CERN nuclear research facility.Rating:FalseAbout this rating A video concurrently published to YouTube and the Facebook page ""Stranger Than Fiction News"" on 11 August 2016 (titled ""MURDER AT CERN - DISTURBING HUMAN SACRIFICE VIDEO SURFACES"") purportedly depicting an human sacrifice carried out by researchers at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN).:The video included commentary from a narrator who stated that the facility was secured and open only to individuals with proper security clearances, that the person filming the video obfuscated his or her involvement with the ""sacrifice"" in order to deliberately ""leak"" the footage, and that the grainy violence at the end of the clip appeared to be authentic:The rumor predictably and rapidly made its way to conspiracy peddlers and social media groups devoted to promulgating similar rumors, and the ""evidence"" presented in the video relating to the CERN facility led some social media users to wonder whether there was any chance the clip was real as described. It didn't help that CERN and its Large Hadron Collider (LHC, the largest and most powerful particle collider in the world) are conspiracy magnets of a sort, having previously prompted falsehoods suggesting scientists working at the facility caused earthquakes or inadvertently opened up ""UFO portals,"" Nor did the media's propensity for publishing CERN headlines light on facts but heavy on question marks and doomsday scuttlebutt do much more than amplify perpetually circulating worries about the research facility. :Over the years CERN and the LHC have been the subject of claims the accelerator could ""spawn"" black holes, ""trigger a catastrophic chain reaction in the very fabric of space and time itself which would rip apart the entire universe"" (in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights), just generally ""kill us all,"" dangerously unveil the existence of multiverses, summon the anti-Christ, or open a ""portal to hell."" An article about the ""hell"" claim delves into why CERN is often the subject of terrifying rumors, despite a notable dearth of black holes or hell portals amidst ongoing research:Doomsday theorists frequently blame international labs like CERN for putting the world in danger ... Conspiracy theories flourish when a government organization is involved in an event that the general public can't quite comprehend, like the 1969 lunar landing, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy or scientific discoveries at places like CERN.""Any time there is a situation where there is a lack of information,"" said Dr. Viren Swami, psychologist at Anglia Ruskin University in the United Kingdom, ""people are much more likely to explain that with a conspiracy theory."":The most recent apocalyptic scare demonstrated Swami's theory in action ... Major news outlets did not cover the doomsday theory involving CERN, so a published press release would only worry CERN's 1.25 million Twitter followers and 500,000 Facebook followers.CERN needed to target the places where the theory was most popular while constructing their response. The September [2015 apocalypse] theory ""was huge on social media but it was only on social media,"" said Arnaud Marsollier, CERN's press chief. ""If we had published something it would have been buzz for sure.""Although CERN did not promote its news releases on social media, a quick Google search of ""Sept. 23 CERN"" puts the press release the top of the results. Would-be theorists can analyze the science and purpose of CERN on their own with an easily digestible list of facts, without feeling forced to take a side on whether or not the world will end.Ultimately, Sept. 23 came and went, the world did not end, and scientists continued their work at CERN ... But CERN will probably always have to deal with conspiracy theories, Marsollier said. ""The end of the world is announced every year."":Nonetheless, rumors about CERN similar to the ""human sacrifice"" video likely proliferate in part due to fear and confusion over the purpose of CERN's research and the existence of the LHC. Particle physics isn't a topic that most non-physicists easily grasp, although CERN has attempted to addressed more than a decade of fearmongering about their activities in the Media and Press Relations section of their web site.  Some details ""revealed"" in the human sacrifice video about the latest rumor also aren't secrets at all, and CERN's social media FAQ page takes a crack at alleviating fears surrounding the facility. In one answer, CERN confirmed the presence of a statue of Shiva honoring a relationship with India that dates back half a century:The Shiva statue was a gift from India to celebrate its association with CERN, which started in the 1960's and remains strong today. In the Hindu religion, Lord Shiva practiced Nataraj dance which symbolises Shakti, or life force. This deity was chosen by the Indian government because of a metaphor that was drawn between the cosmic dance of the Nataraj and the modern study of the 'cosmic dance' of subatomic particles. India is one of CERN's observer states, along with the USA, Russia and Japan. CERN is a multicultural organisation that welcomes scientists from more than 100 countries and 680 institutions. The Shiva statue is only one of the many statues and art pieces at CERN.:Another apparent recent addition to the FAQ addresses the video specifically, contradicts claims of absolute facility lockdown, and discourages such pranks:I have seen a video of a strange ritual at CERN, is it real?No, this video is a work of fiction. CERN fills up with visitors over summer, with users from across the world who come to CERN as part of their work, and some of whom occasionally let their sense of humour go too far, and that is what has happened on this occasion. CERN does not condone this kind of spoof.A spokesperson for CERN also told us that the video was a prank that appeared on the internet for the first time in August 2016, and added with respect to rumors and imaginative theories about the facility:The type of fundamental research performed at CERN brings together a large global community of physics from more than 60 countries and 500 institutions (for example, in the United States alone there are 1700 physics from 7 national laboratories and 94 US universities who are part of the Large Hadron Collider research program.)This fundamental research pushes the boundaries of knowledge and is helping us better understand the fundamental principles of physics and the evolution of matter in the universe. Because the research pushes into unknown scientific territory, some theoretical physics think that LHC research might reveal previously unknown properties of nature, such as the existence of microscopic extra dimensions or particles that don't interact with ordinary matter (called ""dark sector"" particles).The research performed at CERN captures the imagination of theorists, scientists, students, artists and creative thinkers, which is why CERN has been featured in books like '[Angels] and Demons' by Dan Brown and in artistic installations around the world. These imaginative and creative works inspired by the scientific research are works of fiction generated to capture the reader/view's sense of wonder and should not be confused with the actual scientific research:CERN's grounds are flooded with international visitors during the summer, many of whom are aware of entrenched conspiracy theories and who opt to make light of the rumors. Of all the circulating CERN or LHC conspiracies, the ""human sacrifice"" video rates perhaps the lowest on a scale of plausibility."

And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. :In October 2020, Snopes readers asked us to look into the authenticity of a quotation widely attributed to the actor and left-wing activist Jane Fonda, in which she purportedly said in an online video clip that the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic was ""God's gift to the Left.""Fox News, for example, reported that:Actress Jane Fonda called coronavirus ""God's gift to the left"" because it allowed Americans to see President Trump isn't helping the working class. The far-left star was busy urging Americans to vote for Democratic nominee Joe Biden and said the upcoming election is a crossroads for the nation.Similar articles were published by The Hill and The Sun. Several right-leaning outlets described Fonda as a ""Biden surrogate,"" including the Washington Free Beacon, the right-wing conspiracy theory website the Gateway Pundit, and the Daily Caller::In the widely shared video footage, Fonda says:We can stop fascism. We are at a point where we can -- this is a crossroads, it's an existential crossroads, and we are people who can help determine which way humanity goes. What a great gift! What a tremendous opportunity, we're just so lucky. We have to use it with every ounce of intelligence and courage and wherewithal we have, because you're absolutely right -- this is it. This is it.And I just think that COVID is God's gift to the Left. [Laughs]. That's a terrible thing to say. I mean I think it was a very difficult thing to send down to us, but it has ripped the Band-aid off who he [Trump] is and what he stands for, and what is being done to average people and working people in this country. We can see it now. People who couldn't see it before, they see it now. And we have a chance to harness that anger and make a difference. So I just, I feel so blessed to be alive right now.:The clip published by various, mostly right-leaning outlets was authentic and not doctored or manipulated in any way.Although the footage was cut from a much longer conversation, that removal from its original context did not distort the sense or meaning of Fonda's remarks, which came towards the end of an Oct. 2, 2020, discussion between Fonda and Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party, a small New York-based left-wing party:https://youtu.be/WuCvO7gNzfY?t=5134 Fonda has been a controversial public figure for several decades and is something of a hate figure for some on the American Right. An outspoken opponent of the Vietnam War, Fonda visited North Vietnam in 1972 for two weeks, spent time with Communist troops there, and was photographed sitting on an anti-aircraft gun, an episode that prompted widespread outrage back in the U.S. and which Fonda later said she would ""regret to my dying day.""Descriptions of her as a ""Biden surrogate"" could damage the Democratic presidential candidate's campaign, by association, in the minds of some readers, but they appear to be factually questionable.:A campaign surrogate is a person, usually already well-known, who represents the candidate at public events and rallies, because the candidate can't appear everywhere at once, or because the surrogate in question might hold a special appeal for a particular intended audience. They can be local politicians; family members (think of Eric, Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr.'s roles in the Trump campaign, or the role that Jill Biden plays in the Biden campaign); and sometimes celebrities (think of the rapper Killer Mike's role in the primary campaign of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, or the actor Eva Longoria's role in both the 2012 reelection campaign of then-President Barack Obama, and the 2016 campaign of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton).Campaign surrogates and their public appearances are typically closely coordinated with campaign staff. Biden's 2020 campaign even has a ""Director of Surrogates,"" the retired Olympic figure skater Michelle Kwan, who is responsible for enlisting surrogates and orchestrating their efforts.We could find no record of Fonda having been described as a Biden campaign surrogate before those characterizations cropped up in October 2020. She took part in a campaign fundraiser in August 2020, along with Lily Tomlin, her co-star on the Netflix show ""Grace and Frankie,"" but that's the only involvement with the Biden campaign that we found. As recently as March 2020, Fonda was endorsing Sanders, not Biden, for the Democratic presidential nomination. :"

Why? Because of an affair she had, claimed the indifferently-punctuated article, with none other than the frontman to the band U2::According to many local observers the ominous news is considered widely as a harbinger of widening rifts within Jordan's tormented social fabrics as the Arab nation of seven million is equally divided into native Jordanians and descendents of Palestinian refugees whom Queen Rania belonged.Unbeknownst to many Westerners, the King Abdullah of Jordan, a close ally of Obama administration, supports and harbors fanatic Saudi-backed ISIS terrorists and seeks to spread terrorism in the Middle-East region.While Queen Rania showed herself as a typical glamorous Queen, showing more agreeable and democratic facade to her husband's despotic and repressive regime, but the rumors in Jordan whisper that there was a secret side to Rania's life, that is least publicized. One thing facts could confirm though, Rania was living a life on the fast lane that is very much Hollywood, and Hollywood indeed, with all that come with that in stark contrast to restricted norms in her country. Dr. Oday al-Shana'a, a London-based former Jordanian court official and ex-friend believes that Bono, the famous Irish singer and so-called philanthropist seduced the innocent Queen.The story quickly spread through social media and aggregation sites, but there's no truth to it. AWD News, the web site on which the story originated, doesn't have more than a nodding acquaintance with facts, instead playing on nationalistic fantasy and conspiracy theory to create alarming (and thus clickable and shareable) stories.:AWD News' story also included the following passage:""I am sorry to inform you that due to yet unexpected reasons, Her Majesty the Queen was found dead at her Excelsior Hotel room, 9:00 pm yesterday night . His Majesty expresses his sincere gratitude to the international  outpouring of grief and sorrow over the Queen 's death,"" Moscow Times cited Mr. Tarawneh on Friday as saying, adding that before her death, the Queen did much to precipitate ending the long-troubled marriage by travelling to Rome to meet a family friend without King's permission.No such quote was published in the Moscow Times, nor could we find it reproduced in any article that is not a copy of the AWD News story.Other extremely dubious headlines that have appeared on the site include the following: ""European Union Unveils the Creation of 'EU Army' Hidden from British Voters Over the 'Danger of Russia,'"" ""Saudi Arabia offers Mark Zuckerberg $250 billion to buy Facebook and arrest the pro-democracy activists, say reports,"" and ""Assassins Who Killed British MP Jo Cox and Targeted Donald Trump Tied to UK Military, CIA."" That last story alleges documents from the Kremlin's Foreign Intelligence Service show that the man who murdered Jo Cox and a man who threatened Donald Trump could be traced back to the same mental hospital. (Needless to say, no such documents exist.):If Queen Rania had indeed been murdered by King Abdullah II in Rome, the news wouldn't be leaked by a conspiracy-oriented web site out of Berlin. Also, if Queen Rania was indeed murdered on or before 24 June 2016, it's news to her, as she's still posting on social media:Happy birthday to Al Hussein!

He has described his own planned social media site as ""the voice of free speech"" and a haven for those who have been ""shamed, marginalized, and characterized for speaking forth truth.""On April 14 and 15, several websites reported, with raised eyebrows, that Lindell had vowed users of Frank would not be allowed to swear or take ""God's name in vain"" -- restrictions that are not present on major social networks such as Twitter and Facebook.Unlilad.co.uk wrote that:If you're after a healthy serving of irony, look no further than Lindell, the rightwing conspiracy theorist who has developed a firm loyalty to former president Donald Trump, and fed into the false claims that Joe Biden stole the 2020 US election.Recently, he spoke about the launch of his new social media platform, Frank, as he shared some more information on his latest venture. Its aim is to unite Conservatives who don't appreciate having to adhere to the terms of use on Twitter or Facebook; instead offering a place where people can speak freely and, well, frankly in an echo chamber to rival the likes of Parler and Gab.The only catch, however, is that Mike doesn't want users sharing certain words and will ban anyone that does. In a recent video, the 59-year-old revealed the specific rules of his free speech safe space: 'You don't get to use the four swear words: the c-word, the n-word, the f-word, or God's name in vain.':The Washington Times and The Verge published articles which similarly highlighted the degree of irony in those restrictions, on a site that Lindell has championed as a bastion of free speech. Those reports were accurate. In a video that appears to have been posted on April 14, Lindell gave a general, and at times rambling, description of Frank, saying users would get a preview of it on April 16, 2021, but it would be formally launched on the morning of April 19, 2021. Lindell said Frank would be ""like a YouTube/Twitter combination, you've never seen anything like it,"" and added:You're going to love it. You're going to have your own, like, YouTube channel, only that's your Twitter handle, or ""Twitter channel"" so to speak... You're not going to have to worry about what you're saying, and what's going -- and worry about being able to speak out freely.And I do want to say one thing. That when you get in there on Thursday [April 16], when you get in there, look at our -- I want you to look at our mission statement. Because we went back and defined -- we found from our founding fathers and the Supreme Court and stuff, what defines free speech. So you're not going to have to worry about people, that they're on there, there's going to be a good reporting system. But you don't get to use the four swear words, you know the C word, the N word, the F word, or God's name in vain. You can't -- free speech is not pornography, free speech isn't ""I'm going to kill you."" It's very well defined in our mission statement. [Emphasis is added].:Major platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, which Lindell and others have criticized as policing speech, do not have an outright ban on the words to which Lindell alluded, but do prohibit hate speech and harassment.Those social networks do not prohibit content that could be interpreted as blasphemous, such as taking ""God's name in vain,"" as Lindell described. However, both Facebook and Twitter have, controversially, cooperated with government officials in cracking down on blasphemy in specific countries where it is outlawed. "

The latest of these was the suicide bomb attack in Manchester, England, on 22 May 2017.:This tweet accurately states that:The terrorist murder of British soldier Lee Rigby took place in London on 22 May 2013.Three bombings at an airport and metro station in Brussels, Belgium, occured on 22 March 2016, killing 32 people.A shooting rampage left nine people dead in Munich, Germany, on 22 July 2016.A car and knife attack near the British Houses of Parliament in Westminster killed four people on 22 March 2017.On 23 May 2017, the Daily Mail joined the chorus, publishing an article whose lengthy headline begins ""Another jihadist attack on the 22nd."" The article, like many tweets and Facebook posts in the days following the Manchester bombing, outlines some significant recent attacks on the 22nd day of various months. The story claimed that ""Security agencies are understood to be examining the possibility that the date - the 22nd of the month - is significant,"" before adding, ""Initial indications suggest there is no link."":The next day, the Men'sXP web site also published an article pointing to a ""dark and scary theory"" about the timing of terrorist attacks:For some reason, the number 22 holds a lot of significance and seems to have a rather sinister link to the events of previous attacks...Others accurately pointed out that the Utoya massacre, in which Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people in a bomb attack and shooting rampage in and near Oslo, Norway, took place on 22 July 2011, and that a suicide bomb attack on a Christian church killed more than 120 people in Peshawar, Pakistan on 22 September 2013. Is there a pattern here? Sure - all these events took place on the 22nd day of a month. But there are patterns everywhere, if you look for them. For example, here's a selective list of prominent transport disasters and crashes that took place on the 23rd day of the month::23 January 1909: The RMS Republic ocean liner collides with the SS Florida, and sinks23 March 1994: A mid-air collision at Pope Air Force Base in Fayettefille, North Carolina kills 23 Air Force members 23 March 1994: Aeroflot Flight 593 crashed into a mountainside on its way from Moscow to Hong Kong, killing all 75 people on board23 August 1944: A US Air Force Liberator bomber aircraft crashed in the village of Freckleton, in the north of England, killing 61 people in total23 August 2000: Gulf Air Flight 072 from Egypt to Bahrain crashed after a failed attempt to land, killing all 143 people on board23 August 2012: A hot-air balloon crash near Ljubljana, Slovenia kills four passengers.This is just a small selection of similar events that have taken place on the same day of different months, in different years. Some even took place on the same day of the same month (the final three in our list), and two took place on the same day of the same month in the same year.:Spooky, right? Not really. All this list illustrates is that patterns can be found almost anywhere, if you go looking for them. Whether a pattern has any greater meaning, or a common factor that is anything more than coincidental, is the real question.Choice vs CoincidencePlane crashes are not like terrorist attacks, however. They are (generally) accidental, and therefore the date on which they occur is not chosen in advance. Are terrorists choosing their attacks for the 22nd day of various months, because it's the 22nd day of the month? Not exactly. We know that some terrorist attacks are timed for specific dates because they mark the anniversary of another attack or significant event.For example, Timothy McVeigh planned the Oklahoma City bombing for 19 April 1995 because it marked the second anniversary of the violent end of the FBI's siege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas - which McVeigh had witnessed firsthand.:And in December 2015, Mohammed Rehman and Sana Ahmed Khan were convicted of planning a thwarted bomb attack in London on 7 July that year, specifically to mark the 10th anniversary of the 7 July 2005 ""7/7"" attacks, which killed 52 people.We don't often get such clear confirmation of ""anniversary"" plots, though.German police suggested Ali David Sonboly's 22 July 2016 shooting rampage in Munich may have been inspired by Anders Behring Breivik's Utoya massacre, exactly five years earlier. The country's Interior Minister said investigators had discovered that the 18-year-old had been researching Breivik's attacks.However, Sonboly killed himself after the attack and so did not face police questioning or a trial, during which the reasoning behind the date might have emerged more definitively.Similarly, Khalid Masood was shot dead by police after killing four people at Westminster in London on 22 March 2017, a year to the day after three terrorist bombings in Brussels. :Julian King, the European Union's Security Commissioner, told a European Parliament committee: ""I don't think it was a complete accident that this attack took place on the first anniversary of the Brussels attacks...""It is also possible that Salman Abedi, the suspected Manchester Arena attacker, timed the bombing to mark the fourth anniversary of the death of British soldier Lee Rigby, who was brutally murdered in an Islamic extremist attack in London on 22 May 2013. But Abedi was killed in the suicide bombing on 22 May 2017, and so far, such a motive for the date of the attack hasn't been established, and may not have been present at all. ConclusionThere are three essential points to bear in mind if you see a meme highlighting terrorist attacks that took place on the 22nd of the month::The whole date matters: When a terrorist attack is planned for a symbolically significant date, it's for a specific day in a specific month. It wasn't the number ""7"" that was important to Mohammed Rehman and Sana Ahmed Khan, in their 2015 bomb plot, it was the full date - 7 July, the 10-year-anniversary of the 2005 London bomb attacks. Likewise, Timothy McVeigh didn't invest huge symbolic weight in the 19th day of every month, just the 19th day of April. It's possible the Manchester Arena attack was timed to mark the anniversary of Lee Rigby's death, but even if it was, it wouldn't have been the number ""22"" that mattered to the bomber, but rather the specific date - 22 May.So focusing on the day of the month - whether it's the 22nd or not - entirely misses the point about ""anniversary"" attacks, which are a real, though far from ubiquitous, part of global terrorism.Terrorists consider a variety of factors when planning an attack: Sometimes terrorists target specific events (for example, the Bastille Day truck attack that killed 86 people in Nice, France on 14 July 2016). Sometimes they target days of the week when public places are likely to be busy (for example, the 8 April 2017 truck attack on a shopping street in Stockholm, Sweden, which took place on a Friday afternoon). Sometimes their attacks are brought forward or pushed back for logistical reasons, or because law enforcement investigators are perceived to be ""closing in"" on them. :Terrorists are no more likely to attack on the 22nd than any other day: We analyzed the dates of 1,327 confirmed or suspected terrorist incidents in Western Europe and North America between 2010 and 2015, drawn from the University of Maryland's Global Terrorism Database and found that the 22nd does not appear statistically more prone to incidents than any other day.In other words, the attacks listed in the May 2017 memes are blatantly cherry-picked from the hundreds of terrorist incidents that have taken place over the past four years.In the six years between 2010 and 2015, 31 incidents took place on the 22nd day of the month, which was actually the lowest number of any day (not that you should attach any particular significance to that). You can check out the data for yourself by downloading this spreadsheet.It's true that terrorists do sometimes choose the date of their attack to commemorate an event that's important to them -- often a previous attack. So as time passes, it could become more likely that certain dates might see an exponential growth in the number of incidents planned or carried out. Of course, police and security agencies around the world are also very aware of these dates, and so the increased prevention and enforcement that comes on dates like 7 July and 11 September may mean such plots are more likely to be thwarted before being executed. :But where a date has significance, it is the full date that matters - not the day of the month. There is no symbolic significance, mystical power, or terrorist conspiracy surrounding the number 22. "
322,322,85.WasAdamSchiffsSister,"Claim:Adam Schiff's sister Melissa was married to George Soros's son, Robert.Rating:FalseAbout this rating As a war of words heated up between President Trump and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) over the release of a controversial memo attempting to discredit the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, a rumor popped up on internet forums that Schiff's sister was married to the son of philanthropist George Soros. :Schiff, the ranking minority member of the House Intelligence Committee, wrote a rebuttal to Devin Nunes's memo alleging that the FBI had improperly obtained a warrant to surveil Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Soon after, users on forums like 4chan, Above Top Secret and Free Republic began posting the rumor that Schiff was related to Soros by marriage. The rumor then spread to junk news sites. The conspiracy-minded TruthFeed reported that ""Twitter is on fire with the revelation that Democratic party mouthpiece Adam Schiff turns out to have 'family ties' to none other than George Soros himself"" and posted a series of tweets about the alleged connection. The article used a series of images of tweets::These rumors also inspired the creation of at least one meme::A disingenuous ""fact check"" from the partisan Tempest Times also lent some unearned credence to this rumor.A woman named Melissa Robin Schiff did indeed marry Robert Soros, the son of George Soros, in 1992. However, she is not Congressman Schiff's sister. The wedding announcement published in the New York Times in 1992 identified Melissa Schiff's parents as Marlene and Haskel, who as of September 2017 were in the midst of a messy divorce.Adam Schiff, on the other hand, was born to Sherry and Ed Schiff. The California congressman also has a brother named Daniel. Schiff does not have a sister, his spokesperson confirmed to us by email. His spokesperson also told us that he has no family relationship at all to Melissa Schiff.To some, the name George Soros invokes the idea of a shadowy Illuminati-like group pulling the strings behind a series of conspiracies. In recent years, he's been falsely accused of paying Black Lives Matter groups to riot, of orchestrating a ""false flag"" in Charlottesville, and of bankrolling women to falsely accuse former Senate Candidate Roy Moore of sexual assault. To these people, merely being associated with Soros is enough to totally destroy a person's credibility. So when Representative Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) was thrust into the political limelight in February 2018, it wasn't too surprising to see the billionaire investor's name get tossed once again into the rumor mill.:This isn't the first time that this smear-by-association tactic has been used. During the 2016 election, for instance, actor Scott Baio popularized an old (and false) rumor that Chelsea Clinton was married to Soros's nephew."
323,323,524.AreSecretNegotiation,"Claim:The World Health Organization is holding a secret meeting that will greatly expand its legal authority.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In mid-January 2023, conspiracy theorists ran with a baffling suggestion: A publicly scheduled meeting of a World Health Organization (WHO) committee -- the terms of which had already been agreed upon in an earlier and equally public meeting -- represented a covert power grab by the organization. :The meeting in question, which took place between Jan. 9 and 13, 2023, concerned amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR) --  a set of already legally binding international laws governing how states respond to public health emergencies. The IHR has been revised and amended several times in the past, most recently in January 2016. The January 2023 meeting was of the International Health Regulations Review Committee (IHRRC). The IHR, according to WHO, provides ""an overarching legal framework that defines countries' rights and obligations in handling public health events and emergencies that have the potential to cross borders"": The IHR are an instrument of international law that is legally-binding on 196 countries, including the 194 WHO Member States. The IHR grew out of the response to deadly epidemics that once overran Europe. They create rights and obligations for countries, including the requirement to report public health events. The Regulations also outline the criteria to determine whether or not a particular event constitutes a ""public health emergency of international concern."":As this meeting was underway, conspiracy-theory oriented media outlets and social media personalities began casting the affair as a secret meeting that -- among other nefarious intentions -- allowed WHO to expand its authority with limited oversight through amendments to the IHR. Discussion of this meeting, which is sometimes accompanied by the hashtag #stoptheamendments, often contains the same copypasta text alleging the meeting is a secret:The International Health Regulations Review Committee (IHRRC) of the World Health Organization (WHO) is planning to meet in secret from Monday, January 9, 2023 to Friday January 13, 2023. The IHRRC will be working to finalize what is now a 46 page document that includes proposed amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR).In addition to that statement, that copypasta text also included a list of 10 proposed amendments described in a way that is -- to put it mildly -- aggressively misleading. Among these claims were: Secret Negotiations for the Amendments to the International Health Regulations change the overall nature of the World Health Organization from an advisory organization that merely makes recommendations to a governing body whose proclamations would be legally-binding. (Article 1)Greatly expand the scope of the International Health Regulations to include scenarios that merely have a ""potential to impact public health.""Seek to remove ""respect for dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of people."" (Article 3) :Here, Snopes demonstrates that this meeting was not secret, and that conspiratorial discussion of these amendments represented, at best, a superficial reading of the proposals designed to instill fear.IHRRC Meeting Is Not 'Secret' The IHRRC meeting in January 2023 had never been secret. It followed, among other events, a May 2022 meeting of all WHO member states that, through compromise, set out a framework and timeline for amending the IHR in light of the most recent pandemic. This meeting and the proposed followup meeting were publicly reported on at the time. As Politico wrote in May 2022:Under the compromise, officially agreed on by countries on Friday evening, countries will have 10 months to reject an amendment to the health regulations instead of nine months, as appeared in an earlier draft text. What has remained in the text is that any amendment to the regulations will come into effect in 12 months. That shaves a year off the current timeline.  A new paragraph added to the text refers to another decision taken at the assembly that will see a working group discuss future IHR amendments. The new text also states that this group will look at amendments to ""address specific and clearly identified issues, challenges, including equity, technological or other developments, or gaps that could not effectively be addressed otherwise.:The IHRRC meeting represented the final meeting of that working group. As the WHO issued news releases about this meeting at its launch, it was never secret. WHO General Secretary Tedros Ghebreyesus issued this public statement at the start of the meeting: This is the 6th and final meeting of the Review Committee on amendments to the IHR, which I convened last October at the request of Member States. ...In total, more than 300 amendments were proposed by Member States, for 33 of the IHR's 66 articles and for five of its nine annexes; in addition, six new articles and one new annex were proposed. The proposed amendments reflect the critical need to strengthen the IHR to improve prevention, preparedness, and response to public health events that carry a risk of international spread.  The Committee has identified several cross-cutting themes, including equity, transparency, trust, sovereignty, collaboration, and assistance, with the overarching goal of protecting public health. These aforementioned amendments were also not secret. Conspiracy theorists have built their entire case about these proposed amendments by looking at a document that literally lays out -- line by line -- each of the proposed changes being discussed. :Amendments Do Not Change The 'Overall Nature' of WHOThe IHR was already legally binding. The totality of the argument that the amendments ""change the overall nature of the World Health Organization from an advisory organization that merely makes recommendations to a governing body whose proclamations would be legally-binding"" rests on the observation that the word ""non-binding"" was removed from two definitions in the proposed amendments:Regardless of the removal of the word non-binding, the WHO was still offering ""advice"" here. Further, this change does not represent a legal shift in WHO power or authority, as the IHR as a whole has always been legally binding. :The Bottom LineThe discussion of the rest of the amendments shared in the copypasta text was similarly superficial, recasting linguistic choices as an attempt to increase legal authority. For example, people sowing fear about the amendments meeting frequently referenced the fact that the amendments removed the words ""respect for dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of people."" While this is true, such discussion omits the words this clause was replaced with: This was not a rejection of human rights, as conspiracy theorists suggested, but a restatement of human rights -- as WHO secretary general indicated -- based on ""cross-cutting themes, including equity, transparency, trust, sovereignty, collaboration, and assistance, with the overarching goal of protecting public health."":More broadly, these amendments did not change the nature of WHO or provide it with enhanced legal authority, as the IHR rules have always been legally binding. As proposed, they do potentially enhance the ability of member states to produce and stockpile vaccine ingredients and authorize -- with deference to local laws -- entry requirements based on things like a negative COVID-19 test. Changes like these are frequently made to the IHR, and their occurrence is far from secret. Every step of this process has been public, reported on, and documented. Because the meeting was not secret and because it did not change the legally binding nature of the IHR, claims that a secret meeting was held by the IHRRC to usurp power for the WHO should be rated ""False.""

324,324,672.UndergroundNuclearEx,"Claim:   A series of underground atomic explosions have taken place at the crippled nuclear plant in Fukushima, Japan. FALSEExample:   [Collected via Facebook, January 2014]An ominous edict issued from the Office of the President of Russia today to all Ministries of the Russian Government ordering that all ""past, present and future"" information relating to Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster now be rated at the highest classification level ""Of Special Importance"" states that this condition is ""immediately and urgently needed"" due to a series of underground nuclear explosions occurring at this crippled atomic plant on 31 December as confirmed by the Ministry of Defense (MoD).""Of Special Importance"" is Russia's highest classification level and refers to information which, if released, would cause damage to the entire Russian Federation.According to this report, MoD ""assests"" associated with the Red Banner Pacific Fleet detected two ""low-level"" underground atomic explosions occurring in the Fukushima disaster zone on 31 December, the first measuring 5.1 magnitude in intensity, followed by a smaller 3.6 magnitude explosion moments later.:   Origins:   This January 2014 article about the President of Russia supposedly issuing an order after the detection of underground atomic explosions at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant (which experienced a series of equipment failures, nuclear meltdowns and releases of radioactive materials after the massive Tohoku earthquake and subsequent tsunami hit Japan in March 2011) isn't a real news item.   It's just more fictional ""Sorcha Faal"" sensationalism originating with a single disreputable source, the whatdoesitmean.com political conspiracy site. RationalWiki notes of whatdoesitmean.com that:Sorcha Faal is the alleged author of an ongoing series of ""reports"" published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don't think much of it. Each report resembles a news story in its style but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don't contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish.:The WhatDoesItMean.com article reflected alarmist reports that were spread on the Internet beginning in December 2013 with headlines such as ""TEPCO Quietly Admits Reactor 3 Could Be Melting Down Now!"" and ""Persons residing on  the west coast of North America should IMMEDIATELY begin preparing for another possible onslaught of dangerous atmospheric radiation!"" Such claims were exaggerations based on much less sensational reports (similar to ones issued several months earlier) which simply stated that the plant's operators, the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), had recently observed steam issuing from one of the damaged Fukushima reactor buildings but had ""not identified [any] abnormal plant conditions.""  As noted at the Fukushima Diary blog:Since the end of 2013, a hoax has been going around on the Internet saying that Reactor #3 is experiencing a meltdown. (In fact, it had already melted down some time earlier.)From my observation, this mess started with an article on Enenews saying that Reactor #3 had been observed still steaming multiple times in December, which is correct. However, ""steam"" has been observed issuing from that reactor beginning in July 2013, and since then it has been observed almost every day. From the frequency of the ""steam,"" I assume it is evaporated coolant water leaking out of primary containment vessel, and we're seeing it now because TEPCO removed the major debris from the top of the reactor. Probably the steam has been coming up since just after [the earthquake of] March 2011.  Sure it's extremely radioactive, nobody can stand on the top of reactor #3, and it's harmful for the west coast. However, it's been that way for 3 years now.:Unfortunately, other political conspiracy sites which have more professional-appearing names and layouts than whatdoesitmean.com, such as the European Union Times, republish the former's fantastic ""Sorcha Faal"" reports, creating the misleading impression that such material is being reported by multiple legitimate news sources.As RationalWiki notes of the European Union Times:The European Union Times strays deeply into tinfoil hat territory. For example, it regularly re-publishes the hilarious ""reports"" of ""Sorcha Faal."" If you see a headline that is really ""out there"" (for example, ""US Earthquake Weapon Test Fails Again, Destroys New Zealand City""), scroll to the bottom and have a look at the ""Source"" link. If it points to whatdoesitmean.com, it's the handiwork of ""Sorcha"".

325,325,154.InPizzaWeTrustHowSom,"Editor's Note: This fact check was reviewed and corrected on June 9, 2023. In August 2020, a photograph showing a T-shirt, reportedly being sold at a Target, bearing the slogan ""In Pizza We Trust"" circulated on social media along with the claim that the department store was endorsing, aiding, encouraging, or was actively participating in pedophilia:  (Reddit):This appears to be a genuine photograph, though we have been unable to confirm this item was available at Target stores. A spokesperson for the chain told us the stores ""don't sell this shirt,"" but it's unclear if it was available in years past (the above-displayed image has been circulating since 2018). Similar items can be found via online retailers. Regardless of the item's availability at Target, neither the shirt nor the chain store has been credibly linked to pedophilia. What Does Pizza Have To Do With Pedophilia?The underlying claim in the above meme and others like it is that pizza is a secret symbol or ""code word"" for pedophilia. The claim that pizza is a code word used by pedophiles first sprung up during the 2016 presidential election, after the email of John Podesta, the chair of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, was hacked by a Russian intelligence agency and published by Wikileaks. As internet users scoured through the illegally obtained material, they noticed some of the emails referred to ""pizza."":This was an innocuous detail to most political observers -- in one email, Podesta suggests using a pizza oven to cook dinner; in another, he suggests buying pizza for political volunteers. But 4chan users posited that the word ""pizza"" in Podesta's emails was actually a code word for pedophilia. The evidence? The first letters in the phrase ""cheese pizza"" -- ""C"" and ""P"" -- are also the first letters of the words ""child pornography."" On 4chan itself, at least, ""CP"" and ""cheese pizza"" had, in fact, been already used for years by Anons (the anonymous users of the vast image and message board) as coded references to child pornography and pedophilia-related content. When they found the word ""pizza"" in Podesta's emails, they built a conspiracy theory around it. (It's unclear when, exactly, the phrase ""cheese pizza"" came into wider use as a code word for child pornography outside of 4chan, but there is concrete evidence that it was used as such at least as far back as 2017, when a Craigslist post containing the phrase played a role in the arrest and conviction of a Lodi, New Jersey, man for receiving child pornography.)In December 2016, The New York Times dissected the evolution of this repeatedly debunked conspiracy theory::WikiLeaks began releasing emails hacked from the account of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, a month before the election.Social media users on a popular Reddit forum dedicated to Donald J. Trump and 4chan's far-right fringe message board searched the releases for evidence of wrongdoing.Within the emails were discussions that include the word pizza, including dinner plans between Mr. Podesta and his lobbyist brother, Tony Podesta.A participant on 4chan connected the phrase ""cheese pizza"" to pedophiles, who on chat boards use the initials ""c.p."" to denote child pornography.Following the use of ""pizza,"" theorists focused on the Washington pizza restaurant Comet Ping Pong. The WikiLeaks emails revealed that John Podesta corresponded with Comet's owner, James Alefantis, who had connections to Democratic operatives.The theory started snowballing, taking on the meme #PizzaGate. Fake news articles emerged and were spread on Twitter and Facebook.The false stories swept up neighboring businesses and bands that had played at Comet. Theories about kill rooms, underground tunnels, satanism and even cannibalism emerged in fabricated stories and on social media.:On Dec. 4, Edgar M. Welch, a 28-year-old from North Carolina, arrived at Comet with a military-style rifle and a handgun. The police said he fired the rifle inside the pizzeria, hurting no one, and surrendered after finding no evidence to support claims of child slaves being held there.The shooting did not put the theory to rest. Purveyors of the theory and fake news pointed to the mainstream media as conspirators of a coverup to protect what they said was a crime ring.It's important to note that while a handful of mentions of pizza occurred in Podesta's emails, the term ""cheese pizza"" did not. This rumor started in large part because 4chan users attempted to read between the lines and invented a connection that does not exist. Journalists have repeatedly debunked ""Pizzagate"" rumors since they started spreading in the lead-up to the 2016 election. One of the most glaring errors and obvious indications that this conspiracy theory was practically conjured out of thin air had to do with the claim that a sex trafficking ring was being run out of the basement of a pizza parlor in Washington, D.C., that had no basement. Alex Jones, the face of the conspiratorial website InfoWars, even apologized for his part in spreading these false rumors. Still, this theory continued to gain traction on social media as it was absorbed into ""QAnon,"" a wide-ranging and unfounded conspiracy theory of dubious origins holding that there's a ""deep state"" plot against U.S. President Donald Trump. :Mother Jones writes:The QAnon conspiracy picked up where Pizzagate left off, alleging that the liberal elite's pedophile ring extends way beyond one restaurant and that it is only a matter of time before Trump arrests Podesta, Clinton, and other Democratic power brokers for their crimes. All of this was fueled by an anonymous internet poster dubbed Q, who claims to be a government insider.In Pizza We Trust While pizza's conspiratorial links to pedophilia are relatively new, the marketing slogan ""In Pizza We Trust"" had whirled around for decades. For example, here's a 1986 coupon from a pizza parlor in California::The arcade and restaurant chain Chuck E. Cheese also used the slogan on game tokens in the 1980s. The slogan has appeared on a wide range of merchandise, such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles T-shirts and designer handbags. Pizza parlors from New York to France to South Africa to Oklahoma have also used this slogan. In other words, the slogan has been used for decades without issue. Of course, ""In Pizza We Trust"" was not the only punny pizza slogan to get caught up in this conspiracy. Similar rumors were also circulated about shirts bearing slogans such as ""Wanna Pizza Me?"" a play on the tough guy phrase, ""Do you want a piece of me?"" as illustrated in the following outtake video from ""Seinfeld"": :Claims that these T-shirts are in anyway related to pedophilia are based solely on the fact that they include the word ""pizza."" But this train of thought quickly derails when you consider the fact that pizza is one of the most popular foods in the world. It is a fact that pizza symbolism and the phrase ""cheese pizza"" are sometimes used as coded references to child pornography and pedophilia, but it's patently absurd to assert, without supporting evidence, that any given reference to pizza connotes those things.The Eye of ProvidenceAccording to these conspiratorial claims, the slogan ""In Pizza We Trust"" isn't the only supposedly suspicious item on the aforementioned T-shirt. The item also includes the Eye of Providence, otherwise known as the ""all-seeing eye,"" which is a symbol that has been used by various groups dating back centuries. In the conspiratorial context, this symbol is often associated with the ""Illuminati,"" a shadowy group of global elites whose globe-controlling puppet strings are much longer in lore than in life. :While the inclusion of this ominous symbol, a slice of pizza, and the slogan ""In Pizza We Trust"" may signal to some that Target is involved in a sex trafficking scheme, a much simpler explanation is at hand. The T-shirt design is spoofing the design on the back of an American dollar bill and making a punny point about how at least pizza is something that everyone can have faith in. Instead of ""In God We Trust,"" the slogan reads ""In Pizza We Trust."" Instead of a pyramid -- which Charles Thomson, who presented the Great Seal to Congress in 1782, said symbolized ""strength and duration"" -- it's a slice of pepperoni pizza. The all-seeing eye appears on the pizza slogan because that's how it appears on the dollar bill::The Motivated Perceptions of Moral PanicsThe United States (as well as the rest of the world) has seen several moral panics over the years. In the 1970s, for instance, parents worried their children's Halloween candy was being spiked with drugs or laced with razor blades. While this fear continues to this day, scant evidence exists that this was ever a genuine problem. While these moral panics typically involve overblown fears and unnecessarily exaggerated reactions, they often run parallel to genuine real-world concerns. The Pizzagate narrative, for instance, took off around the same time that convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire financier with high-profile connections, was arrested on sex trafficking charges. Conspiracy theorists, however, pick and choose which parts of reality they incorporate into their narrative. Yes, a wealthy businessman with high-profile connections was allegedly involved with a sex trafficking ring. No, there's no evidence that ""pizza"" was ever used to orchestrate these crimes. :As fact and fiction blur into one, some people just can't help seeing ""evidence"" wherever they look. The Pizzagate rumors started, in large part, because conspiracy theorists wanted to find something damning in Podesta's emails. When they encountered mundane emails about ordering pizzas for volunteers, they saw salacious invitations for satanic rituals.These illogical leaps continued long after these egregious accusations bore no fruit and, as of this writing, appear to be growing more common. In the summer of 2020, multiple companies have had to issue statements or change business strategies as a growing community of conspiracy theorists turned the faintest hints of suspicion into trending topics. An overpriced cabinet became ""proof"" that Wayfair was trafficking children. A poorly thought out bottom button became ""proof"" that Hasbro was grooming children for pedophilia. And a punny pizza shirt became proof that Target was involved with a sex trafficking scheme.As was the case with the origins of the Pizzagate rumors, no evidence exists to support any of these accusations. :"
326,326,577.TheLadderDowntoHellH,"Islamic scholar and civil rights activist Omar Suleiman was watching in horror as details of the 15 March 2019 mosque massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand, unfolded when he received a text message from a Jewish friend who is a rabbi and Suleiman's counterpart in the interfaith activist community. ""I'm saddened and horrified by the murders in New Zealand. I'm here for you and our Muslim neighbors,"" she wrote.Scrolling up his phone, Suleiman noticed something chilling: such scant time had passed since a white supremacist gunned down 11 worshipers in a Pittsburgh synagogue that ""literally she was sending me the same messages I was sending her"" after the synagogue shooting, Suleiman observed.Occurring a world apart, hate-driven mass murders in houses of worship punctuated the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019. Robert Bowers, charged with gunning down 11 worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in October 2018, is a 46-year-old American, while Brenton Tarrant, charged with killing 50 people in the mid-March 2019 rampage in Christchurch, is a 28-year-old Australian national. What links them is that both spent large amounts of time on social media platforms spewing and marinating in hate.:Both men subscribed to prominent white supremacist conspiracy theories contending that a plot was afoot to phase out white people. Bowers believed Jewish people were orchestrating Central American caravans in a scheme to increase non-white immigration to the U.S. in order to ""replace"" whites, while Tarrant believed that non-white immigrants and shifting demographics in predominantly white countries such as New Zealand were evidence of a ""white genocide.""The killings also coincided with a surge of anti-Muslim hate crimes in other regions of the world, including the United Kingdom and Canada, while in the U.S., such crimes have spiked to all-time highs. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Warwick in England have found a strong statistical correlation between tweets posted by U.S. President Donald Trump on Islam-related topics and anti-Muslim hate crimes.The New Zealand massacre drew attention to what Suleiman sees as related problems: the proliferation of anti-Muslim hate speech on the internet, the mainstreaming of such rhetoric, and the willingness of some who consume such material to take that online activity into the real world with acts of violence and intimidation.:Referring to an echo chamber of social media personalities and websites that traffic in anti-Muslim conspiracy theories, Suleiman said, ""The Islamophobia industry takes one lie and spins that out to create 100 articles and links, so even if you clarify the one lie, 100 articles pollute Google searches."" The goal, he averred, was to create so much online content that those who try to set the record straight can't keep up.He pointed to websites dedicated to propagating a conspiracy theory that Muslims in the U.S. (who account for just over 1 percent of the population) are devising a plot to take over the country, and sites that fabricate narratives of Muslims as barbaric or violent.Islamophobes have ""created so much suspicion about the Muslim community that the natural reaction from their readers is to look at us as the worst of the worst,"" he said. ""Even those that should be our allies keep a distance from us because of all the information that's on the internet. We're embraced in these broad coalitions of diversity, but at the end of the day, people don't want to touch us because of the fear that's been generated about us."":As a result of such activity, Suleiman noted, ""The mosque attack was not surprising. The only thing that's surprising is that it happened in New Zealand.""The Spread of Hate OnlineIn a response to our query about these concerns, a representative from Google told us that the technology giant has been working to remove hate content from their products, to promote high-quality, authoritative sources in search results, and to prohibit and remove hate speech and other material intended to incite violence. Google has also removed search autocomplete predictions that are hateful towards groups or individuals. A spokesperson for YouTube, which is owned by Google, also told us that the platform was taking a tougher stance on videos flagged by users which are not technically in violation of the platform's policies but nonetheless include controversial religious or white supremacist content.Just two days after the New Zealand massacre, Breitbart published a selectively framed story reporting that ""Nigerian Muslim militants"" had killed 120 Christians within a space of three weeks since late February 2019. As Snopes.com reported, the Breitbart story failed to disclose that other forces were at play in the long-running conflict -- namely competition for land and resources -- and that the largest atrocity recorded during February and March 2019 was the killing of 130 members of a mainly Muslim ethnic group by a mainly Christian group. Nonetheless, many social media users shared the Breitbart article asserting that the news media were ignoring the killings of Christians in favor of sympathetically covering the massacre of Muslims in New Zealand::I wonder why the MMSM decided to ignore this story? https://t.co/EIlnONj28c-- toddstarnes (@toddstarnes) March 17, 2019@MSNBC @CNN I'm tired of you blaming our President for wgst hsppebed in New Zealand!! Where's your coverage on this?: https://t.co/tcAIr6aTBo-- DebbieSar (@SarDebbie) March 16, 2019""Memes about how many people have been killed by Muslims are definitely going around"" on social media in the aftermath of New Zealand, said Elon University computer science Professor Megan Squire. ""It's whataboutism. It's just classic, 'Hey, look over there' misdirection.""The idea that the mainstream news media ignore crimes committed by Muslims is not supported by evidence. Research shows that crimes committed by Muslims receive vastly more media attention than similar acts committed by non-Muslims.:For instance, an April 2018 analysis of Washington Post and New York Times articles conducted by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU) found that Muslims arrested on suspicion of plotting violent acts received 770 percent more news coverage than similar plots carried out by non-Muslims in the U.S., while violent acts by Muslim perpetrators received twice the media coverage than attacks carried out by non-Muslims. A January 2019 report published by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) found that every fatal act of violence resulting from extremism in the U.S. in 2018 was linked to far-right ideologies.""As a result, you have this situation where people are hyper-concerned about one type of crime that is in reality far less frequent because the media is so much more focused on it, while ignoring what is actually a greater threat,"" said Dalia Mogahed, research director for ISPU, a think tank that researches public opinion and policies that impact Muslims.In addition, Mogahed pointed to ISPU research that shows ""on average, prosecutors [in the U.S.] sought three times the sentence length for Muslim perpetrators as for perpetrators not identified as Muslim for similar plots of attempted ideologically driven violence."" Additionally, ""Muslim perpetrators received four times the average sentence as their non-Muslim counterparts for attempted plots of similar conduct."" So Muslim perpetrators are not only garnering far more media attention but also heavier penalties Mogahed said.:And when a Muslim commits violence, the entire Muslim community is expected to account for it even though Muslims are statistically the most likely to be victimized by global terror, stated Toronto-based journalist and writer Sarah Hagi.""A big part of this is that we're not included in these narratives that are created about us,"" she said.Only a minority of Americans believe false narratives about the Muslim community, according to ISPU research. But prejudice continues to be a significant problem amplified online: Squire's research of extremist ideologies on Facebook found that anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiments, which often overlap, serve as an ideological center for hate groups.In a 26 September 2018 research paper published at Elon University, Squire concluded in an analysis of Facebook groups based on right-wing extremist ideologies that ""groups with nativist bias, in particular anti-Muslim groups, are front and center in far-right politics. Our analysis also shows that anti-Muslim groups attract the same audiences as other extremist ideologies, including secessionist neo-Confederates, militant anti-government conspiracy theorists, and racist white nationalists. We show that some of the anti-Muslim groups even serve as a convenient lingua franca; their brand of hate is a common denominator that ties people of disparate ideologies together."":""Anti-Muslim groups weren't the first ones on my radar,"" she told us. ""What I started to notice was that every single [far-right] group, no matter what the ideology, were all hating on Muslims.""And she noticed that when she started building up a sample collection of anti-Muslim Facebook groups, ""the language and images they used were way off-the-charts worse than the other groups on Facebook.""To make matters worse, once users start looking at one such group, they'll get suggestions for other similar ones.""That's the ladder down to hell,"" Squire said. ""You start browsing one group and you're in that niche, fetish kind of place where you've been transported magically to the place you never knew existed. Now you can find other people that are also into that. It's all the wonder and promise of the internet, but to this disastrous effect."":A spokesperson for Facebook told us the platform has been working with civil rights organizations to adjust its policy so that Facebook will now remove events in which people are encouraged to bring weapons to intimidate or harass others. Facebook also reported that they removed 2.9 million hate-speech posts in the third quarter of 2018.""Hate speech goes against our Community Standards and is not allowed on Facebook,"" the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. (Facebook generally comments through unnamed members of their public relations staff.) ""We take action on content and accounts that break our Community Standards as soon as we're made aware of it. We continue to invest in our safety and security teams and the technical tools we use to proactively detect hate speech. We also actively work with a range of groups on ways to improve online safety.""Nevertheless, Facebook was caught up in the New Zealand massacre after the shooter used the platform's technology to stream video of the attack in real time using Facebook Live. Only 200 people watched the massacre live, and Facebook moderators took the video down 29 minutes after it began. But with the aid of extremists on the message board 8chan, the mass killer's propaganda was spread and viewed millions of times. In response to that phenomenon, Facebook declared in a blog post about the issue that::Immediately after the attack, we designated this as a terror attack, meaning that any praise, support, or representation violates our Community Standards and is not permitted on Facebook. Given the severe nature of the video, we prohibited its distribution even if shared to raise awareness, or only a segment shared as part of a news report.In the first 24 hours, we removed more than 1.2 million videos of the attack at upload, which were therefore prevented from being seen on our services. Approximately 300,000 additional copies were removed after they were posted.We've been asked why our image and video matching technology, which has been so effective at preventing the spread of propaganda from terrorist organizations, did not catch those additional copies. What challenged our approach was the proliferation of many different variants of the video, driven by the broad and diverse ways in which people shared it[.]A Mountain of Bigotry""I don't think any of these platforms take it seriously enough. I don't know what's in it for them, but it shouldn't have gotten to the point where something like this [New Zealand] was possible,"" Hagi told us.:Oftentimes, smaller acts that don't necessarily capture headlines together create a mountain of bigotry that Muslims face on a daily basis. Suleiman told us his home postal address had been posted online by anti-Muslim internet users, while his 9-year-old daughter had taken to looking over her shoulder during religious observances after being terrified by the sight of armed protesters at the family mosque.""My daughter first saw the protesters when she was six. It really traumatized her,"" Suleiman reported. When the family traveled to Pittsburgh to offer support to the grieving Jewish community there after the Tree of Life massacre, Suleiman said his daughter connected that atrocity to the armed protesters at their mosque in Texas.""Her first question was, 'Was it the same people?' Her second was, 'Did Donald Trump send them?' That's the point where I thought these kids are being forced to wonder about safety and see things no child should have to see."""

Earlier in 2020, Browning lost the Republican primary race for U.S. House Pennsylvania District 7. He described himself in his Twitter bio as: ""A proud pro-life & pro-2A Christian conservative dedicated to enacting common sense solutions to Keep America Great."":On Nov. 10, 2020, someone -- presumably Browning -- controlling his verified Twitter account tweeted: ""I'm a black gay guy and I can personally say that Obama did nothing for me, my life only changed a little bit and it was for the worse. Everything is so much better under Trump though. I feel respected - which I never do when democrats are involved.""The tweet came in response to another Twitter user who responded to one of Browning's pinned tweets. Twitter users speculated that the ""black gay guy"" tweet was apparently to be meant to be issued from an alternate account controlled by Browning under the pretense of being a gay black man who supports U.S. President Donald Trump.:Around five hours after the tweet was posted, a user noticed it, and it began to spread virally, picking up thousands of retweets and likes. Browning then deleted the tweet. Soon after deleting it, he tweeted that he was quoting a message he received earlier from another follower.:The story of the ""black gay guy"" tweet did not end there, however.An account named @DanPurdy322 is believed by Twitter users to be an alternate account maintained by Browning, meaning the ""black gay guy"" tweet may have been meant to be posted under the @DanPurdy322 persona. After Browning deleted that tweet, @DanPurdy322 tweeted two videos, with @DanPurdy322 claiming to have sent Browning the message that Browning tweeted.:We found other instances of @DanPurdy322 responding to someone who replied to Browning.Some Twitter users were quick to note that @DanPurdy322 bore a strong resemblance to William Holte, purported to be singer Patti LaBelle's son. Holte's Facebook account, named facebook.com/william.m.holte in the URL, but Byl Holte by name, contained the same cartoonish profile image from Twitter. @DanPurdy322 also tweeted that ""common sense is the solution,"" which bore a striking similarity to the name of a website listed in Browning's Twitter bio: Common Sense Solutions.In the past, Browning has tweeted about the ""weapon of war"" capabilities of Twitter::Browning's past tweets also included the idea of a ""muzzled"" U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, which included a monkey emoji. Browning also tweeted that Omar's face needed to be ""put on a wanted poster"" to hang in post offices.:He also tweeted that Joe Biden turned his son Hunter into a ""crackhead,"" questioned the COVID-19 death toll, said that ""so many other crimes are more deserving of the national eye than Breonna Taylor,"" spread mail-in voting conspiracy theories ahead of the 2020 U.S. presidential election, and called MSNBC host Joy Reid ""stupid,"" ""racist,"" and a ""cow.""Other tweets from Browning's verified Twitter account included the following, one of which appeared to push the QAnon conspiracy theory:::::In August, the Republican-led U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee issued its fifth and final report on Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, detailing the extent to which Trump campaign officials had involvement in the matter. The report detailed fake American personas that were used by Russia to influence real Americans on social media. Of that, Browning tweeted: The story of the ""black gay guy"" tweet appeared to boil down to one mistake.

328,328,633.WhatisOperationGotha,"In April 2017, a disaster preparedness drill called ""Operation Gotham Shield"" became a topic of interest on conspiracy sites and web forums, prompting speculation that the intriguingly named event was either a planned ""false flag"" attack or a hastily assembled cover for an anticipated nuclear strike on the United States by North Korea.Piqued conspiracy buffs flocked to web sites and social media pages for small regional healthcare agencies and disaster preparedness organizations in order to voice their concerns. Readers seemed to have little understanding of what the exercise might encompass, but were still reasonably certain people should either be vigilant, or else leave town:""Operation Gotham Shield"" Simulating 10kt Nuke Detonation over NYC/NJ Next Mon & Tues https://t.co/hpPCqynJ4y-- The Event Chronicle (@TheEvent2014) April 20, 2017:One popular version of the theory flagged the operation as a false flag or ongoing coverup, and insinuated that the ""drill"" would lead to genuine disaster:A Joint Operation, code named Gotham Shield is scheduled for Apr. 24 & 25. [2017] The premise of this simulated crisis will be the detonation of a 10,000-ton nuclear device in the air over New Jersey.The electromagnetic pulse (EMP) caused by the detonation of this device will cause the disabling of most telephone, internet, and other electronic devices in a 20 kilometer radius around the detonation site ... The problem with this ""exercise"" is that, many times in the past, federal ""exercises"" have become actual events!:On 27 March 2017, the Eastern Region Helicopter Council (ERHC) notified members and volunteers:On Tuesday April 25th 2017, at 0800 the Gotham Shield Exercise will take place at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford NJ. This exercise will simulate a large scale terrorist attack on the NY/NJ metropolitan area with MetLife Stadium serving as a triage/collection point for victims and emergency response personnel. This will be a large scale event with numerous federal, state, county and local agencies participating. It should be very similar in size and scope to the Operation Red Zone drill of 2011.Planning for the event actually began several months prior to the spike in conspiracy theories. As another widely circulated document (PDF) demonstrated, Operation Gotham Shield began long before the early March 2017 reports of nuclear missile testing in North Korea, meaning that rumors that the event was planned to provide cover for concerns over Pyongyang did not wash. Operation Gotham Shield is a legitimate and routine multi-agency and organization disaster drill scheduled in New York and New Jersey in late April 2017. The scheduled drills are standard, common tests of disaster response across agencies, events that almost invariably lead to widespread internet rumors and fears.:In 2015, Jade Helm conspiracy theories (and fake news) were massively popular on social media; the exercise ended, but not before military representatives were forced to visit towns in Texas in an attempt to quell the local uproar. Another rumor a year later held that the Cascadia Rising 2016 disaster preparedness training exercise planned in the Pacific Northwest was deliberately scheduled to disrupt the California primary, but the planned activity took place outside the state and did not threaten voting access in any form."

The video circulated widely without any indication as to when it was filmed and with the words ""Heads up Oklahoma"" edited in, leading some to think it pertained to the ongoing COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic, specifically in the state of Oklahoma.The video, which has been on YouTube since 2009, featured Greg Evensen, a blogger who described himself as a former Kansas State Trooper. In the video, Evensen discussed a government ""edict of mandated vaccinations"":https://youtu.be/vdjz8nroMUU Evensen said in the video that he had been ""told by state troopers across the country that there are plans ready to be implemented that include roadblocks and chokepoints,"" and that there was a plan to fit members of the public with microchips containing ""all kinds of information,"" including whether they had been vaccinated. Anyone who refused to be vaccinated, Evensen said, would be placed in buses and shipped off to detention.:Evensen's comments appeared to be a variation on a cross between two long-standing conspiracy theories. One theory centers on the mass detention of Americans -- in most iterations the detention is to take place in camps created by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). And the other theory centers on activists who believe vaccines are harmful, and that a nefarious conspiracy exists to force them on the public. His remarks were made during the H1N1 swine flu pandemic of 2009.This isn't the first time a large-scale emergency prompted a variation of the claim that FEMA would be forcing people to receive vaccines. During Hurricane Harvey in 2017, a false claim circulated that the agency was denying those impacted by the storm any aid unless they had been vaccinated.Because the video was made in 2009 and had nothing to do with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (for which there was no vaccine, anyway, as of this writing), and because the statements made in the video alluded to unfounded conspiracies that have not come to pass, we rate this claim ""False."":"
330,330,557.IsThereaHammerandSco,"Claim:A supercomputer called ""Hammer"" and a software program called ""Scorecard"" are being used to alter vote counts in the U.S. presidential election of 2020. Rating:FalseAbout this rating Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.In the days after news outlets called the 2020 U.S. presidential election and projected that Joe Biden would be the 46th president of the United States, the internet was flooded with various unfounded claims about voter fraud. One popular rumor concerned something called ""Hammer and Scorecard."" While this rumor was wide ranging, it basically held that a ""deep state"" supercomputer named ""Hammer"" and a computer program called ""Scorecard"" were being used to alter vote counts. :We'll take a closer look at this rumor in the article below. But before we do, we should note that Christopher Krebs, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security -- a position he was nominated to in 2018 by U.S. President Donald Trump -- has called the ""Hammer and Scorecard"" rumors ""nonsense"":'Hammer and Scorecard' Origins:Rumors about the existence of a CIA supercomputer called HAMR (or commonly, ""Hammer"") can be traced to a man named Dennis Montgomery. According to the website American Report, Montgomery, whom the website describes as a ""CIA contractor-turned-whistleblower,"" designed and built this supercomputer. An article published on American Report in October 2020 claimed that U.S. President Barack Obama commandeered this supercomputer shortly after taking office in 2009, used the ""Scorecard"" program to steal the election in 2012, and that this program was being deployed again to steal the election for Biden in 2020. There are many reasons to take these claims with a hefty dose of salt. For example, the article does not explain, among one of its many plot holes, why this program was not used in 2016 to steal the election for Hillary Clinton, or why President Donald Trump, who has held office for the last four years, did not do more to secure our elections from Hammer and Scorecard in 2020. The fact-checking website Lead Stories also notes that some of the specifics in the American Report article don't hold up to scrutiny. For example, American Report claims that Scorecard works by tampering with ""transfer points"" between state computers and third-party election data vaults. The article claims that ""VR Systems Inc"" is one of these transfer points, but VR Systems' COO told Lead Stories that ""VR Systems does not do voter tabulation and is not connected to county or state voter tabulation systems."":But perhaps the biggest red flag is this story's source, Montgomery. The Daily Beast wrote:What Trump allies tend to leave out, however, is that Montgomery has a long history of making outlandish claims that fail to come true. As an intelligence contractor at the height of the War on Terror, Montgomery was behind what's been called ""one of the most elaborate and dangerous hoaxes in American history,"" churning out allegedly fictitious data that once prompted the Bush administration to consider shooting down airplanes.And now, Trump allies want voters to believe Montgomery's claims about the election.In 2006, Montgomery claimed that he had emails showing that Nevada Gov. Jim Gibbons was guilty of bribery. According to USA Today, the Justice Department cleared Gibbons of wrongdoing after a computer expert cast doubt on the authenticity of the emails that had been provided by Montgomery. :Gibbons, who was elected governor in 2006 after five terms in Congress, had steadfastly denied any wrongdoing despite claims by Dennis Montgomery that eTreppid Technologies LLC founder Warren Trepp lavished Gibbons with money and a Caribbean cruise in exchange for help winning contracts for his company.Montgomery's credibility was put in doubt after a computer expert questioned the authenticity of e-mails Montgomery claimed proved Gibbons was accepting gifts.Montgomery was also accused of deceptive practices in 2014 when he claimed to have evidence of a conspiracy against Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio. U.S. District Court Judge G. Murray Snow found that Montgomery's evidence amounted to ""junk,"" and Arpaio agreed.The New York Times wrote:When Judge Snow suggested that the materials provided by Mr. Montgomery were ""junk,"" Deputy Sheridan and Sheriff Arpaio agreed....[Montgomery's] reputation, easily uncovered with a cursory search, includes ample allegations of deception. Federal officials came to believe that he had sold antiterrorism technology that proved to be a hoax. He has denied wrongdoing in a lawsuit.In 2007, he falsely accused the governor of Nevada at the time, Jim Gibbons, of having received kickbacks from Mr. Montgomery's former employer to help it secure secret federal defense contracts. Two years later, Mr. Montgomery was arrested on charges that he had written $1 million in bad checks at a Las Vegas casino. A court hearing is scheduled for Aug. 12. He filed for personal bankruptcy that year, over mounting gambling debts.""This guy hired a person previously found to be a con man,"" said Dan Pochoda, senior counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, which represents the plaintiffs in the case against Sheriff Arpaio.:Here's a PBS report about some of Montgomery's fraudulent claims:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWPTbqm5Hzs&feature=emb_logoDespite Montgomery's history of deception, his claims about Hammer and Scorecard transitioned from the fringes to the mainstream when Fox News' Lou Dobbs interviewed Sidney Powell, the attorney for former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn, on Fox Business. Powell said:""I think there are any number of things they need to investigate, including the likelihood that 3 percent of the vote total was changed in the pre-election voting ballots that were collected digitally by using the Hammer program and the software program called Scorecard. That would have amounted to a massive change in the vote."":Hammer and Scorecard in Action?The Director of CISA has dismissed the claims about Hammer and Scorecard altering vote counts, and these rumors originate with a man who has a long history of making deceptive claims. Still, social media users quickly found ""evidence"" that Hammer and Scorecard was real, and that it was truly being used to steal the 2020 election. In November 2020, a video started to circulate on social media that supposedly showed ""SCORECARD working in real time."" The Conservative Daily Post wrote:In this video, it's easy to see SCORECARD working in real time.:Hammer and ScoreCard switched 19,958 votes live on TV from Trump to Biden in the Pennsylvania Presidential Race!At the 00:04 mark, the video shows Trump 1,690,589 and Biden 1,252,537 ... then the video cycles through the other 'crucial' states of Wisconsin, Arizona and Michigan.It returns to Pennsylvania at the 00:40 mark, and pay close attention here.Trump somehow LOST votes, giving his total at 1,670,631, which is a loss of 19,958 votes! At the same time, Biden picks up that EXACT amount, mysteriously gaining to 1,272,495.The above-displayed video does show a genuine clip from CNN. However, it is not evidence of wrongdoing. In fact, what this video shows isn't even very unusual. CNN, like most news networks, uses data from the National Election Pool to provide real-time election results during their coverage. NBC News wrote::The NEP is a consortium of major news networks -- ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC -- that pools together resources to gather vote and exit poll data. The NEP works with the consumer research firm Edison Research to collect timely and comprehensive election data on Election Day and in the following days, weeks and months until results are certified by all states. The NEP licenses data to several news outlets, including Reuters and The New York Times, among others.The above-displayed video shows a momentary error in these real-time results. A source from CNN told us that this video showed a brief moment when the results were incorrectly transposed from the NEP and that this human error was caught, flagged, and quickly fixed (as shown in the video). This video is not evidence of a supercomputer hacking into the U.S. election system and altering vote counts. It's a video showing a momentary error that was quickly fixed thanks to the numerous safeguards in place to protect the integrity of elections. CISA Director Kreb's message about the Hammer and Scorecard rumors bears repeating: ""Robust safeguards including canvassing and auditing procedures help ensure the accuracy of official election results,"" and that it is not true that a ""bad actor could change election results without detection."" :CISA writes:Reality: Robust safeguards including canvassing and auditing procedures help ensure the accuracy of official election results.Rumor: A bad actor could change election results without detection.Get the Facts: The systems and processes used by election officials to tabulate votes and certify official results are protected by various safeguards that help ensure the accuracy of election results. These safeguards include measures that help ensure tabulation systems function as intended, protect against malicious software, and enable the identification and correction of any irregularities.Every state has voting system safeguards to ensure each ballot cast in the election can be correctly counted. State procedures often include testing and certification of voting systems, required auditable logs, and software checks, such as logic and accuracy tests, to ensure that ballots are properly counted before election results are made official. With these security measures, election officials can check to determine that devices are running the certified software and functioning properly.:Every state also has laws and processes to verify vote tallies before results are officially certified. State processes include robust chain-of-custody procedures, auditable logs, and canvass processes. The vast majority of votes cast in this election will be cast on paper ballots or using machines that produce a paper audit trail, which allow for tabulation audits to be conducted from the paper record in the event any issues emerge with the voting system software, audit logs, or tabulation. These canvass and certification procedures are also generally conducted in the public eye, as political party representatives and other observers are typically allowed to be present, to add an additional layer of verification."

The earliest instance of this item we could find was published on 9 January 2016 by a web site that pushes anti-vaccine propaganda and conspiracy theories (sample headline: ""7 Reasons Why 'Conspiracy Theorists' May Actually Be 'Indigo People'""), and since then it has been shared widely by other dubious, anti-science web sites such as Natural News.:The rest of the story indicates the piece is little more than pro-Russian propaganda intended to appeal to Americans who subscribe to anti-scientific views about vaccines and foods and claims Russia is a major backer of organic farming:Russia under President Putin has been giving away land for free in the past few years to people willing to farm organically and sustainably. The goal is to become the world's ""leading exporter"" of non-GMO foods that are based on ""ecologically clean"" production.Russia did give away land in its sparsely-populated far eastern region that borders China, but not specifically for organic farming. The giveaway was instead an effort to spur development in the region, according to the Global Post:President Vladimir Putin signed a law this month granting 2.5 acres of land to any Russian citizen who wants it.

332,332,480.DoesKavanaughAccuser,"Claim:Kavanaugh accuser Deborah Ramirez has ""ties"" to billionaire philanthropist George Soros.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Amid fraught controversy over the looming Senate Judiciary Committee vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, a false story reporting that a woman accusing him of sexual misconduct had ""ties"" to right wing conspiracy theory boogeyman George Soros spread online.:Two women, Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez, came forward in September 2018 with accusations against Kavanaugh stemming from the 1980s. Ford said Kavanaugh pinned her down, covered her mouth, and attempted to rape her when the two were in high school. Ramirez said he exposed himself to her at a party when the two were undergraduate students at Yale, accusations that threw an already-heated confirmation process into chaos. President Donald Trump's supporters, eager to get Kavanaugh confirmed before November midterm elections, have lobbed a deluge of criticism and scrutiny at the two women, with Trump himself lambasting them and calling the accusations a ""con job"" led by his political opponents.On 23 September 2018, Ramirez's detailed account was published by the New Yorker, in which she maintained that during a 1983-84 school year party, Kavanaugh drunkenly shoved his genitalia toward her face, causing her to inadvertently touch them when she pushed him away. One day after the New Yorker piece was published, claims began circulating online that Ramirez had ties to George Soros because a different woman bearing the same name had won a 2004 fellowship from Soros's Open Society Foundation::The 53-year-old Deborah Ramirez was described in the New Yorker piece as having ""studied sociology and psychology"" and having ""spent years working for an organization that supports victims of domestic violence.""  The other Deborah Ramirez is a law professor at Northeastern University and has nothing to do with the Kavanaugh scandal. She declined to comment for this story.:It's unclear how stories conflating the two women's identities initially made their way onto the Internet. Some news stories pointed to a now-deleted tweet authored by National Review columnist John Fund a day after the New Yorker story was published which read, ""Irony of this is just too great. New Yorker article on new Kavanaugh accuser, Deborah Ramirez, leaves out tie to George Soros. Ramirez got 2003 Soros Justice Fellowship to strengthen understanding between law enforcement and Arab Muslim and Sikh communities.""But in the tweet, Fund said he got the information from another columnist, Quin Hillyer, and from Hillyer we learned the information was passed on to him by yet another journalist whom he declined to name. Hillyer told us Fund's tweet was the result of a misunderstanding:I forwarded a note to Fund, while on the run, on a balky cell phone that kept trying to auto-correct words I was typing. It got garbled. I was alerting him to a potential story, but he misunderstood, because of the garbled words, and assumed I was forwarding a confirmed story, and he Tweeted out the info in a lighthearted matter. As soon as I found out, I apologized for causing the initial confusion -- for something I never printed. John apologized too. Sometimes Twitter works too fast, when even ordinarily careful journalists aren't being as careful when quickly Tweeting as they do when they are publishing actual articles/columns.:Hillyer said he initially thought the information, if true, could be of interest because it might show a potential ideological bias against President Trump and his appointees ""which can influence hazy memories even of somebody honestly trying to recall names and faces after 36 years."" But he pointed out that both he and Fund corrected the record and apologized on social media when they were made aware of the mistake.A number of junk sites took the information and ran with it however. For example the conspiracy-mongering BigLeaguePolitics.com posted, then deleted, a story with the headline, ""BUSTED: Kavanaugh Second Accuser Was George Soros Open Society Fellow."" We reached out to editor-in-chief Patrick Howley with questions about why the article was deleted and how being a Soros fellow rendered one ""BUSTED"" but received no response. Another conspiratorial site, ShadOlsonShow.com, reported:You'd think they'd get more creative. Or, at least pick prettier girls.In any event, one of the first facts to surface after Ronan Farrow's latest adventure in nepotism journalism regarding Deborah Ramirez's predictable pile-on against Brett Kavanaugh: A hard and fast link to George Soros and his flagship societal destruction vehicle, Open Societies Initiative, or OSI.Turns out, besides being Brett Kavanaugh's Yale classmate who now alleges he exposed his penis and thrust it toward her face during a drunken dorm party at Yale in 1983, Deborah Ramirez's steepage in social justice warrior protocol was so ubiquitously undertaken that it earned her a 2003 mention as 'Senior Fellow' by George Soros' Open Society Initiative. The George Soros hits just keep coming and coming.:That story was also deleted. (We reached out to the email address listed on ShadOlsonShow.com, but our message bounced.)Unsurprisingly, Internet sleuths found a photograph of George Soros posing with a woman and claimed that woman was Christine Blasey Ford, when it was not. (The woman pictured with Soros was Ukrainian human rights activist Lyudmyla Kozlovska.)The information remained live on social media well after it was known to be false, thanks to Internet personalities with large followings who left it in place, including ubiquitous Trump Twitter cheerleader Jacob Wohl, who has 165,000 followers:I'm sure it's just a coincidence that the new Kavanaugh accuser, Debbie Ramirez, runs a Soros-backed SJW organization. It's also just a coincidence that Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer committed that from their story.-- Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) September 24, 2018:George Soros is often cited by more conspiratorial-minded adherents of right-wing politics as the mastermind behind what they view as the ills of the world (typically causes associated with social progressivism, as exemplified by the claim that he ""funded"" the 2014 Black Lives Matter protests against police violence in Ferguson)."
333,333,531.DoesanUpcomingMovieD,"Claim:""The Hunt,"" originally set for release in September 2019, will feature liberal or left-wing characters hunting supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump for sport. Rating:UnprovenAbout this rating Right-leaning websites expressed a measure of outrage in the summer of 2019 after details appeared to emerge about the content of the forthcoming Universal Pictures film ""The Hunt."":PJ Media reported that ""The Hunt"" ""depicts Trump supporters being hunted for sport by liberals,"" writing that:Universal Pictures is set to release a thriller called The Hunt on September 27, which features left-wing 'elites' hunting Trump supporters for sport. In the past few days we've been hearing a lot about how Donald Trump's rhetoric is apparently to blame for the El Paso shooting, yet Hollywood apparently lacked the foresight to think that a movie promoting violence against 'deplorables' might be in bad taste until after the shootings in El Paso and Dayton, as only now is Universal rethinking their promotional strategy for the film.The Epoch Times described ""The Hunt"" as ""a movie showing liberals stalking supporters of President Donald Trump,"" claiming that ""According to the Hollywood Reporter, the movie's script features blue-state characters choosing to hunt red-state characters who expressed pro-life positions or were deemed racist.""The conservative Blaze website similarly described ""The Hunt"" as a ""horror film about liberal elitists hunting 'deplorables.'"":Based on two official trailers released by Aug. 8, as well as unconfirmed script details reported by The Hollywood Reporter (THR), ""The Hunt"" appears to be a violent horror or thriller movie with a significant measure of social commentary, including contemporary U.S. political references. That would be in keeping with previous Universal Pictures/Blumhouse productions, including ""The Purge"" franchise.However, the ideology and political affiliation of the characters who hunt and kill what appear to be working-class people from largely rural areas remains unclear, despite the aforementioned websites' repeated and emphatic descriptions of them as ""liberal"" and ""left-wing"" elites. Notwithstanding the context of a fictional horror movie, it should be unnecessary to point out that hunting human beings for sport has never been a tenet of Enlightenment liberalism or modern-day American progressivism.Equally, it should be obvious to any mature consumer of culture that a movie that portrays wealthy psychopaths paying to hunt and kill other human beings is not likely to reflect well on the wealthy psychopaths, despite PJ Media's claim that ""The Hunt"" actually ""promotes violence against 'deplorables.'"":What We Know About ""The Hunt""The official Universal Pictures website for the film, which describes it as ""a new mysterious social thriller,"" contains the following plot summary:Twelve strangers wake up in a clearing. They don't know where they are, or how they got there. They don't know they've been chosen ... for a very specific purpose ... The Hunt.In the shadow of a dark internet conspiracy theory, a group of elites gathers for the very first time at a remote Manor House to hunt humans for sport. But the elites' master plan is about to be derailed because one of the hunted, Crystal (Betty Gilpin, GLOW), knows The Hunters' game better than they do. She turns the tables on the killers, picking them off, one by one, as she makes her way toward the mysterious woman (two-time Oscar(r) winner Hilary Swank) at the center of it all.Universal Pictures has also issued two official trailers as of Aug. 8. The first was released on July 12 and took the form of a parody of a promotional video for ""The Manor,"" a ""private hunting experience"" whereby wealthy customers could pay to hunt human beings. The second, more conventional trailer was released on July 30. :Neither trailer offered any insight into, or description of, the political ideology of the characters who run the human-hunting experience, although the second trailer did feature one of the characters (apparently one of those being hunted) delivering the following line: ""Every year, a bunch of elites kidnap normal folk like us and hunt us for sport."" Some of the characters being hunted identified themselves as hailing from Wyoming, Mississippi, and Orlando, Florida.The official synopsis of the film also provided no insight into, or description of, the politics of the ""hunters,"" although it, too, described them as ""a group of elites.""However, THR cited several alleged components of the script of ""The Hunt,"" which do offer such insights, if they are an accurate reflection of the film's final cut. In an article published on Aug. 6, THR cited unnamed sources in stating that Universal Pictures was re-evaluating their marketing and advertising strategy for the film in light of several mass shootings in the early days of August in the U.S. At least one of those massacres, at an El Paso, Texas, Walmart store, appeared to have been motivated by political ideology.:One source allegedly told THR that Universal Pictures had already withdrawn some s from circulation, though other studio sources supposedly said such a proposal was still being discussed. THR also reported that ESPN had withdrawn from circulation a planned  for ""The Hunt"" over the weekend of August 3-5. We asked Universal Pictures and ESPN whether they had each decided to withdraw such ads from circulation, but we received no response from either company in time for publication.THR's article described ""The Hunt"" in ways that were reflected in subsequent coverage on right-leaning websites, reporting that the film ""follows a dozen MAGA types who wake up in a clearing and realize they are being stalked for sport by elite liberals.""THR claimed to have seen the script for the film, which allegedly once had the title ""Red State Vs. Blue State,"" adding: ""The script for 'The Hunt' features the red-state characters wearing trucker hats and cowboy shirts, with one bragging about owning seven guns because it's his constitutional right. The blue-state characters -- some equally adept with firearms -- explain that they picked their targets because they expressed anti-choice positions or used the N-word on Twitter."":We asked Universal Pictures whether it could confirm the accuracy or authenticity of those elements of the script published by THR, but we did not receive a response in time for publication. It's unclear whether the script allegedly seen by THR was at an early stage of development, or a final draft, or whether those elements that suggest a liberal-conservative enmity between the characters made it into the final cut of the film itself.Without having confirmation of those important details or being able to watch ""The Hunt,"" we cannot confirm the accuracy of the claim that the movie features ""liberal"" or ""left-wing"" characters hunting ""Trump supporters"" for sport. As such, we are issuing a rating of ""Unproven,"" until and unless such corroborating evidence becomes available.On August 9, however, the studio announced they were canceling the film's release.As reported by The Associated Press, the film was eventually rescheduled for release on March 13, 2020. :"
334,334,129.DidPresidentObamaOnc,"Claim:A leaked email proves that President Obama once spent $65,000 of taxpayer money on hot dogs. Rating:FalseAbout this rating Make up your mind, conspiracy theorists. Is ""hot dog"" code for male prostitutes, or does ""hot dog"" simply refer to a food item?:In January 2019, President Trump was criticized for serving items from McDonald's, Burger King, and other fast food spots to the Clemson Tigers during a White House celebration of the football team's NCAA Championship. While a number of pundits defended Trump, saying the controversy was overblown, the conspiracy theory website InfoWars went a step further and maintained that the criticism was hypocritical, claiming that former President Barack Obama had once purchased $65,000 worth of hot dogs for a private party:""The left is mocking President Trump for providing a fast food buffet to a college football team, but emails obtained by WikiLeaks show that former President Obama flew in $65,000 worth of hotdogs from Chicago -- using taxpayer funds -- for a private party in 2009.""This argument was not made in good faith and was not based on any credible evidence.The notion that President Obama purchased $65,000 worth of hot dogs for a private party came from a single email chain published by Wikileaks in October 2012 as part of the so-called ""Global Intelligence Files."" This email was not sent by President Obama or any member of his administration; rather, the email chain, dated 14 May 2009, involved various employees at the intelligence company Stratfor discussing a ""Chicago Hot Dog Party."":Stratfor's Fred Burton responded to an email by writing, ""I think Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in pizza/dogs from Chicago for a private party at the White House not long ago, assume we are using the same channels?""This single message was not proof that President Obama ever purchased $65,000 worth of hot dogs. It was merely speculation (or possibly an attempt at humor) about a supposed exorbitant expenditure by the Obama administration. The email was not accompanied by any evidence to support its literal reading and did not originate with a member of the Obama administration or from anyone in attendance at the alleged hot dog party.It's possible that the original Stratfor email was misstating the facts about a Super Bowl viewing party hosted by President Obama at the White House in February 2009. The president did serve hot dogs at that party (as well as brownies, hot fudge ice cream, pizza, soft pretzels, chicken sandwiches, etc.), but we found no reports stating that he purchased $65,000 worth of hot dogs (at $3 a dog, that's more than 20,000 hot dogs) or that the treats were flown in from Chicago.:Interestingly, this isn't the first time this ""hot dog"" email has been used in an attempt to smear the Obama administration. Back in 2016, this innocuous email exchange was used to push the Pizzagate conspiracy theory. InfoWars head Alex Jones himself even claimed that ""hot dog"" was actually code for ""male prostitutes"":I learned this with Pizzagate and stuff. You've got admissions and thousands of emails about the kids will be delivered into the hot tub for your pleasure and then it's the FBI code words for sex with kids off their own homeland security manual and they're talking about $65,000 of succulent hot dogs. ""Oh God, these are good. I had these hot dogs in Hawaii and they were delivered by jet."" It's male prostitutes.And look, Obama's having sex with 10 dudes a day, whatever.While Jones once used the term ""hot dog"" to push a baseless conspiracy theory concerning pedophilia and sex trafficking, by January 2019 this code word for male prostitutes had reverted back to referencing an ordinary food item in order to launch a new (yet similarly baseless) attack on Obama.:We reached out to Pete Souza, Obama's official White House photographer, to determine if he had ever seen his former boss with a suspiciously large amount of hot dogs.  He told us, ""I shot almost two million photographs as the Chief Official White House Photographer during my eight years in the Obama administration. Every picture was transferred to the National Archives on 1/20/2017, and I can assure you there is not a single photograph of President Obama with 20,000 hot dogs."""
335,335,648.IsThailandBanningthe,"Claim:Because Thai Princess Bajrakitiyabha Narendira Debyavati fell into a coma weeks after receiving a third dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, the government of Thailand is banning Pfizer vaccines from the country and suing the company for damages. Rating:FalseAbout this rating ContextWhile Princess Bajrakitiyabha Narendira Debyavati has been in a coma since mid-December 2022, claims she had recently been vaccinated, that she had been vaccinated with a Pfizer shot, and that the Thai government was banning Pfizer shots as a result, all stem from a single scientist who has promoted a prolific amount of COVID-19 misinformation since early in the pandemic. Officials in Thailand have explicitly rejected that scientist's claims. :In early February 2023, anti-vaccine websites ran with a factually deficient story about a member of the Thai royal family -- Princess Bajrakitiyabha Narendira Debyavati -- falling into a coma. The event happened, allegedly, about ""23 days"" after she received her third Pfizer shot. While it was factually true that Bajrakitiyabha was (at the time of this reporting) in a coma that began when she fell ill on Dec. 14, any links to vaccination are entirely speculative, without evidence, and promoted by conspiracy theorists. Long-time COVID-19 conspiracy theorist Sharyl Attkisson, for example, claimed that:About three weeks after her third Pfizer booster shot, Princess Bajrakitiyabha Narendira Debyavati collapsed with heart issues and went into a coma.The 44-year old eldest daughter of the King in Thailand, and likely heir to the throne, had reported to be in excellent health prior to the vaccination and collapse[d] while training her dogs. [...]One authority recently suggested that Thailand was preparing to declare its contracts for Pfizer vaccine ""null and void"" and go after the vaccine maker for damages.:Anti-vaccine website Health Impact News made this same claim, explaining that it was based on an interview between Sucharit Bhakdi, a German-Thai retired scientist, and Pascal Najadi, a self-described retired Swiss banker attempting to sue the president of Switzerland for embracing the Pfizer vaccine: Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi, a German-Thai microbiologist, describes going to Thailand and informing the royal family that the health issues the Princess Bajrakitiyabha is experiencing have been caused by the COVID vaccines she received.Dr. Bhakdi claims that officials in Thailand are upset, and are taking actions to nullify their contract with Pfizer and will seek billions of dollars in compensation.Bhakdi is the purported ""authority"" cited by Attkisson, as well. In that interview, Bhakdi asserts as fact several things that are at best unsubstantiated. These include the assertion that the princess recently was vaccinated with a Pfizer vaccine and that the government of Thailand takes Bhakdi seriously:One daughter of the present king Rama X collapsed and is in a coma... within 23 days after the third shot, 44 years old, never been seriously ill, collapsed and is now in a coma. The diagnosis that was given by the authorities and by the university is so ridiculous - she's supposed to have a bacterial infection that will never do what she suffered from. And so we are determined, and the activists in Thailand who have been on this many many months now - great guys, also a professor from the University of Bangkok, he's gotten in touch with the Royal Family, and we are sending information to the Royal Family to alert them to the fact that in all probability the princess is suffering as a victim of this jab, as so many people around the world have been suffering.:First, it is a misreading of this statement to suggest that Bhakdi claims he spoke with any member of the Thai government or royal family directly. Based on the actual full interview, Bhakdi spoke with ""activists in Thailand"" who then claim to have sent that information to the royal family. Second, Bhakdi is not a credible source of information on COVID-19 or on vaccines. He is, in reality, an overtly anti-semitic conspiracy theorist and political figure who has been a repeated source of demonstrably false information about the pandemic since March 2020. He is the founder of an anti-lockdown political party in Germany that embraces several conspiracy theories about the virus.Third, the only source on the princess' vaccination status is Bhakdi, who does not state how or when he came across that information. There is, literally, no other source for the claim that the princess was recently vaccinated, or that such a vaccination, if it occurred, was a Pfizer vaccine. Fourth, nobody in the Thai government or Thai royal family has corroborated the claim that Thailand is abandoning the Pfizer vaccine or beginning any legal action against them. Such a claim merely represents a pipe dream discussed by two individuals steeped in COVID conspiracy theories on a YouTube channel that has, for some reason, been promoted as an authoritative source. :Fifth, and most authoritatively, is the fact that the Thai government has explicitly stated that the claims made by Bhakdi are false, describing them as ""fake news.""For all these reasons, the claim that Thailand is suing Pfizer over a coma their vaccine caused a member of the royal family is ""False."""

Ilhan Omar was wearing an ""Odal rune"" during an appearance on CNN.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On April 4, 2021, far-right social media troll Jack Posobiec posted a tweet that asked, ""Why was [U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.] wearing an Odal Rune?"":The so-called ""Odal rune"" was the focus of controversy in late February and early March 2021 when some on social media said the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference, a gathering of Republican Party figures, was shaped like the symbol. An organizer of the event pushed back on that claim.The simple answer to the question posed above is that Omar wasn't wearing an Odal rune. Omar responded to the tweet stating that the piece in question was Tuareg jewelry that she got while traveling in Niger. We will explain more about what an Odal rune is below.:An Odal rune is sometimes referred to as an Othala rune. The Anti-Defamation League, a prominent organization that researches and tracks extremism and hate, notes that the symbol originated as a pre-Roman alphabetical figure that acquired a new meaning after it was adopted by the Nazis:The othala rune is part of the runic alphabet system, a system of writing used (with many variations) across pre-Roman Europe. In the 20th century, Nazis in Germany adopted the othal rune, among many other similar symbols, as part of their attempt to reconstruct a mythic ""Aryan"" past. Nazi uses of the symbol included the divisional insignia of two Waffen SS divisions during World War II. Following World War II, white supremacists in Europe, North America, and elsewhere began using the othala rune. Today, it is commonly seen in tattoo form, on flags or banners, as part of group logos, and elsewhere.An Odal rune looks like a diamond shape with two lines extending past the bottom point. An image of one burning can be seen in this 2018 tweet from journalist Jack Smith::Omar's necklace can be clearly seen during her appearance on CNN on April 4 (screenshot below). It doesn't resemble an Odal rune::Omar's election to Congress in 2018 shattered a number of barriers. She is one of the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress, and the first naturalized U.S. citizen who is an immigrant from an African country to serve. As an immigrant, Muslim, and woman of color, she is, as we have previously reported, a frequent target of disinformation and smears, often transparently motivated by Islamophobia and racism.Posobiec is currently listed as a correspondent for the pro-Trump conspiracy outlet OANN. In the lead-up to the November 2016 election, he was a promoter of the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which posited that prominent Democrats including Donald Trump's then-political rival Hillary Clinton were running a child sex trafficking ring out of the basement of a Washington, D.C., pizza restaurant that had no basement. Pizzagate was a precursor to the Qanon conspiracy cult."

What's FalseAngeli did not join in the message of the BLM protest but rather went there to recruit followers of U.S. President Donald Trump and the QAnon conspiracy theories, both of which he has a long record of supporting. :In the aftermath of unprecedented rioting in the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021, attention turned to identifying those responsible, many of whom were photographed in the course of their criminal actions, and some of whom even recorded their own involvement in selfies and social media live streams.One of the individuals who featured prominently in press photographs and video footage from the rioting was a shirtless man who wore horns and furs on his head and had a painted face and tattoos on his body. Beginning on the afternoon of the riots, social media users and conspiracy theorists shared photographs of the man, Arizona resident Jake Angeli, juxtaposed to suggest that he had previously taken part in demonstrations organized by the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement and therefore was not, in fact, a supporter of outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump, but rather an agent provocateur or adherent to the antifa (anti-fascist) movement, seeking to discredit Trump supporters and efforts to overturn the victory of President-elect Joe Biden in the Nov. 3, 2020, presidential election.:The claims relating to Angeli formed part of a broader conspiracy theory of antifa and other ""leftist"" agitators infiltrating the mob of Trump supporters. As we outlined previously, proponents of these theories even falsely claimed that facial recognition technology had been used to positively identify the supposed antifa instigators. On Facebook, users widely shared a screenshot that included two photographs of Angeli, along with the caption ""AZ [Arizona] BLM rally in June, DC Capital [sic] in January""::Some social media users explicitly presented the photographs as proof that Angeli was ""antifa"" and ""not MAGA."" In reality, Angeli is an enthusiastic supporter of Trump with a long public record of promoting the bizarre and baseless ""QAnon"" cluster of conspiracy theories.The photograph on the right of the tweet -- which was originally published by Trump supporter Cari Kelemen -- showed Angeli taking part in the Capitol riots on Jan. 6, 2021. It was cropped from a larger photograph taken by Saul Loeb and published by Getty. The photograph shown on the left of the widely shared screenshot did show Angeli at a BLM demonstration in the summer of 2020, but it was cropped to occlude the fact that he was carrying a pro-QAnon sign, and failed to mention that Angeli had reportedly gone there not to take part in the main event, but to recruit others to his causes.It appears to have been taken by Brett Lewis, who emphasized on Twitter on Jan. 6 that Kelemen and others had misleadingly cropped it so that it no longer showed the QAnon-themed placard that Angeli was holding at the time. Lewis further explained that Angeli attended the BLM march in order to instigate conflict, not to join in the messages of other participants:::In October 2020, the Arizona Republic published an interview with Angeli, in which he railed against COVID-19-related mask mandates and promoted QAnon conspiracy theories, saying ""Q is about taking back the country from globalists and from communists. And they've infiltrated the news, they've infiltrated the entertainment [sic], they've infiltrated politics."":On his YouTube channel, Angeli has promoted a range of bizarre conspiracy theories, including some related to alien life, ""spiritual warfare,"" child sex trafficking cabals, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and ""globalist elites.""On the social networking website Parler, Angeli described himself as a ""shamanic practitioner"" and ""QAnon digital soldier,"" and largely posted links to his own YouTube videos."

339,339,690.DidPastorRickWilesCa,"Claim:Rick Wiles said U.S. congressional impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump amounted to a ""Jew coup.""Rating:Correct AttributionAbout this rating In late 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about reports that Rick Wiles, a controversial right-wing pastor, had launched a virulently anti-Semitic attack on leading congressional Democrats, claiming that impeachment proceedings against U.S. President Donald Trump amounted to a ""Jew coup."":Such reports were published by the Times of Israel, and the websites BoingBoing.net and RightWingWatch.org, among others. Those articles were accurate. On Nov. 22, Wiles dedicated an entire 97-minute episode on his online channel TruNews to what the episode billed as ""Jew Coup: Seditious Jews Orchestrating Trump Impeachment Lynching.""What Wiles said:Wiles has repeatedly indulged and promoted anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and tropes on his channel, as documented by the Anti-Defamation League. The president's son, Donald Trump Jr., drew criticism in March for agreeing to be interviewed by TruNews, despite its record of promoting conspiracy theories and inflammatory misinformation, and the channel has been given access to White House press conferences, and been allowed to put questions to President Trump. In his Nov. 22 episode, Wiles continued that pattern of anti-Semitic attacks on perceived opponents of Trump, hitting on virtually every age-old myth and trope about Jewish people and targeting named, individual members of Congress, deploying false, outrageous, and at times downright bizarre slurs against them. The episode was removed by YouTube for violating its rules on hate speech, but as of Nov. 27, the video remained on the TruNews website and Facebook page, and was still available through iTunes as an audio-only podcast. This fact check contains, by necessity, virulently anti-Semitic language that some readers might find offensive. :Towards the beginning of the episode, Wiles set out his thesis statement:""The 'Impeach Trump' movement is a Jew coup, plain and simple. The men and women who are the driving forces to remove Donald J. Trump from the White House are Jews. America is in the throes of a political coup led by Jews. President Trump is surrounded by a rabid pack of seditious, treacherous Jews who are intent on overthrowing the votes of millions of Christians who elected him in 2016.""At several points, Wiles used language that suggested civil war was inevitable in the United States, as a result of the fictional ""Jew coup,"" and in one instance appeared to encourage a violent ""backlash"" against a non-existent Jewish plan to ""kill millions of Christians.""In one instance, his co-host Doc Burkhart parsed a campaign ad by U.S. Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va., suggesting that a reference in the ad to ""all enemies, foreign and domestic"" (from the congressional oath of office) meant she was accusing Trump of being such a domestic enemy. Wiles shot back ""I consider these Jews to be domestic enemies! These are seditious, treacherous Jews who are undermining the president of the United States and pushing this country to civil war."":He later mused: ""This country could be in civil war at Christmas time. Members of the U.S. military are going to have to take a stand, just like they did in the 1860s with the Civil War ... People are going to be forced, possibly by this Christmas, to take a stand, because of this Jew coup in the United States. We have weeks to stop it.""Towards the end of the broadcast, Wiles urged his viewers: ""There is going to be a backlash. If there isn't a backlash, the country is over, you have been taken over by a Jewish cabal, a Bolshevik revolution ... Get it through your head! They're coming for you! There will be a purge, that's the next thing that happens when Jews take over a country -- they kill millions of Christians!""Wiles labeled Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a ""lying, Jewish congressman,"" adding: ""That's the way the Jews work. They are deceivers, they plot, they lie, they do whatever they have to do to accomplish their political agenda.""Wiles parroted Trump's epithet of choice for the influential chair of the House intelligence committee, calling him ""Shifty Schiff"" and launching a bizarre, personal attack on him::""His eyes -- he freaks me out, Doc, there's something wrong with that man. Seriously, mentally there's something mentally wrong with that man ... He looks demon-possessed. Honestly, Adam Schiff looks like a mental psycho. He creeps me out.""Wiles then deployed yet another age-old calumny against Jewish people, implying that Schiff's true loyalties did not lie with the United States: ""And he's chairman of the House intelligence committee? Oh boy, I wonder how much intelligence is flowing to Israel.""The Florida-based pastor labeled Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union and a key witness in impeachment hearings, a ""treacherous, lying, deceiving Jewish operative."" On more than one occasion, Wiles likened Jews to animals and carriers of disease -- a notorious, anti-Semitic rhetorical device that was used most damagingly during the rise to power of the Nazis in 1930s Germany.He said the list of participants and witnesses involved in the Ukrainian controversy, which has been a key focus of impeachment hearings so far, was ""infested with Jews"" (Congress is investigating whether Trump asked Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and family in exchange for military aid). Wiles also claimed that a group of ""treacherous, seditious Jews"" were ""surrounding the president like a pack of wolves."" He described Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, another key witness in the impeachment hearings and a Purple Heart recipient, as a ""treacherous snake."":The depths of anti-Semitism to which the program sank was perhaps best summed up in a moment when Burkhart referred to the ""Protocols of the Elders of Zion,"" an early 20th century fabricated document that purported to be a record of a Jewish conspiracy for global domination, but was later definitively shown to be a hoax.""Protocols"" is a quintessential example of deliberately inflammatory, anti-Semitic disinformation, and was widely deployed by the Nazis as propaganda in order to vindicate the annihilation of the Jewish people. Burkhart mused: ""Some say it's fake, I believe there's a lot of truth to it."" Wiles added: ""Whoever wrote it back in the 1800s, they accurately predicted what was going to happen in the world."""
340,340,540.PresidentialTrivia50,"Every year, on the third Monday in February, the U.S. federal government honors the birthday of the country's first president, George Washington, by closing most of its agencies, promoting ceremonies nationwide that recognize all presidents' lives.To mark the holiday, commonly known as ""Presidents Day,"" we combed through Snopes' archives to select memorable fact checks involving commanders-in-chief over the decades. We found numerous instances of social media users sharing quotes that were falsely attributed to presidents, as well as rumors that tried to prove presidents' lack of mental fitness by alleging various social faux pas. Mixed in with those accusations were photographs that supposedly depicted presidents hanging out with their political enemies or controversial figures.Meanwhile, the archives included exclusive pieces of trivia regarding presidents' pets, drinking, alleged extramarital affairs, purported after-death hauntings of the White House -- and more. :Below are 50 confirmed facts or nuggets of political folklore that stood out to us during the analysis. They are listed in order of presidential term.(Former and current Snopes staff members contributed to this report, and all images are available via Wiki Commons unless otherwise stated.)11. No, George Washington didn't have wooden teeth.He wore several different sets of dentures over the course of his lifetime, none of which were made of wood. Rather, dentists used the cutting-edge materials of the time, such as bone, gold, the castaway teeth of horses, donkeys, cows and ... human beings. (Fact check here.):22. During the Revolutionary War, George Washington ordered mass immunizations to protect his troops from smallpox. At the time, people giving inoculations basically infected recipients with a weak case of smallpox by cutting into their flesh and implanting a pustule into the wound. (Fact check here.)33. Thomas Jefferson is responsible for a saying popular among groups that support some sort of violent uprising.For instance, a 2001 op-ed in The Atlanta Constitution included the quote -- ""The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants"" -- in a piece that published a few days after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and called on young people to sacrifice and join the military. (Fact check here.):44. For more than a century, people have shared a story about how John Quincy Adams kept an alligator as a pet in the White House.As the legend went, he and his family shared the West Wing with the giant reptile. But no records documented the purported living arrangement to prove the tale true. (Fact check here.)55. As an Illinois state legislator in 1942, Abraham Lincoln jumped out of a window in an attempt to prevent a quorum.Surprisingly, that was not the only story about him making that type of exit for political purposes. (Fact check here.):66. Lincoln expressed his opposition to racial equality.While campaigning for the U.S. Senate in 1858, he said, ""I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and Black races,"" according to newspaper archives. (Fact check here.)77. Lincoln's last words will likely forever be debated.Christian McWhirter, a historian at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Illinois, said the best guess is based on a writing by one of Lincoln's friends just five days after his assassination. (Fact check here.):88. Many people believe the ghosts of Lincoln and his family haunt the White House.The White House Historical Association has even compiled a list of the reported sightings and encounters. But, like all spectral sightings, these stories are hard to prove.[See also: ""Did Abraham Lincoln's Ghost Appear in an 1972 Photo?""]99. Andrew Johnson was the first president in U.S. history to be impeached.Only three presidents have been formally impeached by the House of Representatives: Johnson, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump (twice). Richard Nixon was nearly impeached but left office before a vote was held. (Fact check here.):1010. Ulysses S. Grant predicted the next civil war would be ""between patriotism and intelligence on one side, and superstition, ambition, and ignorance""The quote from 1875 circulated on social media in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. (Fact check here.)1111. Grant supposedly once handed out an exploding cigar that paid off decades later.According to the unfounded legend, he handed out an exploding cigar that missed the person who was its original target but squarely struck one of his relatives several decades later. (Full analysis here.):1212. No, the Baby Ruth candy bar was not named after Grover Cleveland's daughter, Ruth Cleveland.She died of diphtheria in 1904, over 17 years before the ""Baby Ruth"" bar was first produced. (Fact check.)[See also: ""Did US $1,000 Bill Feature President Grover Cleveland?""]1313. Before Trump's election in 2016, William McKinley was the last president who did not have a dog.McKinley's successor, Theodore Roosevelt, had a dog named Skip, and every president since then (excluding Trump) followed suit. (Fact check here.):1414. A young Theodore Roosevelt was photographed in a distant window during Abraham Lincoln's funeral procession.Thirty-six years after the photo was taken in New York, Roosevelt took the presidential oath of office. (Fact check here.)1515. In 1903, Theodore Roosevelt ordered a local post office to suspend operations after residents forced a postmaster to resign because she was Black.Roosevelt forced the post office in Indiananola, Mississippi, to pause services and requested that Minnie Cox, the Black postmaster, be allowed back to her job. She never returned, though mail restarted the following year. (Fact check here.):1616. Warren Harding supposedly once rashly gambled away White House china on a single hand of poker.Though the story is widely shared about the 29th president, no documentation or evidence definitely proves its veracity. (Fact check here.)1717. In 1931, radio announcer Harry von Zell once referred to him as 'Hoobert Heever.'Zell was reading a lengthy recounting of Hoover's life when he flubbed the president's name. (Fact check here.):1818. To check if people were listening to him at a party, Franklin D. Roosevelt supposedly told people that he had murdered his grandmother.A journalist recalled the scene in a book, saying all but one person did not pay attention to Roosevelt's bizarre remark. The one person who did, a Wall Street banker, reportedly responded: ""She certainly had it coming."" (Fact check here.)1919. FDR was the first president to deliver a televised speech in 1939.Decades later, Joe Biden erroneously claimed that Roosevelt had actually addressed television viewers about the stock market crash -- though, in reality, that economic crisis happened during Hoover's presidency, when TVs were not a household item. (Fact check here.):2020. Harry S. Truman called the use of 'socialism' a 'scare word.'The remark -- which he made during a 1952 speech in New York -- circulated in meme form during Trump's presidency, when Republicans warned of ""radical"" Democrats ""embracing socialism."" (Fact check here.)2121. No, Dwight D. Eisenhower was not a member of a so-called 'Global Antifascism Initiative.'As commander of the Allied forces in World War II, he indeed helped defeat fascism. But an image supposedly showing his lifetime ""antifa membership card"" is the work of digital editing. On top of that, there's no evidence that a group with that name even exists. (Fact check here.):2222. An unsubstantiated, long-held rumor is that Eisenhower's mother was biracial.Eisenhower's racial background has sparked a number of popular stories over the years, but there's no compelling evidence to support such claims. (Fact check here.)2323. While John F. Kennedy reportedly had numerous extramarital affairs with women, there's no evidence that Nancy Pelosi was among them.In 2011, Nancy Pelosi posted a photograph of her standing next to the former president, and, later, internet users used that image to spread the unsubstantiated rumor that the two had supposedly hooked up for seven years. (Fact check here.):2424. When JFK took office, he was the richest man ever to do so.He donated his entire presidential salary, as well as his congressional earnings, to charity. (Fact check here.)2525. Yes, viral photographs show JFK's bloodstained shirt from the day he was assassinated.A 2021 TikTok video put renewed focus on the historical artifacts, and, no, Kim Kardashian does not own them. (Fact check here.):2626. We know what JFK was going to say in a speech that was scheduled on the day of his assassination.The remarks, which he never gave because of the fatal shooting at Dealey Plaza in Dallas, included the statement: ""Our duty as a party is not to our party alone, but to the nation, and, indeed, to all mankind."" (Fact check here.)2727. Despite championing the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, Lyndon B. Johnson was also a sometime racist and notorious vulgarian.He rarely shied away from using the N-word in private conversations. However, it's unproven whether he said this quote frequently attributed to him: ""I'll have those n-----s voting Democratic for 200 years."" (Fact check here.):2828. Lyndon B. Johnson once sent a letter to the Smothers Brothers lauding their humor at the expense of his administration.The letter to the comedy-variety program read: ""It is part of the price of leadership of this great and free nation to be the target of clever satirists."" (Fact check here.)2929. No, Richard Nixon was not the original Gerber Baby.If there's one thing we've learned from watching ""Futurama,"" it's that you just can't trust Zapp Brannigan. (Fact check here.):3030. Nixon allegedly ordered a nuclear strike on North Korea while drunk.But, as the story went, his inner circle convinced him to hold off on such a decision until sobering up. (Fact check here.)3131. Nixon once told his security advisers to write the phrase 'the press is the enemy' 100 times to supposedly commit the idea to memory.He was not a fan of a free press. (Fact check here.):3232.

(Fact check here.):3434. Nixon has been the subject of UFO conspiracy theories over the years.Supposedly, Nixon hid a time capsule in the White House containing evidence of alien life and human contact with extraterrestrials. But there is no verified evidence to prove that theory true. (Fact check here.)3535. Yes, Jimmy Carter once helped contain a potentially dangerous accident at a nuclear reactor in Canada.The incident took place before his presidency, in 1952, when Carter was a young naval officer. (Fact check here.):3636. Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, are the longest-married couple in presidential history.As of summer 2021, they had 75 years under their belt. (Fact check here.)3737.

""[Don't] let the critics discourage you or push you off course."" In other words, he did not sulk or criticize the opponent who had defeated him. (Fact check here.)4040. In 1995, Bush senior resigned from the NRA.He was a Life Member of the NRA, but not for his whole life. (Fact check here.)4141.

(Fact check here.)4343. No, George W. Bush was not arrested by U.S. Special Forces, nor was he hanged at Guantanamo Bay.These rumors are just a sample within the genre of fictional storytelling about politicians' arrests or executions. The stories' trademark style -- laughable dialogue and anonymous ""sources"" inside elite and secretive U.S. military circles -- are very familiar to Snopes' fact-checking team. (Fact check here.) (Fact check here.)4444. Barack Obama was born in Hawaii.As we originally wrote here, groundless skepticism about the legitimacy of Obama's citizenship developed into ""birtherism"" -- a labyrinthine conspiracy theory holding that he was born on foreign soil, lied about being born in Hawaii, and produced a forged birth certificate. None of these claims were supported by evidence. (Fact check here.)[See more fact checks about Obama here.]4545. A digitally edited image of a college ID was used as alleged proof of the 'birther' conspiracy theory.In 2012, the image of an ID card surfaced online, supposedly identifying Obama as a foreign student named ""Barry Soetoro"" who attended Columbia University in the 80's.

(Fact check here.)4848. Joe Biden did not poop his pants with the Pope, but he did mangle several speeches.Since Biden took the presidential oath of office on Jan. 20, 2022, the Snopes newsroom has spent numerous hours looking at visual evidence or listening to audio of him on the job to see whether he had accidentally defecated on himself, fallen asleep, farted, or stumbled his speech.[We compiled all of those alleged social faux pas here, and we analyzed the media trend here.]4949. Joe and Jill Biden met on a blind date organized by his brother.Despite social media posts claiming otherwise, Jill Biden was not a teenager working as the Biden family babysitter when she started dating Joe.

341,341,397.TheOtherkinPolicyatK,"Claim:A high school in Indiana sent out an email informing teachers of a new ""otherkin policy"" to accommodate students who identify as part animal. Rating:Originated as SatireAbout this rating Fact CheckIn April 2022, another dubious rumor about schools installing litter boxes for students who identify as part-animal was circulated online. This time, the rumor came in the form of a fake email that was supposedly sent out to teachers at Kokomo High School informing them of a new ""otherkin policy."" ::This is not a genuine email about a new ""otherkin policy"" that was sent to teachers at Kokomo Highschool. This is a piece of fictional content that originated with a satire site. The above-displayed image comes from the ""Kokomo Press,"" a Facebook page that labels itself as satire. In its about section, the page states that the ""Kokomo Press"" is a reinvention of a previous satire page, the Kokomo Scanner. This rumor about an ""otherkin policy"" is a riff on a previous bit of disinformation that went viral thanks in part to the ""LibsofTikTok,"" a social media account that frequently posts anti-LGBTQ content, often packaged alongside false rumors. The Washington Post reported:Her anti-trans tweets went especially viral. She called on her followers to contact schools that were allowing ""boys in the girls bathrooms"" and pushed the false conspiracy theory that schools were installing litter boxes in bathrooms for children who identify as cats. She also purported that adults who teach children about LGBTQ+ identities are ""abusive,"" that being gender-nonconforming or an ally to the LGBTQ+ community is a ""mental illness,"" and referred to schools as ""government run indoctrination camps"" for the LGBTQ+ community.:Rumors about schools installing litter boxes weren't confined to the internet. Some Republican lawmakers took these false rumors seriously and mentioned them on social media and during debates. The Guardian reported:A Nebraska state lawmaker apologized on Monday after he publicly cited a persistent but debunked rumor alleging that schools are placing litter boxes in school bathrooms to accommodate children who self-identify as cats.State senator Bruce Bostelman, a conservative Republican, repeated the false claim during a public, televised debate on a bill intended to help school children who have behavioral problems. His comments quickly went viral, with one Twitter video garnering more than 300,000 views as of Monday afternoon, and drew an onslaught of online criticism and ridicule."
342,342,411.DoesMicrosoftOwnPate,"Claim:Microsoft owns patent ""666,"" which involves inserting microchips into people to mine their activity for cryptocurrency purposes. Rating:Mostly FalseAbout this rating What's TrueMicrosoft published a patent for a ""cryptocurrency system using body activity data."" This patent is filed under the number WO2020060606A1.What's FalseThe number WO2020060606A1 contains three ""6's"" but is obviously not the same as ""666."" This patent focuses on tracking body activity via wearable technology, such as a smart watch, and makes no mention of implanted microchips. :Snopes is still fighting an ""infodemic"" of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

The spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease in 2020 sparked a flurry of conspiracy theories concerning where it originated, how it spread, and who was responsible for it. One such theory blamed the disease on Bill Gates and claimed that the former Microsoft CEO had started a pandemic so that he could insert microchips into people around the globe under the guise of providing vaccinations or for other purposes. This conspiracy theory is propped up by little more than coincidences and misinterpretations. For instance, in April 2020 social media users started to share a link to a patent supposedly owned by Microsoft that pertained to the micro-chipping of individuals for financial gain.::This patent was especially insidious, users claimed, because it carried the numbers ""666,"" the biblical ""mark of the beast,"" and the letters WO, which they claimed stood for the ""World Order.""  :The above-displayed screenshots pertain to a genuine patent filed by Microsoft. However, this patent does not involve a plan to microchip individuals, ""WO"" does not stand for World Order, and one has to ignore the existence of 11 other characters in order to arrive at the conclusion that this patent carries the devil's number.  This patent is for a ""cryptocurrency system"" that ""uses body activity data."" Microsoft Technology Licensing applied for this patent in June 2019, and the patent was published a few months later in March 2020 under the number ""WO2020060606A1."" The patent, which has not been granted as of this writing, makes no mention of microchips.The diagrams included in this patent (and shown in the screenshots above) show how the ""person,"" ""user device,"" and ""sensor"" are all distinct items. The text of the patent further explains that the ""user device"" in the diagram may include wearables, such as a smart watch, or cell phones, laptops, or tablets::User device 130 may include any device capable of processing and storing data/information and communicating over communication network 120. For example, user device 130 may include personal computers, servers, cell phones, tablets, laptops, smart devices (e.g. smart watches or smart televisions). An exemplary embodiment of user device 130 is illustrated in FIG. 6.The patent provides two options for the sensor. First, the sensor could be incorporated into one of the aforementioned devices, such as a smartphone. The ""sensor"" may also be its own standalone component:Sensor 140 may be configured to sense the body activity of user 145. As illustrated in FIG. 1, sensor 140 may be a separate component from user device 130 and be operably and/or communicatively connected to user device 130. Alternatively, sensor 140 may be included and integrated in user device 130. For example, user device 130 may be a wearable device having sensor 140 therein. The sensor 140 may transmit information/data to user device 130. At no point in this patent does Microsoft suggest that the sensor would be a microchip implanted into a person's skin.:So what about the claim that this is World Order patent 666? As we noted above, this patent was truly published under the number ""WO2020060606A1."" It truly contains the number 666 (or, more accurately, 060606). However ""patent WO2020060606A1"" is not the same as ""patent 666."" Furthermore, the ""WO"" at the start of this patent does not stand for ""World Order."" It is shorthand for WIPO, the World Intellectual Property Organization, which issued this patent. The ""A1"" at the end of this patent number signifies that this is only a published patent. The ""kind code"" B1 is applied to granted patents. We reached out to Microsoft for more information about this patent and will update this article if we hear back. To sum up: Microsoft has applied for a patent that deals with the development of a cryptocurrency system based on tracking body-activity data. However, this patent focuses on wearable technology, such as a smart watch, not implanted microchips, and while patent number ""WO2020060606A1"" contains three ""6's,"" this appears to be little more than a coincidence. :"
343,343,25.TheRootsofPedophileR,"Conspiracy theories involving outlandish fantasies of ""elite"" pedophile rings may have gained modern day prominence in the disorienting frenzy that characterized the lead-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, but they are nothing new. They also don't show any signs of going away.The current crop, at least, took root with what became known as ""Pizzagate."" Promoters of that conspiracy theory in 2016 used social media platforms to make unfounded but viral allegations that Hillary Clinton and other prominent Democrats were running a pedophile ring out of the basement of a Washington, D.C., pizzeria -- even though that restaurant had no basement.Since then, the dark theme of Pizzagate has found new life with permutations forming part of the Qanon conspiracy theory, incorporated under the umbrella term ""pedogate."" The gist of the pedogate conspiracy theory is that global elites -- politicians, celebrities, and wealthy businesspersons -- are covertly involved in a far-reaching ring that trafficks young children for sexual purposes.""What most of these conspiracy theories involve in one way or another is laying accusations of pedophilia or involvement in pedophile rings at the feet of people that they despise or hate, and Clinton being the ultimate example of that,"" said Mark Pitcavage, senior research fellow for the Center on Extremism at the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). ""The idea is if you hurt the enemy, then what you like will benefit, and with Pizzagate it would have been [Clinton's 2016 rival] Trump."":Pizzagate originated with an Internet-based crowd the ADL has termed ""alt right"" and ""alt lite,"" far right extremists who range from outright white supremacists to those who publicly shun racists but otherwise fall in step with their belief systems. Pizzagate jumped from the fringes to the mainstream because as it denigrated Hillary Clinton, it sucked in supporters of then-candidate Donald Trump.While junk news sites have kept a steady drip of pedophile-oriented stories pulsing through the Internet's blood stream since then, the conspiracy theories jumped from cyberspace into the real world in the summer of 2018.In June, a group calling itself ""Veterans on Patrol"" stumbled into an apparent homeless encampment in Tucson, Arizona. Helped along by social media and with signal boosts from junk sites such as BigLeaguePolitics.com and conspiratorial sites like TheFreeThoughtProject.com, the group claimed they had in fact found a site used by child sex traffickers. Before long, Cemex, the Mexican-owned cement company whose property the camp happened to be on, was accused of being involved in the non-existent pedophile ring at the site. Police found no evidence that the location was used for any nefarious activity.:Most recently in August 2018, Portland's Voodoo Doughnuts and Toronto's Sweet Jesus ice cream shop were targeted by Internet instigators who accused the businesses of housing pedophile rings. Again, police found no evidence of any such thing taking place at those locations.These stories may be new (if lacking in creativity), and the digital platform for their delivery may be new as well, but they employ a centuries-old tactic: playing on deep-seated human anxieties by conjuring images of imperiled children, said University of Alabama historian Margaret Peacock.The most recent example in the modern era of a phenomenon with a similar theme was the satanic panic of the 1980s, in which a wave of hysteria over alleged child molestation at daycare centers swept the nation. But while that phenomenon was a moral panic attributable, at least in part, to social anxiety over white middle class women entering the work force en masse for the first time and entrusting their children to others, the current conspiracy theories about pedophile rings equate to propaganda, Peacock said. They carry a danger for stirring up violence.:""If you want to elicit violent action the way to do it is through hate and fear,"" Peacock told us. ""Once you target and label a population as pedophiles, you can do anything you like to that population.""That's not to say fears of child abuse or sex trafficking are unfounded. Peacock told us plenty of terrifying real-world examples are out there to draw from:It's Important to remember that conspiracy theories like this are expressing the fundamental currents of a society. Conspiracy theories and myths never work unless you've got existing material in society to use. You have real, terrifying revelations that thousands of children were being abused in the Catholic church for decades. These were in fact terrifying child sex rings organized by the very population that we are most inclined the trust -- the priests.The International Labor Organization reports that 25 percent of the world's 40.3 million victims of human trafficking are children. The most vulnerable, according to the National Human Trafficking Hotline, are migrants, runaways, the homeless, and youngsters who have been victims of violence.:Despite their obsession over the topic, conspiracy followers aren't worked up about those children who are in true harm's way. ""In the world of propaganda, it's never about real children. Instead, it's about what children represent."" The children imperiled by conspiracy theories, in other words, are only metaphors, Peacock said:Children carry a vast amount of weight in any society, but especially modern ones when they're expected to survive past the age of five. It wasn't as intense before the 18th century when child mortality rates were really high. They represent the future, and all that is beautiful and decent and honest in a society, because they are innocent. For the vast majority of people also, the meaning of their existence is rooted in their children.Children are eschatological, they represent death for us, and what is coming behind us after we are gone. They also represent the threat of loss -- if they disappear, if they die, that is the death of society. That's why they became so crucial and central to Cold War propaganda. The real terror of the nuclear holocaust would be the death of the children, because that's the death of everyone.:That explains why recent police investigations into the conspiracy claims came up empty. (Portland police Sgt. Christopher Burley told us detectives attempted to contact the person accusing Voodoo Doughnuts on social media of running a pedophile ring. The accuser did not cooperate with investigators.)The pendulum of conspiracy theories about systematic child abuse has swung back and forth for centuries. Peacock cited examples such as blood libel, when Jewish communities were attacked over false allegations of murdering and consuming Christian children in the Middle Ages. ""During the Thirty Years War [in Europe in the 17th century], entire villages were put to the sword because it was believed they were abusing children of the other religion,"" she said.One characteristic that helps Pizzagate-style conspiracy theories gain popularity is that they function like a puzzle game, Pitcavage explained:A lot of conspiracy theories are oracular, where the information comes form one source -- an oracle. Then there are others where there are a few people who promote the notions, almost like gurus or a conspiracy priesthood. But Pizzagate, it's more of what I would call a participatory conspiracy theory. Participatory conspiracy theories lay out a scenario or situation and then they ask their audience, 'what more can you find out about this, what more can you add?' It turns the audience into willing participants.The thing about participatory conspiracy theories is it can really create a devoted following because it gives people something to do, it makes them feel they can solve the whole thing or uncover new aspects to it. Once you get that energy going it's almost self-sustaining.:Followers of the Qanon conspiracy theory, for example, are called ""bakers"" because their protagonist ""Q"" pops up on Internet message boards and leaves ""crumbs"" (i.e., clues), and they are tasked with picking up the crumbs in order to solve the puzzle. (""Q"" is supposed to reference the character's government security clearance level). Q followers believe an even more deranged version of Pizzagate, as RationalWiki describes it:QAnon, also known as The Storm and Calm Before The Storm, is a conspiracy theory, popular meme, and right wing fantasy that originated in a series of incoherent posts on 4chan in 2017 by someone calling themselves QAnon. Following on the heels of similar bullshit such as Pizzagate, it advances a fantastic web of deceit that wraps up Trumpism, deep state fearmongering, evil, satanic pedophilia rings controlled by the Democratic Party, investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 US election, the Las Vegas shooting, and New World Order paranoia into a package easily and wholeheartedly promoted by internet cesspools and Alex Jones.The Storm's central premise is that President Trump is secretly working to take down a global ring of elite, cannibalistic, satanic pedophiles. And the investigation into Russian meddling into the 2016 election, led by former FBI director Robert Mueller, is actually an investigation into the so-called ""deep state"", where a cabal of evil, money-grubbing globalists, including Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, are responsible for everything from a global pedophile ring to the mass shooting in Las Vegas in 2017.:According to the enlightened, when Trump awkwardly took a drink from a bottle of Fiji water at a press conference in November 2017, it wasn't because he was thirsty; it was actually a secret signal to those in the know that the Storm of annihilation of deep state pedophiles had begun (or was about to begin). Because as everyone knows, Fiji is a hot spot for child trafficking.So, while the shit was supposed to hit the fan in November 2017 with mass demonstrations and the suppression thereof, a military coup, the arrest of hundreds of public officials, and the fact that November came and went without any of these things happening does not appear to have had any effect on the theory's overzealous supporters. On the contrary, it appears it has made it even more popular.The role the Internet and social media play in helping to spread such unmitigated insanity can't be underestimated. Just a few decades earlier, conspiracy theorists would identify each other using letters to the editor printed in newspapers and magazines, said Kathryn Olmsted, a historian at the University of California at Davis:It was a lot harder to identify your fellow conspiracy theorists. You would have to physically meet to swap your stories, or send letters or call. They would set up these groups that would communicate by newsletter. They would meet in a physical space, like someone's living room. Now obviously it can go much more quickly, because you can identity people immediately. You can quickly share ideas and the data you've collected.:The Internet allows such people to exist in bubbles where they rarely have their beliefs challenged, Pitcavage said. ""The extraordinarily polarized society we're in right now has made people less willing to seek out other view points,"" he said. ""Because of the Internet there's less need to do so.""And there's very little incentive to look outside one's own bubble once they have become invested in a conspiracy theory, Peacock said:Once you start to act out on those behaviors you are forced to double down by repeating the act to prove it was a just act. Eventually you get caught up in a movement that totally defines your conscious and you can't get out of it. The second you step out of that world view your actions go back to being reprehensible.Sandy Hook hoaxers who believe the 2012 mass shooting at the eponymous elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, was faked by the government have stalked, harassed, threatened and generally tormented the parents of the children murdered in that tragedy.:Pitcavage said he knows of no historical precedent to which he can compare the current spate of conspiracy theories, which he called ""nihilistic"" and seeking only to tear down the notion of objective fact: ""I just don't know where it's going to end. I see no signs of it slowing down or the country slapping itself awake and coming back to its senses. A substantial portion of the country is in sort of a fever dream of conspiracy theories, and I don't know when we'll come out of it."""
344,344,342.MediaOutletTheBLEvad,"In a series of reports published between October and December 2019, Snopes exposed an Epoch Times-linked media outlet called The Beauty of Life (or The BL) for inauthentically amplifying its content using a massive network of fake Facebook profiles. Part of a sprawling web of loosely connected pro-Trump media properties associated with a spiritual movement known as Falun Gong, The BL played a clumsy game of cat and mouse with journalists --  adapting their methods as previous tactics were exposed.In our three months' of coverage, for example, the profile photos used by the outlet's fake accounts shifted from stolen pictures, to obvious stock photos, to computer-generated faces incapable of being reverse-image searched. Ostensibly, that game came to an end in late December when Facebook removed the entire network for coordinated inauthentic behavior and blocked all links to The BL from being shared.Here, Snopes reports that The BL briefly found a way around that link-sharing ban by making a complete clone of The BL -- branding it as a new, unrelated website that goes by the name The Lion. The BL did not respond to our request for comment. The Lion lists no contact person, and its ""About us"" page is blank. This quick-fix operation was no less clumsy or obvious than any of The BL's previous attempts to circumvent Facebook's policies. On Aug. 4, Snopes reached out to Facebook seeking comment on The Lion; a link ban was placed on The Lion the following day. In response to our query, a Facebook spokesperson simply directed us to their ""Continuous Enforcement"" policies that monitor ""efforts to re-establish a presence on Facebook by networks we previously removed for CIB [Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior]."":TheLionTimes.com was registered on July 5, 2020 -- about six months after The BL was banned from Facebook. All of the stories on The Lion, which appear without any author byline, can also be found on TheBL.com (where they do contain an author byline). In most cases, all you need to do to find The BL version of a story that appears on The Lion is to swap out ""theliontimes"" with ""thebl"" in the URL::Outside of a shared URL structure, the site betrays other tell-tale signs that both websites are drawing from the same database of material in a coordinated way. The post ID (i.e., the number assigned to the story in each website's database) is identical between outlets, as is the timestamp. This holds true even for stories published by The BL well before The Lion existed.Despite only a month of existence, The Lion found a large and receptive Facebook audience in pro-Trump or conspiracy theory-focused groups. An article published two days after The Lion's creation garnered over 93,000 Facebook interactions and over 14,000 shares, according to CrowdTangle data downloaded on Aug. 4, 2020::Snopes discovered this scheme in part because several articles from The Lion were shared amongst a network of far-right, Islamophobic Facebook pages associated with fringe evangelical figure Kelly Kullberg -- a network Snopes first reported on in May 2019."
345,345,162.DidPfizersFormerChie,"Claim:Michael Yeadon, who wrote that ""there is absolutely no need for vaccines to extinguish the pandemic,"" was once Pfizer's chief scientific officer. Rating:Mostly FalseAbout this rating What's TrueUntil 2011, Michael Yeadon worked in a drug discovery research unit within Pfizer and was a vice president and chief scientist of that specific division, which focused on allergy and respiratory medical research. His views on COVID-19, lockdowns, and vaccination have elevated his position on some corners of the internet, despite a scientific rationale for those claims that has since been proven to be unambiguously incorrect. What's FalseYeadon's title was not ""chief scientist of Pfizer,"" ""chief scientific officer of Pfizer,"" or ""vice president of Pfizer."" The division he ran had nothing to do with vaccines or infectious disease and at the time of its closure in 2011, was focused on developing compounds that targeted asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.:Snopes is still fighting an ""infodemic"" of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help. Find out what we've learned and how to inoculate yourself against COVID-19 misinformation. Read the latest fact checks about the vaccines. Submit any questionable rumors and ""advice"" you encounter. Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. Anti-vaccine and medical conspiracy theory websites often cite a former Pfizer employee named Michael Yeadon as their source. Yeadon, who left Pfizer in 2011, has made several controversial claims since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. As vaccination efforts ramp up across the world, a statement he made in October 2020 is being reshared in meme form to sow doubt about the necessity of vaccination::Narrowly speaking, this fact check concerns the accuracy of the title media reports and memes have ascribed to Yeadon, which generally identify him as some variation as the former ""chief science officer,"" ""chief scientist,"" or ""vice president"" of Pfizer.  While Yeadon himself has not presented his credentials in that manner, reports ascribing such titles to him add gravitas to his inaccurate claims about COVID-19.More broadly speaking, however, the reemergence of his five-month-old quote offers a great opportunity to see how Yeadon's oft-cited pronouncements about the COVID-19 pandemic have held up. As it turns out, they have been, to put it mildly, alarmingly incorrect. The quote on vaccines stems from a broader argument he made that claimed, due to purported preexisting immunity to COVID-19, that the pandemic ended in October and that there would be no second wave globally or in his home county of the U.K.In other words, regardless of who he is or where he once worked, Yeadon's argument that there is ""no need for vaccines"" relies on a series of assumptions that predicted the worst of the pandemic was behind us in October 2020. As that claim is self-evidently ridiculous, his conclusion on vaccines is entirely without merit.:""Viruses do not do waves,"" Yeadon wrote about two months before the second COVID-19 wave dwarfed anything the U.K had seen previously during the pandemic.   Yeadon Was Never 'Chief Scientist of Pfizer'In reality, a scientist named Mikael Dolsten has served as the Chief Scientific Officer for Pfizer since May 2010, when he replaced a man named Martin Mackay. In Dolsten's capacity as Chief Scientific Officer, he is President of Pfizer's Worldwide Research, Development and Medical (WRDM) organization.Pfizer's WRDM has historically contained several different ""therapeutic area"" research units. Until 2011, one of those was the Allergy and Respiratory Unit. It was this specific division within Pfizer's WRDM that Yeadon served as vice president and chief scientific officer. Dolsten significantly downsized the number of WRDM therapeutic areas at Pfizer, and the company closed the U.K.-based Allergy and Respiratory unit in 2011.:At the time of its closure, Yeadon's unit was focused on ""developing compounds that target two of these diseases that affect the lower airways -- asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and also diseases of the pulmonary vasculature,"" according to a 2010 Pfizer report.Memes Reference a Flawed Prediction From October 2020The Yeadon quote, commonly presented in an anti-vaccine context, was taken from an Oct. 16, 2020 post Yeadon wrote on a U.K.-based blog named Lockdown Sceptics. In that piece, he argued that the U.K's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) -- a medical body that makes recommendations about lockdowns and other COVID-19 health measures -- relied on faulty numbers to calculate the level of risk posed by COVID-19.He argued the group's models were ""fatally flawed"" because they did not account for people previously exposed to other milder coronaviruses that imparted some level of protective immunity, and because they relied on blood antibody tests that did not detect the specific antibodies imparted by these milder coronaviruses, broadly termed common cold coronaviruses (CCCs).:Yeadon's arguments referenced research or reporting that came out in August and September 2020. At the time, studies showed that blood taken from dialysis patients before the pandemic demonstrated that a large portion of the population's immune systems already possessed some ability to at least recognize and fight SARS-CoV-2, which is the virus that caused COVID-19.""It is hypothesized, but not yet proven,"" the August 2020 study's authors wrote, ""that this might be due to immunity to CCCs."" Such findings, a September 2020 BMJ editorial posited, ""may force pandemic planners to revisit some of their foundational assumptions about how to measure population susceptibility."" Due to this purported pre-existing immunity, Yeadon argued that in October 2020 about 30% of the globe had some level of immunity to COVID-19 as opposed to the 7% estimated by SAGE.""Based on this belief, Yeadon wrote that ""there is absolutely no need for vaccines to extinguish the pandemic."" He argued that ""at a national level, the greatly reduced proportion of the population that remains susceptible now means we will not see another large, national scale outbreak of COVID-19."":To take Yeadon's October 2020 statement about vaccines seriously, therefore, one also has to defend the claim that a second coronavirus wave never hit the U.K. Such a claim is comically indefensible. The chart below shows new COVID-19 cases in the U.K. by day. The highlighted data point, Oct. 16, 2020, is the day Yeadon published his article. That large spike beginning in December is the second wave that Yeadon said would never come::Yeadon structured his article by highlighting what he believed to be flawed assumptions made by SAGE. It is perhaps ironic, then, that a flawed assumption is what led Yeadon awry. Yeadon's assumption -- one that the very papers he referenced cautioned against making --  was that the antibodies potentially derived from previous CCCs can effectively or meaningfully prevent infection from SARS-CoV-2. By December 2020, it became clear that this was not the case.The Bottom LineIn a November 2020 commentary piece concerning preexisting immunity to COVID-19 published in the medical journal JAMA, public health officials and immunologists concluded that ""achieving herd immunity through natural infections will take years of painful sacrifice that are tallied in numerous deaths, severe long-term health sequelae, and widespread economic disruption and hardship.""The only hope to avoid such an outcome, the authors concluded, was vaccination. ""Let us hope that safe and effective vaccines help avoid the consequences of naturally developing herd immunity to COVID-19,"" the authors of the piece wrote in November 2020. At the time of this reporting, those vaccines appear to be doing just that.:Broadly speaking, the argument Yeadon made to caution against vaccines is based on conclusions which the passage of time has already exposed as woefully misguided. Narrowly speaking, however, the claim that a former ""Chief Scientist"" or ""Vice President"" of Pfizer made these vaccine skeptical comments is ""Mostly False"" because Yeadon, while being employed by Pfizer, never held such a senior position at the company."
346,346,429.TheFarRightRiotersat,"This article about terrorist groups is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.Some Republican congressional leaders, including U.S. Reps. Matt Gaetz, Mo Brooks and Paul Gosar, along with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, joined President Trump in trying to pin the violent siege of the U.S. Capitol building on antifa, a loose movement of left-wing, anti-racist and anti-fascist activists. The FBI negated the baseless claims, and people have recognized the conspiracy theory as a false flag - an act designed to disguise the actual source or responsible party and implicate another.In contrast, members of extreme right-wing groups like the boogaloo movement and the Proud Boys did in fact infiltrate the George Floyd protests this summer, trying to spark violence between Black Lives Matter protesters and police. :And at the Capitol, it appears Proud Boys members hid their affiliation to better blend in with the crowd.As an expert on terrorist tactics and propaganda, I am well acquainted with the idea that far-right militants sometimes try to hide their own identities.Terrorist deception is an age-old tactic. Deception helps terrorist groups innovate by allowing them to learn, master and experiment with new tactics while protecting their identities and reputation.  The guise of mimicryThe most obvious form of deception - mimicry - is emulating the specific tactics and strategies of other groups.The history of suicide terrorism, for example, is replete with examples of contagion and mimicry. Suicide terrorism spread from Iran to Lebanon to Sri Lanka to the Palestinian territories. It has been used by at least 58 different groups in 35 countries. :Just as plants and animals mimic other species to lure prey or hide from predators, mimicry enables violent groups to portray themselves in a variety of guises for both offensive and defensive purposes.Mimicry might involve imitating actions or behavior. An al-Qaida member in Europe, for example, might disguise himself by drinking alcohol, going to strip clubs or gambling. This deceptive signaling can help him move easily among Western targets and not raise suspicion. Mimicry can also be changing one's physical appearance. In the case of terrorist operations, groups blend into their surroundings, or don the uniforms of rival groups to sow confusion. They might change their looks and attire to mimic something less threatening - for example, a pregnant woman - to evade detection or invasive searches.In 2005, Raghab Ahmad 'Izzat Jaradat of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad armed group detonated an explosive belt aboard a bus near Haifa, Israel. He wore an Israeli army uniform and carried a conscript bag to avoid drawing attention. This became a common tactic used by Hamas militants to infiltrate Israeli hard targets.:False claims of responsibilityDeception can also take the form of mimicry when a group makes a false claim of responsibility or attributes a failed operation to their enemies or rivals. Willingness to claim responsibility or allocate blame depends on whether violent tactics are popular or unpopular with their constituency of supporters and whether they succeed or fail. The Islamic State, for example, rarely claimed responsibility for failed attacks. Groups might falsely claim responsibility to garner publicity, while the actual perpetrators might want to avoid responsibility. Al-Qaida didn't immediately claim responsibility for the 9/11 attacks, although subsequent statements and comments left no doubt as to their culpability. The reasons for this reticence relate to their goals at the time: to demoralize the West, galvanize Muslim extremists and instigate armed conflict with the West in Afghanistan and elsewhere. From this perspective it didn't matter which faction perpetrated the attacks.:Following an August 2001 suicide bombing at a Sbarro pizzeria in Jerusalem, multiple Palestinian terrorist organizations claimed responsibility for the attack. As a result, the group that was in fact responsible, Hamas, developed mimic-proof signatures such as recording videos in advance in which the bomber claims responsibility for the attack. These videos branded Hamas' ownership of attacks and undermined the reputations of rival groups who falsely claimed the attacks as their own. This innovation is now a norm and has changed the way terror groups convey ownership.Deceiving MAGAThe Jan. 6 attack at the Capitol was not antifa. The arrests thus far have been dedicated Trump supporters, based on their social media posts. But in the ultimate form of deception, a post allegedly from the Department of Justice's acting pardon attorney appeared on Parler, the now-suspended social network app popular with the far right and people who've been kicked off of Twitter. It requested individuals who had stormed the Capitol to provide their name, address, license information and details of what they did that day in order to receive a pardon.:The real Justice Department hastily issued a statement advising Trump supporters that ""the information circulating on social media was inauthentic and should not be taken seriously.""A few days later, the FBI opened numerous investigations of assault and seditious conspiracy based in part on information gleaned from social media. Mimicry is both offensive and defensive. Just like with predators and prey in nature, when it comes to acts of terrorism, what you see is not always what you get.Mia Bloom, Evidence Based Cyber Security Program, Georgia State UniversityThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

347,347,455.DidRudyGiulianisHair,"Claim:Photographs show U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, with hair dye melting down his face during a news conference. Rating:Mostly TrueAbout this rating What's TrueThe photographs are genuine. What's FalseThe makeup of the substance is unknown. :On Nov. 19, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who was hired by Trump's reelection campaign to file legal challenges to the results of the 2020 election, gave a conspiracy theory-laden news conference alleging widespread voter fraud. While Giuliani urged viewers to take his evidence-free claims seriously (BBC's Americas Bureau Chief Paul Danahar called it the ""most unsubstantiated diatribe"" he had ever witnessed), much of the conversation on social media dealt with some odd images of New York City's former mayor that reportedly showed dark streaks of hair dye running down his face::This is a genuine photograph of Giuliani during his news conference that was taken by Tom Williams. The image is available via Getty Images along with the caption:UNITED STATES - NOVEMBER 19: Rudolph Giuliani, attorney for President Donald Trump, conducts a news conference at the Republican National Committee, on lawsuits regarding the outcome of the 2020 presidential election on Thursday, November 19, 2020. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)There are several additional pictures of Giuliani from this news conference with dark streaks running down his face. The following photo, for example, was taken by Sarah Silbiger of The Washington Post: WASHINGTON, UNITED STATES - NOV 19: Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump, speaks during a news conference about lawsuits related to the presidential election results at the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington, D.C., on Thursday Nov. 19, 2020. (Photo by Sarah Silbiger for The Washington Post via Getty Images):While these photographs are undoubtedly real, there is some debate over what caused the dark streaks down Giuliani's face. While most social media users presumed that it was melted hair dye, some hair care experts disagreed. David Kholdorov of the Men's Lounge Barbershop and Spa on Manhattan's Upper East Side told The New York Times: ""Hair dye doesn't drip like that, unless it's just been applied."" Mirko Vergani, the creative color director at the Drawing Room, said that the streaks may have been caused by mascara that was applied to the sideburns: ""Sideburns are more gray than the rest of the head ... You can apply mascara to touch the gray side up a bit so it looks more natural.""Slate also launched an investigation into the strange streaks With the help of Nicole Wingo from Washington D.C.'s Barber of Hell's Bottom, they concluded that it was likely some sort of pomade with a semi-permanent coloring effect::WINGO: The hair journey that these guys are on is definitely a wild one. I think something like that is probably the result of a tinted product. I wouldn't think that that was a demi-permanent or semi-permanent color. I would think it's a topical product, like a pomade or a tinted gel that got really ... gooey.SLATE: So this is not a product you're familiar with or use with your clients? Would this be the kind of thing you'd buy at the drug store?WINGO: This is not something that I've seen on my clients. The only products I can think of that offer a color payoff in addition to a styling component are gray products that you see at the drugstore or darker gels or pomades. As far as higher-end things go, I don't know of any topical products that have pigments in them for just like a day on the town, you know? I would guess that something like this is the $8 to $15 range.While Giuliani's streaks stole the show at this news conference, the event also gave reporters plenty to discuss. For instance, Giuliani, at one point, invoked a character with notoriously bad eyesight from the movie ""My Cousin Vinny"" to make a point about observing poll watchers from an appropriate distance.  As for the rest of Giuliani's news conference, Fox News reporter Kristin Fisher said that most of what Trump's personal lawyer alleged was ""simply not true""::"

At this stage, we advise readers to take individual rumors and memes that appear to be blooming out of this alleged hack with a grain of salt. This is not to say that this material should automatically be presumed to be false (or true). Rather, it's simply the case that the 4chan message board has a long history of delivering up questionable content, none of this material has yet been verified as authentic, and partisans on both sides of the political divide are likely to try to recast it to their advantage. (For example, earlier today we debunked a doctored photograph unrelated to the 4chan leak that was apparently being circulated as a ""counter-meme"" to discredit that leak.)According to The Daily Dot, which reported on the alleged ""data dump,"" the specific thread on 4chan, which contained quite a bit of adult content, claimed to have uncovered somewhere around 450 GB of various ""voice mails, videos, voice recordings, [and] pictures,"" some of which featured both Hunter and the president.:The 4chan thread was first posted around July 8 on the /pol/ board on the website, a board named ""Politically Incorrect.""

349,349,589.HaveSixtyHolisticDoc,"Claim:In just over a year, more than sixty holistic health practitioners have died suspicious deaths, and the media refuses to acknowledge that these deaths might be linked.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 19 June 2015, a controversial doctor named Jeffrey Bradstreet was found dead in a river by a local fisherman from what the local sheriff's office later determined was a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his chest. Bradstreet was an outspoken proponent of the discredited theory that vaccines cause autism, as well as a practitioner of and an evangelist  for a fringe remedy derived from human blood known as GcMAF (illegally advertised as a cure for everything from cancer to autism).:His death came just days after his Georgia clinic was raided by the federal agents looking for GcMAF or other unlicensed medical treatments. On the day he was found, a Swiss clinic associated with a company that Bradstreet had frequently promoted and which used GcMAF, was raided after five patients died (though it is not clear if those five patients died from GcMAF or some other cause).His family, not convinced in the official conclusion that his death was a suicide, hired a private investigator to look for indications of foul play, which provided fodder for internet conspiracy theorists -- many suggested he had been murdered by someone working for the pharmaceutical, medical, and regulatory establishments.Erin Elizabeth, the founder of Health Nut News, has taken this sentiment and run with it, arguing that Bradstreet's death was not only suspicious, but far from an isolated incident. Her post on Bradstreet provided a gateway into what would become the central focus of her work over the next year and a half -- unraveling the mystery around what she claims are the suspicious deaths of over 60 doctors of holistic medicine.:Her efforts have caught the attention of countless other conspiracy-minded web sites, including Natural News and Alex Jones' InfoWars. Aspects of the narrative are allegedly being developed into a movie, and on 30 April 2017, Elizabeth was featured on an episode of Investigation Discovery Channel's ""Scene of the Crime, with Tony Harris"" that focused on Bradstreet's death.Elizabeth first wrote about Bradstreet's death on 23 June 2015, in a post implying (but not demonstrating) there was more to the story than met the eye, and citing Bradstreet's family and friends' doubt over the official cause of death as proof. Building off of the success of that article, Elizabeth has expanded what she calls her ""unintentional series"" to include over 50 posts on Health Nut News.Frequent ""breaking"" headlines and Elizabeth's repeatedly stated fears for the safety of partner, Joseph Mercola, a prominent holistic doctor with an extensive web site, have added a sense of urgency. Her posts, often devoid of details that provide any tangible link between events, almost invariably tie the deaths if not directly, then by not-at-all-subtle innuendo, to the conspiracy narrative created in the Bradstreet story.:This-bait-and-switch started right away. For example, in her report on the case of chiropractor Bruce Hedendal on 1 July 2015, who was found dead in his car, reportedly of natural causes, she implies (but never expands on) a link to Bradstreet:The second doctor is Dr. Bruce Hedendal, DC, PhD  of Boca Roton, Fl. who died suddenly on Father's Day, leaving behind a beautiful family. Sources tell me that he was found dead in his car; there had been no accident and it wasn't running. He had exercised earlier at an event, but we don't want to speculate as the authorities have yet to rule on his cause of death. [...]Both Dr Hedendal and Dr. Bradstreet had dealt with run ins with the feds in the past. In fact, Dr. Bradstreet's office was just raided by the FDA days before he died.In this post, we critically and systematically examine each person that Elizabeth has included in her series to see if suggestions of linked causes or outright conspiracy hold up. In doing so, we demonstrate that Elizabeth's series fails to a) coherently articulate the conspiracy, b) consistently utilize the same list of victims, or c) demonstrate any connection between the victims whatsoever.:What Is the Conspiracy?Elizabeth, who repeatedly stresses that she has no proof of a connection between any of these cases, generally suggests that there have been a large and underreported number of holistic doctors whose deaths were suspicious or unexplained. In its early iterations in the summer of 2015, the claims suggested a local Florida connection (Bradstreet had moved from Florida to Georgia), as she wrote in the 21 July 2015 post:Yet another doctor was just found murdered inside his home here on the East Coast of Florida. This makes six doctors to be found dead in the last month, from this region of the country alone. Four out of the six were found dead here in Florida.As the series progressed, however, the geographic and chronologic window widened, with later reports coming from numerous states across the U.S., Canada and Mexico, the Caribbean island of Grenada, and the United Kingdom. Chronologically, the series has expanded retroactively to include incidents that predate Bradstreet's death, going back as early as the summer of 2014.:Other aspects of the story that have been broadened with its telling and retelling are the defining characteristics of the alleged victims of the conspiracy. In some cases, the doctors that Elizabeth includes have no connection to holistic medicine whatsoever (despite her headlines), and in other cases the link to holistic medicine is extremely tenuous and based on observations such as liked Facebook pages, veganism, or an openness to preventive medicine. Elizabeth herself does not offer any suggestions or explications for motive, but strongly suggests the link lies within their alternative approach to medicine, as she does in her most recent recap of the ""series"":Some of the biggest skeptics, those who rolled their eyes at the first few deaths, are now wondering if there isn't a connection. There have been theories, from GcMAF to CBD oil, but I don't think all doctors used both of these treatments. I'm not convinced either is the smoking gun, but might hold part of the answer.There are several unsolved murders here (and some alleged suicides, most still under investigation), and I sincerely hope they get to the bottom of this as again, we knew several of these amazing doctors personally.:The dubious (and unsubstantiated) shared connections of GcMAF and CBD oil -- a non-psychoactive component of cannabis used primarily for pain management -- among these doctors is about as close to a motive as you will find on Health Nut News. Still, it has been enough fodder for others to attach their own pet theories to--some conspiracy peddlers focus on GcMAF despite the fact that almost none of the other doctors were involved in it, while others tie the conspiracy more generally to the heavy-handed interference of the federal government.Who Are the Victims?Elizabeth claims that ""well over 60"" victims, who are ""mostly holistic"" doctors have died suspiciously. She has not published a definitive list, but when she recaps the growing list of departed doctors, she posts a photo montage of the alleged victim's faces.Without a clear tally from Elizabeth, we took it upon ourselves to generate a list of the doctors whose deaths she has said were suspicious. The task proved complex because many of her reports come with the caveat that they are ""not part of the official series"" but are nonetheless included in her photo montage. Elizabeth told us via email that this inconsistency stems from advice she got from a reporter::After talking to a seasoned reporter in NY, I decided he was correct I couldn't pick and choose who to put into this 'series' so I included all of them and usually wrote about right after their deaths were announced.Our list includes 61 doctors (provided for your own fact-checking pleasure on this Google spreadsheet) and is derived from Elizabeth's posts, reverse image searches of the collage of victims' faces, and discussions with Elizabeth herself. 56 of the doctors on our list come from her collage (which includes two duplicate faces). Elizabeth sent us links to an additional five posts about deaths that she has not yet included in the photo montage.:As we will show below, of these now 61 doctors, all but five can easily be excluded from any conspiracy attacking alternative medical practice. The remaining five cases, while perhaps not without some intrigue, are far from sufficient proof of of any large scale conspiracy against alternative health practitioners.Elizabeth Herself Has Already Excluded 14 of the 61 CasesAs Elizabeth's conspiracy claims have expanded, she has taken to posting about deaths that even she admits are not part of her list of dead holistic doctors. Yet, she includes these doctors in her photo montage and has posted about ""questions"" surrounding their deaths on Health Nut News.These fourteen doctors include five chiropractors who died in car accidents (Chris Coffman, David Knotts, Thomas Eynon, William Snow and Janelle A. Bottorff) introduced with this caveat:I'm not including these officially in my holistic series of doctors who have been found dead or murdered, but have had more than one of their patients write me saying that they would like me to do a story on them.:Elizabeth also wrote a post about four doctors (none of whom practiced any form of alternative medicine) killed in accidents (Christopher Spradley, Robert Grossman, Anthony Keene and Dick Versendaal) that come with this caveat:I don't think these four in accidents were probably foul play. I just included them as a few asked me to. These doctors weren't holistic (that I know of- I haven't researched) I guess the lesson is that wearing a helmet, even when simply riding a bicycle, doesn't necessarily protect you. It also shows how quickly our lives can be taken away from us or those around us so treasure every moment with your loved ones.Another six posts about individual doctors' deaths come with disclaimers or updates admitting that their deaths were not mysterious. Despite that admission, Elizabeth continues to include their faces on her dead doctor collage. These doctors, only three of whom practiced alternative medicine, are Jamie Zimmerman, Nabil El Sanadi, Lorraine Hurley, Kenneth Rich, and Alan Clarke.Seven of the Remaining 47 Cases Can Also Be Excluded as Accidents:We found another seven cases that are clear and incontrovertible accidents -- though Elizabeth has not admitted as much. This includes John Louis Lombardozzi, a chiropractor killed in a motorcycle accident  (listed as suspicious because he was an ""experienced rider""); Wade Shipman, an osteopath who died in a bike accident; John A. Harsch, a holistic doctor killed in a car accident; Thomas Bruff, an occupational medicine doctor who died in a plane crash; Mark Buller, a bioterrorism expert who died after being struck by a car; and surgeon Anita Kurmann, who was killed in a bike accident. Finally, Linnea Veinotte, a researcher who had a teaching post at St. George's University in Grenada, was killed in a hit-and-run for which the perpetrator later turned himself in.Fourteen of the Remaining 40 Cases Are Murders Unrelated to a Medical ConspiracyFourteen of the doctors in Elizabeth's series were murdered. Although each case is disturbing, in all but one the likely perpetrator has been identified -- and in the remaining case, the victim was a retiree who clearly posed no threat to the medical establishment.:One of the cases Elizabeth most often refers to in hers series is that of Teresa Sievers. Dr. Sievers was involved in holistic medicine and her murder was complex and mysterious enough to be featured on the CBS program ""48 hours."" However, the investigation ultimately ended in the arrest of her husband on the suspicion that he paid a man to kill her for a life insurance payout. The case is still working its way through the courts.Another notable case involved the brutal and premeditated killing of a Southern California doctor who combined conventional and holistic medicine, Weidong ""Henry"" Han. Dr. Han, along with his wife and five year old daughter, were killed by a former business partner for financial gain, as reported by the Associated Press:A California man was charged Tuesday with murder in the slaughter of the family of a Chinese herbalist, including his 5-year-old daughter, in a crime authorities say might have been caused by a business dispute.Pierre Haobsh, 26, of Oceanside was charged with murder with special circumstances that he used a handgun, killed for financial gain and committed multiple killings.Santa Barbara County prosecutors have not decided whether to seek the death penalty. [...]A loaded gun and property belonging to one of the victims was found inside the car where Haobsh was arrested, Sheriff Bob Brown said last week.:As horrific as this event was, the likely perpetrator in this case was known to the victim, making it unlikely to be part of a larger conspiracy. The same can be said about these deaths included in the Health Nut News series:Jenny Shi, acupuncturist (murdered by her sister-in-law, charges based on DNA evidence)Tiejun Huang, Chinese medicine practitioner (killed by a man who believed the victim was having an affair with his wife)Lisa Riley, osteopath (killed by her husband, a boxer named ""Terrible Thomas"" with a history of domestic violence)Vibeke Rasmussen, professor and holistic doctor (killed by a mentally disturbed neighbor who lived across the hall)Ronald Schwartz, doctor (killed by a former employee)Mary Yoder, chiropractor (poisoned by an ex-employee that once dated her son)Robert Sowers, chiropractor (killed in a murder-suicide by the husband of his receptionist)Juan Gonzalez, naturopath (killed by the husband of a former patient over complaints his expensive herbal remedies were not curing her cancer)Ferdinand 'Fred' Mejilla, chiropractor (killed in a murder-suicide by the husband of his receptionist, who was also once his patient):Three more doctors were murdered in three random acts of violence that, despite involving assailants unknown to the victims, involved either a perpetrator who is now in custody, or a victim not plausibly related to any medical or regulatory conspiracy:Jessica Colker, wife of a holistic doctor (killed by a convicted rapist recently released from jail who later turned himself in)Mark Ernsting, cancer researcher (killed in a robbery gone wrong by a man caught on surveillance footage who has a criminal record)Mary Rene Bovier,retired chiropractor (killed by an unknown assailant in an unoccupied house she kept her cats in)Ten of the Remaining 26 Cases Involve People With No Tie to Holistic Medicine In many instances, Elizabeth includes individuals in her ""series"" who have no documentable tie to holistic medicine. Among the most tenuous connections to holistic medicine is the case of Cheryl Deboar, who was employed in a non-research role at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and had a degree in chemistry.:Also notable is the inclusion of Jeffrey Whiteside, a pulmonary/critical care doctor who, despite a complex and potentially mismanaged investigation that ultimately concluded that his death was a suicide, did not practice or have ties to any form of alternative medicine. Elizabeth uses the problems in the investigation to generate suspicion but fails to make any link to a larger narrative about the threat she thinks alternative medical practitioners are facing.Other tenuous connections included in this category:Hakeem M. Abdul-Karim, dentist  (who died of a heart attack and whose proffered connection to holistic medicine is based on pages he liked on Facebook and his use of the term ""preventative dentistry"")Nadeera De Silva, clinical cancer researcher (who did not practice holistic medicine)John Marshall, surgeon (whose connection to holistic medicine comes entirely from a Facebook comment left on Health Nut News's page)Christopher Robert, chief of anesthesiology at the Hennepin County Medical Center (with no proffered tie to alternative medicine):Rose Polge, junior doctor (a 25 year-old British junior doctor whose alleged connection to holistic medicine is her support of a junior doctor strike in the UK in April 2016)Laura Skellchock, dermatologist (Primarily a cosmetic dermatologist known for her work treating excessive sweating with botox, whose purported connection to holistic medicine comes from her background in integrative medicine and general interest in wellness and nutrition)Robert Ashton, thoracic Surgeon (who took his life two weeks after a divorce from his wife, whom Elizabeth connects to holistic medicine through her role as an ABC News correspondent whose former boss was anti-vaccine)Jerome Block, medical doctor (who had recently been convicted of medicare fraud, and who had jumped to his death in a clear suicide)11 of the Remaining 16 Cases Cannot Plausibly Be Considered Suspicious In ten of the remaining cases, the cause of death is known and generally accepted. This includes the death of Alfredo ""Dr. Sebi"" Bowman, an alternative health guru and traditional healer who died in an Honduran jail where he was being held on money laundering charges. Bowman was an important figure in the alternative health world, but conditions in Honduran prisons are notoriously harsh, crowded, and unsanitary, making it unsurprising that an 82 year-old with pneumonia did not survive his detention there.:Similarly, 56 year-old anesthesiologist and libertarian presidential candidate Mark Feldman, who was anti-vaccine, died in a motel where he was found by an unidentified woman. Authorities determined that his death was caused by a heart attack.In other cases, Elizabeth barely makes an attempt to draw the deaths of these individuals into a larger narrative, as with chiropractor Armon Burt -- the victim of a heart attack whose inclusion in the series stems from Elizabeth's barely-articulated hunches that minor details surrounding his death are strange:Dr. Armon Bert, who was reported missing by his family, was found in his car in the parking lot of a Kirkwood Lowes store (St Louis suburb), the ""apparent' victim of a heart attack (how do they clock his death at exactly 10:04 AM if they found him in the car?).The remaining cases here are those in which Elizabeth challenges the reader to prove a negative -- that there is not evidence that it wasn't suspicious -- without providing any tangible evidence that there is cause to doubt the official cause of death::Michelle M. Hartley, holistic doctor (a 32 year-old who died of a heart attack and for whom Elizabeth provides no additional information).Paige Adams, nurse practitioner (Elizabeth uses her support for Bradstreet to make her death look suspicious, despite the fact her obituary clearly states she died of Lyme disease).John Hicks, a medical doctor with some alternative medical views (who died of a heart attack)Marie Paas, a holistic doctor (who apparently committed suicide in Georgia, and whom Elizabeth learned about entirely from Facebook posts).Bruce Hedendal, chiropractor (a 67 year-old found dead in his car of reported natural causes).Baron Holt, chiropractor (whose ultimate cause of death is not reported online, but whose obituary mentions ""health problems"" albeit ones that they had assumed were not life threatening).Jyrki Suutari, chiropractor (who took his life on Mother's Day 2016)Finally, Rod Floyd, a professor at Palmer College of Chiropractic, whose suicide Elizabeth casts doubt on by saying that she heard things but is unable to elaborate on them as ""even [she] doesn't know all the details."" There is no verifiable evidence of foul play in his death.:Five Cases Involving 'Holistic Doctors' RemainAfter eliminating the above 55 doctors from the ""official unintended series"", we are left with only five cases involving individuals who practiced some form of alternative medicine and whose death could arguably (though this is a stretch) look suspicious. This includes the death of Jeffrey Bradstreet (discussed earlier), the incident that spawned this whole ""series"" in the first place.Elizabeth includes another indisputably prominent figure in the alternative medicine scene, Mitchell Gaynor, in her series. As with Bradstreet, Gaynor's death was ruled a suicide, which Elizabeth questions for spurious reasons. She argues that Gaynor, who supplemented his traditional treatment with natural remedies, wouldn't have committed suicide because he had recently beat the flu and survived a car accident:I'm confused because his close friend and patient (also a doctor) told me that they were told he had walked away from a car accident, but then days later he was found in the woods at his country home in Upstate New York.I'm also confused because posts on his personal Facebook page (which you might only be able to see if you are friends with him or have mutual friends) had colleagues saying that they were so sorry he missed the conference he was supposed to attend last weekend because allegedly he said he had the intestinal flu.So, let's say the information we were given was true. Let's say he survived a car accident (we don't know the details yet) and walked away from it, then he gets the intestinal flu (apparently survives that too) and then kills himself (allegedly in the woods at his country home, according to a patient and friend)?:We are unsure what these details have to do with his state of mind, but it should be noted that surviving both the flu and a car accident are not necessarily indicators of mental health.The other notable figure is Nick Gonzalez, an oncologist who practiced controversial and unproven alternative cancer treatments. Gonzalez died at age 67 of cardiac-related issues. His death sparked its own conspiracy theories and memes, as he once joked that pharmaceutical companies might target him for his work, as Vitality Magazine reported:The keynote speaker at this year's Whole Life Expo is Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez of New York, one of a small number of doctors whose success in treating cancer exceeds that of mainstream oncology by a wide margin. His work thereby puts the lie to pharmaceutical propaganda that fuels a cancer industry bringing in hundreds of billions of dollars while fooling millions of desperate and bewildered patients. ""I've been told drug companies know about my work but hope I get hit by a bus,"" Dr. Gonzalez observes wryly.The two remaining cases included here involve people who had connections to holistic medicine, but were far from national figures in the movement and could barely be considered primary targets for a hit job:Curtis Clogston, a medical doctor (who had at one point wrote about acupuncture and whose body was found in his car near his house after having been missing for a disputed amount of time)Alex Shvartsman, a holistic dentist (who also reportedly committed suicide, but whose death Elizabeth categorizes as suspicious because ""his patients are posting on my Facebook page (and sending emails) that they don't believe it was suicide""These five cases, and perhaps even some suicides mentioned above, form a kind of Rorschach Test -- if you are looking for evidence of a plot against alternative medical practitioners, you will likely be drawn to them.However, recognizing that nearly every story included in Elizabeth's ""unintended series"" is demonstrably unrelated to each other means that any conspiracy made must be crafted from the deaths of three prominent doctors -- plus two doctors who, despite having experience with alternative medicine, were not national figures or a plausible threat to any medical establishment.A Collection of Unrelated Tragedies As we reported in the earliest debunking of this conspiracy theory, between 6,500 and 8,200 doctors can be expected to die each year in the United States alone. These five deaths over the span of a year and a half, from a statistical standpoint, are not abnormal. Further, outside of vaguely defined philosophical beliefs, there is absolutely no connection between any of them.In fact, amongst the whole series, the only true defining similarity between all the cases described on Health Nut News is that Elizabeth promises to keep people updated on their developments if they join her email list.Because the claim of ""over 60"" dead doctors cannot be demonstrated even by Elizabeth herself, and because nearly all of the cases she uses can be easily excluded from a larger conspiracy, we rate the claim as false.There is no conspiracy afoot. Instead, there are simply 61 individual tragedies that have been inelegantly strung together by an alternative health website whose not-so-subtle innuendo has subsequently echoed through the darkest and most paranoid corners of the internet -- and which has begun to leak into mainstream media outlets as well."
350,350,631.IsLauraPhelpsaCrisis,"Claim:Laura Phelps is a crisis actor who lost children during school shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012 and Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018.Rating:FalseAbout this rating :In the aftermath of the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary shooting that left dozens of people dead, some local parents had their names dragged through a cesspool of conspiracy theories and they were falsely accused of being ""crisis actors."" That includes Nick and Laura Phelps, who are the parents of two children who attended the school in Newtown, Connecticut and survived the shooting.A new wrinkle was added to these rumors after another school shooting in February 2018. The devastation at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which left 17 dead, somehow inspired conspiracy theorists to claim that the Phelps had returned to the headlines as ""crisis actors,"" this time with a daughter who attended Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.:We first encountered this rumor in a 16 February 2018 Facebook post from Melissa Wean:This is the same twatwaffle who was yelling at president Trump to do something about guns in schools yesterday.My god the powers that be are becoming so fucking lazy these days.

On 14 March 2014, an article began circulating on the Internet positing that the U.S. Navy had diverted the missing airliner to a secret Navy base and captured it:A new report circulating in the Kremlin today prepared by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces (GRU) states that Aerospace Defence Forces (VKO) experts remain ""puzzled"" as to why the United States Navy ""captured and then diverted"" a Malaysia Airlines civilian aircraft from its intended flight-path to their vast and highly-secretive Indian Ocean base located on the Diego Garcia atoll.According to this report, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 (also marketed as China Southern Airlines flight 748 through a codeshare) was a scheduled passenger flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, China, when on 8 March this Boeing 777-200ER aircraft ""disappeared"" in flight with 227 passengers on board from 15 countries, most of whom were Chinese, and 12 crew members.Interesting to note, this report says, was that Flight 370 was already under GRU ""surveillance"" after it received a ""highly suspicious"" cargo load that had been traced to the Indian Ocean nation Republic of Seychelles, and where it had previously been aboard the US-flagged container ship MV Maersk Alabama.:This item was just more fictional ""Sorcha Faal"" sensationalism originating with a single disreputable source, the whatdoesitmean.com political conspiracy site, of which  RationalWiki says:Sorcha Faal is the alleged author of an ongoing series of ""reports"" published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don't think much of it. Each report resembles a news story in its style but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don't contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish.Last updated:   24 March 2014"
352,352,369.WereAustralianLawmak,"Claim:In spring 2022, officials in the Australian state of Victoria were considering legislation that would prohibit people from growing their own food. Rating:FalseAbout this rating Fact CheckIn April 2022, a lengthy piece of text claiming that officials in the Australian state of Victoria were pushing legislation that would ban people from growing food circulated on conspiratorial websites, which presented the alleged bill as a nefarious plot to starve Australian citizens. The headline of an article on XYZ.Net.au, for example, read: ""Psychopath Daniel Andrews (Premier of Victoria) Plans To STARVE Victorians."":On social media, the claim was boiled down to digestible memes and brief tweets, including the following:The claim was not true, however. This rumor centered on a genuine proposal by Victorian lawmakers called the Agriculture Legislation Amendment Bill 2022. That bill -- which had bipartisan support, as of this writing -- dealt with invasive species and other potential threats to Australia's agriculture industry. In a fact sheet about the bill, the state government explained its purpose and addressed the false claim that the legislation would prohibit Australians from growing their own food::This Bill aims to help safeguard food security, food safety and access to export markets which are vital for Victoria's economy.Claim: The State Government is passing a bill now which means you won't be allowed to grow your own food, they can forcibly come in and rip it all out. Facts:* The amendments will help safeguard food security, food safety and access to export markets. For example, by preventing contamination of food from pesticides.* The amendments will not result in the destruction of crops, nor will they prevent people growing their own food.* Information circulating online misinterprets and misrepresents amendments in the Agriculture Legislation Amendment Bill.Professor Paul Martin, director of the Australian Centre for Agriculture and Law, told AAP FactCheck:What the legislation does do is provide a way of dealing with potential biodiversity issues and invasive species problems that have emerged or could emerge. Some of these are serious, real threats, and laws are being tightened in response, to make existing controls easier to enforce."":Reuters spoke to a Victoria Government spokesperson, who also said of the bill: ""No one will be prevented from growing their own food as part of these changes."" The news agency continued:[The spokesperson] added that the bill was designed to support the agriculture sector, as well as safeguard food security, food safety and access to export markets.Professor Michael Blakeney, from the University of Western Australia's Institute of Agriculture (here), said he ""couldn't find anything"" within the bill that ""prevents people cultivating food crops on their own properties.""The claim that Australian lawmakers were considering the purported food-growing ban was shared in articles that also pushed other debunked conspiracy theories. The article on XYZ.Net.Au, for example, falsely claimed that there had been an unusual amount of fires at food processing plants this year and that the U.S. government was paying people to destroy crops.  :While the rumor about Australian legislation gained traction on social media, it reached a larger audience thanks to podcast host Joe Rogan. In an episode that aired in mid-May 2022, he talked about the claim like Australian officials really were pushing a policy package that would prohibit people from growing their own food. Then, another person on mic presumably looked up online whether any reputable news outlets had reported on the alleged initiative and came up empty. In other words, the conspiratorial podcast was once again spreading misinformation. :It's important to note that this claim was part of a baseless conspiracy theory that the government (either Australia's or the United States' or the ""New World Order"") was purposefully creating a food shortage in order to starve people so that a nefarious group of elites could enslave them. These conspiracy theories are often connected to white supremacist ideals as they pit ""regular"" Australian farmers attempting to grow their own food against ""others"" who are competing for the food supply. The XYZ article, for example, ended like this: ""We'll also need to defend our food supply, and a network of solid friends to help us. Time to tribe up, White man."""
353,353,468.DidVideoShowGosarWav,"Claim:Video shows Republican Rep. Paul Gosar waving at rioters from a Capitol window on Jan. 6, 2021.Rating:MiscaptionedAbout this rating Ever since the U.S. Capitol riot in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, 2021, online sleuths have looked for answers about a specific video of a man waving at protesters from one of the windows of the Capitol building. The man who was waving wore a dress shirt and tie, leading many to believe he might have been a Republican politician who was sympathetic to supporters of then-U.S. President Donald Trump. One of the most mentioned theories was that the video showed Rep. Paul Gosar, a Republican who had made the false claim that there was widespread voter fraud in the 2020 U.S. presidential election::Rep. GosarOne of the clips that was most scrutinized showed the man who was waving suddenly moving away from the Capitol window::Some Twitter users theorized that the video showed Gosar being yanked away from the window by fellow Republican Rep. Mo Brooks, who also had said he believed the debunked conspiracy theory that there was widespread voter fraud in the election:""This Jan. 6 video needs to be investigated,"" one popular tweet with thousands of engagements read.:Reps. Biggs and WeberOthers believed the video showed Reps. Andy Biggs or Randy Weber. Both men also said they believed in the false notion that there was massive and widespread election fraud:One of the tweets that theorized that the video showed Weber waving from the Capitol window received quite a bit of engagement::Finding the AnswerAfter more than a year of theorizing, the case was finally solved by Twitter user and ""sedition hunter"" @K2theSky.In a tweet, @K2theSky said it wasn't Gosar, Biggs, or Weber waving from the Capitol window, nor was it any other politician. Instead, it simply showed a journalist named Bob Agnew. On Jan. 6, Agnew was a U.S. Senate correspondent for Salem Radio Network news::According to videos on Agnew's own Facebook profile, this was true. One clip showed that his face, dress shirt, and tie all matched the other video.In the clips, he was simply following directions from law enforcement to stay put in a specific area of the building. According to all of the videos on his profile from that day, he spent time looking out of the Capitol window while narrating that he was waving at people who were waving and making ""menacing signs"" at him.:""There you see some supporters down there [for President Trump],"" Agnew said in one of the videos. ""Some of them are looking up to me. Some think I'm a bad guy. They think I'm a member of, I don't know, whatever part of the press they don't like. Some don't know who I am. Some are waving. Some are making menacing signs. But, here I am, basically trapped in the Senate radio and TV gallery.""The video even included a glimpse of the empty U.S. Senate floor::Agnew responded to our questions after this story was published. On Nov. 2, 2022, he told us on Messenger, ""I didn't fall but rather stepped down off the chair I was standing on to be that high by the window."" This cleared up why he appeared to disappear so quickly from being visible in the window.In sum, the man in the video who was waving from the Capitol window on Jan. 6 was Agnew, a journalist, and was not Gosar, Biggs, Weber, or another Republican politician, as previously theorized."
354,354,432.DidKrogerSupermarket,"Claim:In the summer of 2020, Kroger supermarkets introduced a policy of refusing to give customers cash change, as shown in an incident in Bourbonnais, Illinois.Rating:MixtureAbout this rating What's TrueA cashier at a Kroger supermarket in Bourbonnais, Illinois, appears to have insisted that a customer pay $3 for a $2.41 container of milk, without providing cash change. In at least two instances, the company and one of its spokespersons had by that time publicly stated that the company had a policy of no longer providing coin change to customers.What's FalseHowever, Kroger told Snopes that company policy is not to refuse to give out cash change. According to a company statement provided on July 22, cash change is still available at Kroger supermarkets as a matter of policy, but in light of an ongoing nationwide coin shortage, the company's policy is to offer customers the option of having the amount of their change added to their loyalty card, or to round up their payment and donate the remainder to charity.:In the summer of 2020, readers asked us to examine widely shared Facebook posts that claimed the Kroger supermarket chain was refusing to give customers cash change, and thereby overcharging them. One widely shared post from July 9 stated that:""Kroger will no longer keep coins in the drawer. Starting tomorrow. We will take them, but we can't give change. You can round up to the nearest dollar and donate it to the food bank, or round up and it goes onto your Kroger card as a credit. So it begins ..."":One week later, Facebook users began sharing a post that purported to describe a contentious transaction and conversation at a Kroger supermarket in Bourbonnais, Illinois. The post claimed that, in light of a coin shortage, Kroger was rounding up the price of items to the next dollar, where a customer pays in cash, and then refusing to give out change, thus effectively overcharging customers:... Stopped by Kroger today for just a gallon of milk.Seems due to this ""Change Shortage"", their new policy is to round every cash purchase UP to the next full dollar!I can even accept if they insisted on they could not ""give"" any coin back.It cost $2.41. I offered $2.50 payment.The clerk refused the quarters, explained ""due to change shortage"" policy & demanded another dollar instead.I offered the $2.50 again.Clerk: ""Your total is $3.00.""Me: The total is $2.41, which $2.50 adequately covers & I don't care to give up the 9 cent, but I do NOT accept being up charged 60 cent while you refuse to take the coins I am offering.Clerk: it's $3.00So literally the clerk was insisting I pay the $3 or they were refusing the sale. WTF ?!?...:A nationwide coin shortage did take place in the summer of 2020, contrary to a prevalent conspiracy theory that falsely claimed the crisis was fabricated or manufactured in order to usher in a cashless economy as part of a broader push towards a ""New World Order."" That conspiracy theory reared its head in the Kroger post, which included the line, ""This is how being FORCED into a Cashless economy begins!"":Remarkably, it is not clear what Kroger's company policy was with regard to providing cash change to customers, at the time the Bourbonnais Facebook post was originally published, in the early hours of July 16. Initially, a spokesperson for the company provided Snopes a statement which asserted that, in light of the ongoing nationwide coin shortage, Kroger was offering customers the option of receiving the amount of their change in the form of loyalty card credit or rounding up their total and donating the remainder to charity, as well as the existing options of paying by credit or debit card, or paying by cash and getting cash change. The statement read:""We remain committed to providing our customers with an uplifting shopping experience and the freedom and flexibility to choose their payment method, including cash, during this unprecedented time. The Federal Reserve is experiencing a significant coin shortage across the U.S., resulting from fewer coins being exchanged and spent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Like many retailers and businesses, we are adjusting to the temporary shortage in several ways while still accepting cash.:""Customers can switch their payment type (e.g., use debit or credit vs. cash), and through our upgraded technology, we can now load coin change to their loyalty card for use during the next shopping trip, provide coin change at a lane with coins available or round up their order to support The Kroger Co. Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation, a public charity committed to creating communities free of hunger and waste."" [Emphasis is added.]However, after this fact check was first published, we became aware of contradictory public statements attributed to Kroger earlier in July. In a July 15 article, KABC-TV reported that Kroger had ""announced this week that they will not be returning coin change to customers who pay with cash."" The article attributed the following statement to the company:""Currently our stores are collecting donations... by allowing customers to round up their order total to the next dollar... For customers that choose not to donate, our cashiers will load the coin value due back through their loyalty card. Customers can redeem the amount on their next transaction. We know this is an inconvenience for our customers and we appreciate their patience."":That statement made no mention of the continued possibility of customers receiving their coin change as coin change, an omission which naturally indicates that Kroger policy at that time was to not provide customers with coin change. On July 10, a named company spokesperson appears to have told another news outlet that Kroger policy was to no longer give out coin change. WXIX reported that: ""Kroger spokesperson Erin Rofles confirmed Friday the grocer will no longer return coin change to customers. Instead, the remainders from cash transactions will be applied to customers' loyalty cards and automatically used on their next purchase.""We asked Kroger to explain these glaring discrepancies in the company's various public articulations of its policy on coin change. A spokesperson said that the statement initially provided to Snopes (which asserted that company policy was to give customers the option of receiving coin change) was ""first issued on July 13,"" suggesting the company had been consistent in its messaging on the subject. We found the same wording in a series of tweets the company sent to a customer on July 14. Nevertheless, the company also told KABC-TV the opposite in an article published the following day. :In one particularly egregious example of the confusion surrounding Kroger's articulation of its policy, on July 14 the company actually posted two different sets of tweets in response to the same customer's inquiries on Twitter. In one pair of tweets, Kroger told @bbaum17 that customers could either have their change loaded on to their loyalty card or donated to charity (no mention of coin change). In a second pair of tweets, Kroger told @bbaum17 that the company could accept a credit or debit card as payment, or load the customer's change on to their loyalty card, or have it donated to charity, or they could ""provide coin change at a lane with coins available."" The company spokesperson suggested to Snopes that news articles reporting that Kroger was no longer giving out coin change might have been based on signs that have been erected inside Kroger supermarkets. The spokesperson provided the following example, which reads:ATTENTION CUSTOMERS:The Federal Reserve is currently experiencing a coin shortage.Please consider Rounding Up for Zero Hunger ZeroWaste, using exact change or another form of payment.We apologize for any inconvenience this maycause and appreciate your help.::A sign that apologizes to customers for the inconvenience associated with an ongoing nationwide coin shortage, suggests three ways to avoid the need to provide change, and omits to mention that customers can still get their change in coin form is very obviously likely to create the perception that Kroger no longer gives out coin change. We asked Kroger for exact details on whether, when and how its policy on coin change had changed; as well as whether, when, and how those changes had been communicated to Kroger's regional divisions, in-store employees, and paying customers. We will update this fact check if we receive a response to those questions. In its initial statement to Snopes, Kroger gave us the clear impression that its policy on coin change was unambiguous, made no mention of any existing confusion or misinformation over that policy, and made no mention whatsoever that the company and its spokespersons had previously made directly contradictory public statements about that policy. :In reality, Kroger and its spokespersons had indeed issued contradictory and confusing public statements, and had done so before the original ""Bourbonnais"" Facebook post was published in the early hours of July 16. As a result, we are changing the rating in this fact check from ""Mostly False"" to ""Mixture.""BourbonnaisIt's not entirely clear what took place at the Kroger supermarket in Bourbonnais, Illinois, specifically, but it appears to have been at least similar to the description in the widely shared Facebook post. A spokesperson for the company told Snopes: ""The associate who engaged with this customer was newly trained to the cashier role and misunderstood the various ways we're adapting to the temporary national coin shortage. It is an isolated event, and we've since coached the associate and contacted the customer.""This appears to be a tacit admission by the company that, in the specific instance highlighted in the Facebook post, the cashier did incorrectly insist on receiving $3 in cash for the milk, but that this was not in keeping with the company's policy, although as we outlined above, the company's public articulation of its policy on coin change has not been consistent.:The image of a receipt that accompanied the viral Facebook post was dated July 15, and indicates that the customer in question paid $3 in cash for a $2.41 container of milk (after tax). A line in the receipt labelled ""change shortage"" had $0.59 next to it, and the ""change"" line had 0.00 next to it. That indicates that the customer did not receive cash change. Shortly after midnight on July 16, a person who lives near Bourbonnais, whose name we are withholding because their original Facebook post was private, published what appears to be the original version of the subsequently widely shared post. (That original version of the post began ""Stopped by Kroger today"" while versions published later began ""Stopped by Kroger yesterday,"" and the edit history of the post shows that a photograph of the receipt that showed the name of the cashier was replaced with a photograph showing the cashier's name obscured -- both signs that the post was published by the customer in question). We contacted that person, whose identity we verified. In an email to Snopes, that person reiterated the version of events presented in the original Facebook post. The customer clarified that it was not possible to purchase the milk with a debit or credit card because the patron lives on ""a cash basis."":To complicate matters further, on July 22 a Facebook page with the name ""KROGER-Bourbonnais"" published responses to the viral post, explaining that the company was ""currently allocating the remaining change that you would typically receive after your purchase to your Kroger Loyalty Card,"" but later wrote that ""we are not rounding up ... it was just a mistake of [sic] a cashier.""Those posts were not written by an authentic Kroger company account, a spokesperson told Snopes, adding ""Our social media team isn't affiliated with it."""
355,355,558.Snopesing101Spotting,"A picture, as the saying goes, is worth a thousand words. But if a picture contains a misleading caption or is presented out of context, it may take a thousand words to clean up the misinformation mess.Sometimes the problem can be unintentional -- like a missing-person post still circulating online well after the person has been found. Sometimes captions can be removed and purposely replaced with inaccurate descriptions as part of war propaganda. Bottom line: A common way misinformation spreads online is when older images are repurposed for whatever reason with new, misleading captions. When sharing social media posts that contain images, it's a good idea to make sure the context is accurate. So how do you spot a photograph that is circulating online out of context or with a misleading caption?The first go-to, of course, is to see if the image has been covered by Snopes or other reputable fact-checking outlets, and if it hasn't, you can submit a tip.:But if you're in the mood to do some research on your own, a good place to start is to do a reverse-image search. As we previously noted, a number of search engines offer this service, namely Google Images, TinEye, Yandex, and Bing Images. To do this, download the image in question, and upload it into the search engine. (If an image has its own url, some search engines like Google allow you to paste the url instead of downloading it.)The search engine will give you a list of places where the image has appeared before. Take a look and see when the image first appeared online. Was it before the alleged event the social media post in question claims? Can the photograph be found on the website for a reputable news outlet? If so, what does the news outlet's caption say? News captions are often written by the photographers who took the original photographs.Also as we previous reported, when you do a reverse-image search, you may notice that an image's caption changes over time. The viral version is often not the accurate one, but is instead the most emotionally engaging one. The goal of doing a reverse search is to try to track down the image's original source.:In some instances, the subject of a picture will make a clarification after the image has already gone viral -- and that clarification inevitably gets far less attention than the initial viral sensation. Most people don't follow up to find out whether an image that went viral was shared accurately. It often takes at least a day or two for the bigger picture to become clear. In the meantime, caution is often the best option. Waiting for all of the facts to come out is often better (and less potentially embarrassing) than sharing a viral image in the heat of the moment that later turns out to be misleading.For example, you may have seen images online of hotel heiress Paris Hilton wearing a shirt that said, ""Stop being poor."" But did you know that Hilton pointed out the message on the shirt didn't say that? Before it was digitally altered for the sake of memes, the shirt she wore  really said, ""Stop being desperate.""In another example, some pointed to screenshots from an episode of ""Jeopardy"" that convinced them contestant Kelly Donohue was flashing the three-fingered ""white power"" sign on their television screens, creating an internet uproar. But a closer examination of context showed that in previous episodes, Donohue had held one and then two fingers up to signify his wins, and was simply counting his victories by holding up the corresponding number of fingers -- in that instance, his third win with three fingers.Here are just a few more examples of viral posts containing images with misleading captions/context that went viral.:No, Allisyn Nicole Is Not Still Missing.In 2018, posts circulated on social media, many showing a smiling girl seated at a keyboard, and containing a message that the girl, Allisyn Nicole, had been missing ""since yesterday at 11:30 a.m."" The post was relentlessly shared online for years, doubtlessly by many well-meaning people who believed she was missing ""since yesterday.""Although we couldn't independently verify the authenticity of the original post, it's outdated regardless and has been for a long time. A woman identifying herself as Nicole's mother posted an update stating that the girl had been found. In this example, an alleged missing-person post, stripped of the context of its original post date, led many to falsely believe the girl pictured was still missing. No, Wayfair Wasn't Selling a Wardrobe Named for a Missing ChildA similar piece of misinformation circulated in 2021 -- similar in that the misinformation was based on an outdated report of a missing child. The viral post contained an image of an alleged Wayfair ""Doswell Door Wardrobe"" (the existence of which we weren't able to confirm) side-by-side with a missing person bulletin for a child with the surname Doswell. But police informed us that the child was found and was no longer missing.:The post played into a viral 2020 election year conspiracy theory that posited the furniture retailer was participating in child trafficking by selling large, high-priced items named for the children they were said to be shipping inside the items.No, a Video Doesn't Show the Skeleton of a Giant, Extinct SnakeIn March 2022, a viral TikTok video claimed that Google Maps captured a satellite image of a giant snake skeleton belonging to Titanoboa, an extinct giant snake. But the picture was mis-captioned.Titanoboa snakes were massive. They grew to an average of 42.7 feet long and weighed around 1.25 tons, per the Encyclopedia Britannica. They lived about 58 million to 60 million years ago. The Titanoboa was discovered in a Colombian coal mine and first described in 2009.Although the skeleton featured in the TikTok video is massive, it's not real -- it's an art installment. The metal sculpture is known as Le Serpent d'Ocean, and is located in Saint-Brevin-les-Pins on the west coast of France.:Image doesn't show Miss Ukraine Taking Up Arms Against RussiaWhen Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. 2022, local time, the Ukrainian people took up arms to defend their homeland. An image that appeared to show Anastasiia Lenna, who won Miss Grand Ukraine in 2015, holding a rifle went viral, as people saw it as a show of strength coming even from the country's beauty queens.But the image doesn't show Lenna holding an actual rifle, it's an airsoft gun. She posted the image on her Instagram account on Feb. 22, 2022, two days before the Russian invasion, along with the hashtags, #standwithukraine and #handsoffukraine. As the image continued to circulate after Russia invaded, it led many to assume Lenna had joined Ukraine's military forces.Lenna later posted a message clarifying she had not joined the military but had simply posted the image and hashtags to show support for her country."
356,356,436.IsVolkswagens300MPGC,"Claim:   The federal government is preventing Volkswagen's XL1 model car from being sold in the U.S. because the vehicle is too fuel-efficient.FALSEExamples:   [Collected via e-mail, September 2013]Volkswagen's New 300 MPG Car Not Allowed In America Because It Is Too EfficientWould like to know of the article is valid.   Origins:   For many years conspiracy rumors have circulated positing that a collusion between Big Oil and the U.S. government has prevented the American public from having the opportunity to purchase fully developed, market-ready automobiles capable of obtaining fuel efficiencies of 200-300 MPG.  Such rumors have taken the form of everything from mysterious forces stealing cars equipped with miracle carburetors to keep that technology's existence a secret, to the federal government's enacting regulations intended for the sole purpose of keeping high-mileage vehicles out of the U.S. market in order to protect the interests (and profits) of American oil companies.:April 2014 saw the emergence of yet another entry in this vein, courtesy of Jim Stone, Freelance Journalist (the same ""journalist"" who promulgated the ridiculous story about a passenger on missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 who supposedly hid his cell phone in his rectum and used it to post a picture to the Internet after the flight was hijacked), positing that Volkswagen has a terrific 300 MPG vehicle that only costs $60,000 all ready to go, but it can't be sold (or even seen) in America because politicians in the pay of oil companies are conspiring to keep it unknown and unsellable in the U.S.:You won't find the 300 MPG Volkswagen XL1 in an American showroom, in fact it has even been denied a tour of America because it is too efficient for the American public to be made widely aware of, and oil profits are too high in America with the status quo in place. No tour has been allowed for this car because the myth that 50 mpg is virtually impossible to obtain from even a stripped down econobox is too profitable to let go of, and when it comes to corporate oil profits, ignorance is bliss.The answer is obvious. Simply for the sake of raking in huge profits from $4 a gallon gas, getting guzzled at 10X the rate it should be, the corporations have via campaign contributions and other types of pay outs succeeded in getting the FED to legislate the best cars off the road for irrelevant trumped up reasons. Even after being hand made with ""exotic"" materials in an intentionally limited edition, the Xl1 still only costs $60,000. There is a lot more of a market for this car than 2,000 units at that price, have no doubt, this car is being held back on purpose.:In this case the vehicle in question is the Volkswagen XL1, a two-person,  ""one-liter"" concept car (i.e., a vehicle capable of averaging 100 km per liter of fuel, or about 235 MPG) originally shown to the public back in 2002 and modified (and renamed) several times since over the intervening years.  The latest unveiled version of the XL1, already put into production, is a plug-in diesel-electric hybrid described thusly by Green Car Reports:The Volkswagen XL1 is a plug-in diesel hybrid with a body seemingly beamed in from a future time.It's the physical representation of the benefits of reducing weight and improving aerodynamics. The small body may only take two people, but it's allowed for an incredibly streamlined body with a drag coefficient of only 0.189.Low weight -- only 1,752 lbs -- means only a small engine and electric motor is needed to deliver respectable performance. Much of the car is constructed from carbon fiber, aluminum and titanium.VW says the car will do 261 mpg, though the real figure will be lower than that should it ever be tested under EPA guidelines. Even so, it'll still use comfortably less fuel than any vehicle currently on sale.A diesel engine of only 0.8 liters and 2 cylinders capacity produces 47 horsepower, with a further 27 horses delivered by the electric motor. Power reaches the wheels via a 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox.Those figures sound miniscule by modern standards, but the XL1 should reach 62 mph in 12.7 seconds. Top speed is 98 mph.Operating alone, the small battery can deliver up to 31 miles of range, and can be charged via plug or regenerative effect.:It's true that very few, if any, Volkswagen XL1s will likely be seen on U.S. roads in the immediate future, but that situation will be due to a confluence of factors that does not include a government/Big Oil conspiracy to keep them out of the U.S.First of all, it's not true that the XL1 has ""been denied a tour of America because it is too efficient for the American public to be made widely aware of.""  Existing safety and traffic regulations do limit where the current XL1 models can be legally driven in public roads in the U.S., but Volkswagen has taken at least three of the vehicles on tour around the U.S., and the staff of Jalopnik drove one around Manhattan at the end of 2013.Second, the primary reason the XL1 won't be seen in the U.S. anytime soon is that Volkswagen is only producing 200 units for retail sale (not 2,000 as claimed above), all of them to be sold in Europe via some sort of selection (i.e., lottery) process.    :But why only 200 cars?  And why only in Europe?As for the first part, the answer is that new vehicles like the XL1 are expensive to develop and produce (and therefore expensive for consumers to afford), and similar forms of automobiles have not yet met with tremendous success on the commercial market, so any automotive company that puts such a model into full-blown production risks sinking a whole lot of money into something that may not sell well at all (especially in the U.S. market, where consumers have very different expectations and preferences than European car buyers do). The XL1 is in many ways still a concept/prototype vehicle, and so Volkswagen is testing the waters by putting out a limited production run to see how many consumers are really interested in shelling out the equivalent of U.S. $150,000 (not $60,000 as claimed above) for a two-person car.  And the testers at Car and Driver found that while the XL1's fuel efficiency might be superb, it might also be somewhat overblown as presented in promotional materials:The XL1 should run 31 miles solely on electric power, says [VW development engineer Ulrich] Mitze. But on the cold and rainy April day we drove it, the small, 60-cell, 5.5-kWh, 150-pound lithium-ion battery pack needed a recharge after only 22 miles. According to the on-board computer, we are fuel hogs. Having started with a full tank (2.6 gallons) and fully charged batteries, we ended our trip after 67 miles; fuel consumption plummeted at one point to a dismal 128 mpg. Achieving the XL1's theoretical 749-mile range would take a right foot as light as a moonbeam.:As for why only Europe, the answer is that the U.S. does have many safety standards in place (enacted many years ago a variety of reasons, none of which was to keep high-mileage vehicles off the U.S. market) that all automobile manufacturers have to meet in order to legally sell their vehicles in America, regulations that sometimes require manufacturers to modify or retrofit models that were produced for sale under less strict regulations in Europe (or other parts of the world).  If Volkswagen wants to test-market their XL1 in limited quantities, there's no reason for them to expend millions of dollars preparing and certifying those vehicles for U.S. safety standards when they can vend  their small lot of cars just as well in the European market without all the added expense.  As noted by USA Today:The XL1 [is] a spaceship-like, ultra-high-mpg, plug-in diesel-electric hybrid. VW used exotic, but obtainable, materials and technologies to craft a mileage-above-all car able to get 261 mpg in European tests, equating, very roughly, to perhaps 200 mpg in U.S. tests.Barely a real production model, it's made in a factory, but largely by hand. It couldn't meet U.S. safety rules and needed changes in German rules to be on the road there.:And if one buys into the conspiracy theory that the government and Big Oil are colluding to keep high-mileage vehicles off the U.S. market in order to protect profits from gasoline sales, one has to wonder why those powerful and malevolent entities aren't doing anything to stop Americans from purchasing cars produced by Tesla, superbly-performing vehicles that use no gasoline at all yet still deliver premium performance, have great range for electric cars, have received the highest rating of any automobile ever evaluated by Consumer Reports, are top-rated for safety even under tougher U.S. standards, but are widely available for purchase in the U.S.:Most Americans may never actually see a Tesla Model S sedan in person, but you will want to know why this car is so important to the automotive industry and what all the media fuss is about.Tesla Motors was founded in 2003 by a group of intrepid Silicon Valley engineers who set out to prove that electric vehicles could be awesome. The name of the company pays homage to Nicola Tesla, a Serbian American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, physicist, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.As the California automaker's first production model, the Tesla Model S is 100 percent electric, a car so advanced it sets the new standard for premium performance. This is not a hybrid, nor is it equipped with any kind of ""range expanding"" gasoline engine. At the heart of the vehicle is the proven Tesla powertrain, delivering both unprecedented range and a thrilling drive experience. The Tesla Model S has won the 2013 Motor Trend Car of the Year award, received the highest rating of any automobile in history from Consumer Reports (99 out of 100) and achieved the best possible US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration rating.Unlike the internal combustion engine with hundreds of moving pieces that spark, pump, belch, and groan, the Tesla motor has only one moving piece: the rotor. As a result, Model S acceleration is instantaneous, like flipping a switch. Hit the accelerator. In 5.4 seconds, Model S is traveling 60 miles per hour, without hesitation and without a drop of gasoline.:As in so many cases, what is attributed to furtive conspiracy is more easily explained away as wishful thinking colliding with the hard, cold realities of economics.Last updated:   14 April 2014Sources:     Ballaban, Michael.

357,357,301.DidMuslimGroupsRaise,"Claim:American Muslim groups raised more than $190,000 to benefit victims of the mass shooting attack at a Pittsburgh synagogue.Rating:TrueAbout this rating In the wake of an October 2018 mass shooting attack at a Pittsburgh synagogue that left eleven worshipers dead, both news and social media platforms picked up on a show of solidarity extended to the survivors on the part of two Muslim groups.On 30 October 2018, the liberal Facebook group The Other 98% shared a photograph of two men hanging a Star of David for Irving Younger, one of the victims of the attack at the Tree of Life Synagogue three days earlier, along with the caption ""Muslim Americans raise more than $190,000 for those affected by Pittsburgh synagogue shooting. This is what makes America great""::In this case, the meme was correct: As of 1 November 2018, the Muslims Unite for Pittsburgh Synagogue fundraising campaign had raised over $227,000, dwarfing their initial fundraising goal of $25,000. :The campaign was organized by two Muslim community groups, MPowerChange and CelebrateMercy, as described on the fundraiser's web site:In a campaign organized by CelebrateMercy and MPower Change, the Muslim-American community extends its hands to help the shooting victims, whether it is the injured victims or the Jewish families who have lost loved ones.We wish to respond to evil with good, as our faith instructs us, and send a powerful message of compassion through action. Our Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, said: ""Show mercy to those on earth, and the One in the Heavens will show mercy to you."" The Quran also teaches us to ""Repel evil by that which is better.""On 30 October 2018, the groups updated the fundraiser to note that they had transferred $25,000 to the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh, which had met with officials ""to begin planning fund disbursement to the victims' families.""  On 1 November, they reported another $110,000 had been disbursed.Eleven people were killed in the shooting. The suspect, a 46-year-old Pennsylvania man, had a history of spewing anti-Semitic rhetoric online, including promoting the conspiracy theory that Jewish people were helping immigrants from Central America, whom he called ""invaders,"" make their way to the United States. The day of the shooting, he posted on the right-wing social media site Gab to say that he ""can't sit by and watch [his] people get slaughtered,"" adding, ""Screw your optics, I'm going in."":On 31 October 2018, the suspect was charged with 11 federal hate crimes, including murder, for the fatal assault."
358,358,278.DidBarackObamaMockPr,"Claim:Barack Obama poked fun at President Trump on Twitter for saying that grocery shoppers required ID,Rating:FalseAbout this rating Fans of former president Barack Obama -- or at least critics who like seeing current President Donald Trump get roasted online -- might have gotten their hopes up at what appeared to be a Twitter jab aimed at Trump by his predecessor. But the truth is, the tweet was manufactured.:On 1 August 2018, an image began circulating online designed to look like it issued from Obama's Twitter account, with wording that read, ""What type of ID do we need to buy groceries I'm at the store and all I have on me is my birth certificate""::Actually, Barack Obama only posted two tweets that day -- one of them listed the Democratic Party candidates he was endorsing in the 2018 midterm elections, and the other promoted those candidates:I'm confident that, together, they'll strengthen this country we love by restoring opportunity, repairing our alliances and standing in the world, and upholding our fundamental commitment to justice, fairness, responsibility, and the rule of law. But first, they need our votes.The fake tweet contained two barbs aimed at the current president. It made light of Trump's already widely-derided argument for voter identification cards offered during a 31 July 2018 speech, when the President said, ""If you go out and you want to buy groceries, you need a picture on a card, you need ID. You go out, you want to buy anything, you need ID, you need your picture."":In reality, shoppers only need to produce identification when purchasing age-restricted items such as cigarettes or alcohol, or picking up prescriptions from grocery stores that include pharmacies. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said a day later that Trump was referring to alcohol purchases when he made the remark.The ""birth certificate"" reference in the fake Obama tweet was also a callback to Trump's longtime promotion of the ""birther"" conspiracy theory, which claimed that Obama was not born in the U.S. and consequently ineligible to be president. In 2011, Trump claimed credit for the fact that Obama released his long-form birth certificate. But unidentified advisers reportedly said in 2017 that even after being elected president, Trump ""used closed-door conversations to question the authenticity"" of his predecessor's birth certificate."

[Editor's note: This article refers to the months of June-August as ""summer,"" even though in Australia itself, they comprise the winter.]As Australia endured a spike in COVID-19 infections late summer of 2021, another trend had become apparent -- a rise in the spread of online disinformation and conspiracy theory content emerging from the country, and seized upon by COVID-19 skeptics and vaccine opponents thousands of miles away, primarily in the U.S. and U.K. In August, a make-up artist in the city of Melbourne posted a video clip recorded at a police station, which was falsely presented to millions around the world as proof of Australia's rapid descent into brutal COVID-era authoritarianism. Her apparent journey ""down the rabbithole"" of online conspiracy theories, and the way in which the video spread throughout the world in a matter of hours, could be a warning of what's to come, as Australia's federal and state officials push to maximize vaccine uptake, and ensure compliance with yet more restrictions, with many Australians already experiencing lockdown fatigue.:Changing Fortunes Empty benches with the Opera House in the background on August 23, 2021 in Sydney, Australia. (Photo by James D. Morgan/Getty Images)Throughout 2020, Australia seemed -- to the outside world at least -- immune from the very worst ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Border closures and strict lockdowns kept infections and fatalities low, to the extent that by December, the city of Melbourne, with a population of just over 5 million -- around the same as the state of South Carolina -- saw no new cases for a month.:In November, the world-famous Sydney Opera House reopened its doors, and in the whole of 2020, the virus claimed 909 lives in a population of 26 million -- just one death for every 28,000 people -- as opposed to nearly 372,000 in the United States -- a death for every 891 people.However, 2021 brought changing fortunes to Australia. The emergence of the delta variant caused several spikes in infections across various states, and significant outbreaks in New South Wales and Victoria -- home to the country's two major population centers, Sydney and Melbourne, respectively.The summer of 2021 saw stringent new lockdowns, stay-at-home orders and curfews in and around those two cities, along with anti-lockdown protests, increasing social tensions, and a slow distribution of vaccines. Australia's COVID-19 strategy, widely acclaimed as a model of common sense and scientific rigor, appeared on the brink of unravelling, and the rest of the world stood up and took notice -- including anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown activists and conspiracy theorists, keen to latch on to any stray fragments of evidence that would undermine their own governments' travel restrictions and vaccine rollouts. :A spike in online misinformation has followed.In August, for example, the New South Wales (NSW) government announced plans for a vaccination drive targeting 16- to 18-year-old high school students in several neighborhoods, in and around Sydney, which had the most worrying recent COVID-19 infection data. The Qudos Arena (also known as the Super Dome) would be opened up and 24,000 students invited and encouraged to get their first dose of the Pfizer vaccine over the week of Aug. 9-14. Conspiracy theorists in the U.S. and the U.K. jumped into action, falsely claiming officials in NSW were planning to kidnap thousands of children and forcibly inject them en masse in the stadium::""Anecdotally, we have seen and heard from our networks of an increase in Covid-related misinformation since the beginning of the NSW outbreak,"" said Chris Cooper, executive director of Reset Australia, a group that advocates for enhanced regulation of online threats to democracy. Michael Jensen, associate professor at the University of Canberra's Institute for Governance and Policy Analysis, said his anecdotal observation was also that such misinformation ""has surged again with the emergence of the delta variant,"" and was now being primarily driven by the increased emphasis on vaccination. He added:Vaccine misinformation is a defense mechanism for those who wish to not get vaccinated. Some people likely never outgrow their anxieties about vaccinations. This makes the issue more problematic than the general factors that incline people to believe conspiracies.Peter Bodkin, FactCheck editor at the Australian Associated Press, told Snopes he had observed a ""significant increase in Covid-related [misinformation], particularly relating to vaccines, following outbreaks of the Delta variant."" He pointed to one especially glaring example of how misleading content can be wrested from its original context, on the ground in Australia, and then distorted and embellished in the hands of unscrupulous actors outside the country.:When pictures and short video clips emerged earlier in the summer of young people fainting in Australian vaccination centers -- a common and well-known minor side effect of any vaccination -- American conspiracy theorist Stew Peters falsely claimed the images were proof that three students had died as a result of the vaccination drive. As Bodkin said:That started out with people sharing unverified videos in Australia of people passed out, supposedly in vaccination centres; next it made its way to US conspiracy shows, by which time the claim was that the students had died, and then that misinformation about deaths started being picked up on social media in Australia as fact and fed back through the misinformation ecosystem here.Later in August, yet another fragment of evidence emerged online, and its rapid promulgation throughout the world illustrated a now familiar pattern: a video recorded ""on the ground"" in Australia, wrenched from its original context and shared by a local woman left frustrated and radicalized by the pandemic, and then seized upon by unscrupulous actors thousands of miles away. :The Werribee IncidentBeginning on Aug. 19, a 58-second video clip was viewed millions of times on Twitter alone and presented as evidence that authorities in Australia were brutally separating children from their parents, in order to forcibly vaccinate them against COVID-19, or to place them in quarantine after testing positive for the virus. ""Australian gestapo kidnaps daughter from her father's arms to forcibly inject her with an experimental drug,"" read one widely shared tweet.:""Reports [that] children testing positive for Covid are now being separated from their parents,"" read another. The next day, the retired England cricket captain Kevin Pietersen promoted the video to his 3.7 million Twitter followers, adding, ""This is absolutely disgusting!""In reality, of course, the incident shown in the video had nothing whatsoever to do with COVID-19 restrictions. On Twitter, police in the state of Victoria directly addressed Pietersen's exclamations, explaining ""This is inaccurate,"" and insisting that the clip ""was in no way related to Covid/vaccinations or testing."" A police spokesperson later told Snopes the incident took place on Aug. 14, at a police station in Werribee, a suburb of Melbourne. The separation of the man and child was no more or less than a ""family incident,"" the spokesperson added.(Snopes contacted representatives for Pietersen, asking for his response to Victoria Police's refutation of the conspiracy theory around the video, but we did not receive a reply of any kind. As of Sept. 1, Pietersen's tweet remained online). The earliest posts containing the footage that we could find were published on Aug. 19 by Hava Buday -- a 30-year-old beauty therapist and entrepreneur who lives in Melbourne. On TikTok, Instagram and Facebook, she shared the minute-long clip, along with the hashtag #lockdown -- a clear signal to viewers that the scene playing out before them was undoubtedly connected to the COVID-19 pandemic. :In an introduction to the footage, Buday tells the camera:I watched a video today where a child was ripped off his father. Then the father got assaulted. They were separating them ... Do you know how you have traumatized that child now, Australian government?... This is where compliance will lead us... So if you want to keep seeing more of this shit, you keep complying with every mandate they fucking tell you to. :Snopes sent several questions to Buday about the original source of the Werribee video, her response to Victoria Police's explanation of the incident, and her own emergence as an anti-lockdown online activist and commentator. We did not receive any response, despite repeated attempts to contact her. #TruthSeekerIn her public social media profiles, at least, Buday presents an interesting case study in how the COVID-19 pandemic has served to radicalize people who, by all appearances, seemed to have little interest in politics previously. For the past eight years, her Instagram profile contained no hint of politics, apart from a few Black Lives Matter-themed photos in June 2020, and no inkling of any belief in conspiracy theories. It suggested a well-adjusted and sociable woman with an interest in travel, fashion, animals and Turkish culture.Even during the lockdowns and stresses of 2020, she posted selfies from various beauty spots, along with videos containing homemade recipes for iced coffee, Turkish rice, and sucuk and eggs -- a traditional Turkish breakfast dish. :In the summer of 2021, amid a fresh wave of lockdowns, that appeared to have changed. In June, Buday posted videos that hinted at a shift in focus, advising followers about the health benefits of dandelions and nettles, and warning that ""the water we drink that contains fluoride actually has no minerals for our body.""In July, she posted a seven-minute informal lecture on ""systematic conditioning and differences between conspiracy theorists and truth seekers,"" using hashtags like #theawakening and #truthseeker -- known QAnon and conspiracy theorist signifiers. By August, her anger and frustration were on full display, and her adoption of the language of conspiracy theories and New Age spirituality appeared complete. In a video posted to Instagram on Aug. 16, she began, ""Listen here, Australian government, I'm fucking sick of your shit,"" and went on to accuse the government of conservative Liberal Party Prime Minister Scott Morrison of ""killing people with injections."" A week later, she smiled into the camera while pronouncing: ""All these low-vibrational people -- the ones that are in deep slumber, constantly trying to shut down the neurodivergence and my beautiful woke souls -- they're not coming to the new world."":""You can't even go outside and scream 'Fuck!'"" she complained, in another video on Aug. 16.:Three days later, she posted footage of the Werribee police station incident, along with the hashtag #savethekids -- yet another nod to QAnon and conspiracy theorist terminology. The kind of frustration and cabin fever expressed by Buday in her more recent videos is hardly unique, especially in Australia, whose national COVID-19 policy was built on the successful use of relatively strict lockdowns and restrictions, back in 2020. Now, the prospect of yet more lockdowns, among a population that could have been forgiven for thinking they had nearly defeated the virus for good, could provide fertile ground for the spread of non-compliance, conspiracy theories, and vaccine hesitancy.Cooper, from Reset Australia, told Snopes he thought the new wave of restrictions in 2021 was playing a role in the rise of misinformation::The prolonged lockdowns are obviously causing many Australians hardship, stress and frustration. And we know that these lockdowns create the perfect environmental factors that pull people down rabbit holes.We're all online more, we're worried and looking for answers, and we're all trying to find engaging content to alleviate a bit of the boredom. Facebook algorithms are designed to pull us in and keep us online -- but they don't discriminate on what they're engaging us with. If we want to stop the spread of misinformation online we actually need transparency about how these algorithms are operating and how we can moderate or disrupt their rabbit hole tendencies.However, several of the experts with whom we spoke pointed to at least one significant point of encouragement: whatever disinformation they might encounter online, Australians can expect virtual consensus from political leaders -- with a few notable exceptions -- about the importance of vaccination and lockdowns, especially by comparison with other countries -- the U.S., in particular.""Every major political party is pro-vaccination,"" said Tauel Harper, a media and communication lecturer at the University of Western Australia. He added::Anti-lockdown rhetoric is engaged in sparingly by our conservative party - the Liberal National Party (LNP), which holds power federally and also in the state of NSW. Generally, though, the lockdowns have been held to be very effective at limiting the spread of COVID and most states are relatively untouched by COVID as a result, so speaking against lockdowns is politically problematic. Public health officials, especially in the major population centers of NSW and Victoria, will no doubt be hoping that that consensus on vaccination holds strong in the face of weaponized disinformation and a potentially increased proliferation of online ""rabbit holes"" in locked-down homes across Australia.

360,360,287.SwedenBansChristmasL,"Claim:Sweden has discontinued the tradition of adorning street poles with Christmas lights to avoid angering Muslim refugees.Rating:FalseAbout this rating A news item posted by the Swedish news service SVT on 23 October 2016 reported that Trafikverket, the Swedish Transport Administration, will no longer allow local municipalities to hang Christmas lights on the street poles under its control, citing two reasons: first, the law doesn't authorize the agency to share its electricity, and second, the poles aren't designed to bear extra weight, so Christmas decorations are a safety hazard.:This wasn't happy news for small towns like Hestra, in western Sweden, where residents have adorned the main street with poinsettias every Christmas for the past 20 years, SVP reported. They asked for and received a two-year exemption on the ruling, which means they'll be able to decorate as usual this Christmas and next, but what happens after that is a question mark. Several municipalities have vowed to fight the decision.Though there wasn't a single mention of religion, immigrants, or refugees in the original report, various unreliable web sites quickly recast it as a ""War on Christmas"" story. For example, the conspiracy theory site InfoWars presented the Christmas light policy as a ""capitulation to Islam"":Towns across Sweden have banned Christmas street lights in the name of ""security,"" but the real reason is almost certainly because the country has completely capitulated to Islam after importing countless Muslim migrants over the last two years.Breitbart contributor Milo Yiannopoulos posted an article questioning the Swedish Transport Administration's justification of the policy::So what changed? The weight of these holiday lights? The durability of street poles? Or maybe it was the massive influx of Muslim migrants that dramatically altered the demographic landscape of Sweden over the past two years...Indeed, it seems the only real ""security"" concern is offending Muslim migrants -- the same ones responsible for destroying local businesses.The Morning News USA web site took the cake for hyperbole, headlining its article, ""Sweden No Longer Celebrating Christmas: Bans Holiday for Fear of Offending Muslim Migrants."" Yet nothing could be further from the truth. Sweden hasn't banned Christmas, nor has it banned any form of Christmas decorations apart from those attached to street poles. Its justification wasn't ""fear of offending Muslim migrants,"" but rather unauthorized use of electricity and public safety concerns.As part of their apparent effort to generate anti-immigrant hysteria, some of these sites also repeated false reports of ""no-go zones"" overrun with lawless migrants in Swedish cities. In September 2016, according to the news site The Local, an official of the Swedish Embassy in Hungary (where rumors of immigrant-caused chaos in Sweden and other parts of Europe were proliferating) said no such zones, ""however they are labelled or defined,"" exist in Sweden.:"
361,361,544.IsBarackObamatheAnti,"Claim:The Book of Revelation describes the anti-Christ as someone with characteristics matching those of Barack Obama.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Revelation (the final book of the New Testament) and Nostradamus' Prophecies are two all-purpose befuddling works.  If you want to sow fear, uncertainty, and doubt (or simply yank people's chains), simply claim that some prominent person or recent event corresponds to descriptions that presage the end of the world, as elaborated by Revelation or Nostradamus.  After all, comparatively few people have read either of those works; most people just have some vague idea that they describe, in detail, a coming apocalypse and the signs that will herald its imminent arrival.  So pick your target, make up a list of reasons to explain how it supposedly matches up with end-of-the-world predictions, and watch the process of bewilderment begin.  (We saw this happen in spades with bogus Nostradamus prophecies immediately after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.)  :The item quoted above, linking presidential candidate Barack Obama with the figure of the anti-Christ, is more of the same type of denigrative fiction.  Contrary to popular belief, the New Testament book of Revelation (not ""Revelations,"" as it is commonly rendered) does not provide a laundry list of signs for identifying the appearance of an anti-Christ.  In fact, it neither uses the term ""anti-Christ"" nor describes such a figure; Chapter 13 of that book merely recounts the appearance of ""beasts,"" who are depicted in animalistic terms (as rendered in the King James version of the Bible):And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.:And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? Who is able to make war with him?And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.If any man have an ear, let him hear.He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.:And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.:And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.The term ""anti-Christ"" is mentioned several times in the first and second letters of John, but none of those passages specifically describes or identifies the anti-Christ figure (other than as a denier of the divinity of Jesus):Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.:Nothing in the Bible, in Revelation or elsewhere, describes the anti-Christ as being ""a man, in his 40s, of Muslim descent."" In fact, since the book of Revelation was complete by the end of the second century, yet the religion of Islam wasn't founded until about four hundred years later, the notion that Revelation would have mentioned a ""Muslim"" at all is rather far-fetched.  (And even if it did, it couldn't be construed as a reference to Barack Obama, since he isn't a Muslim.)A July 2009 video purportedly demonstrating how ""Jesus revealed the name of the anti-Christ"" to be ""Barack Obama"" was publicized by the disreputable WND web site::Salon pointed out some of the questionable linguistic manipulations employed in the video and noted that:The linguistic twists needed to produce the whole theory give away the game. Once you start playing around with language and deliberate mistranslations, of course, it's not too hard to come up with something that fits whatever preconceived notions you may have already had. ""It would take us about a half an hour to come up with a crackpot theory, and we can make just about anybody into either the Messiah or the Antichrist"" by picking and choosing words from the Bible, [Rabbi Dan Ehrenkrantz, president of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College] says.""[The video] doesn't hold up even within its own silly logic,"" Ehrenkrantz says. In essence, the whole video seems to be the political conspiracy theory equivalent of taking a phrase and running it back and forth among different languages in Babelfish until it becomes gibberish.The Biblical citation most relevant to this issue might not be one from Revelation, but rather this passage from the Gospel of Matthew: ""Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves."":"
362,362,352.DebunkingTrumpTweets,"Claim:Trump's legal supporters won ""a major injunction"" in their quest to overturn election results in Georgia.Rating:OutdatedAbout this rating On Nov. 29, 2020, President Donald Trump retweeted a claim that #TeamKraken (the nickname for persons seeking to overturn Trump's election loss to Joe Biden) had won ""a major injunction"" in Georgia (a state Trump lost to Biden by about 13,000 votes) resulting in ""an order to freeze all [voting] machines"" there::#TeamKraken had filed a lawsuit a few days earlier seeking, among other things, to force Georgia officials to de-certify the election results, to enjoin them from transmitting the already-certified vote results to the Electoral College, to order the governor to declare Donald Trump the winner of the election, and to require that all voting machines be ""seized and impounded immediately for a forensic audit.""The big win for #TeamKraken had supposedly been the issuance of an order enjoining the State of Georgia from ""wiping or resetting any voting machines in the [state] until further order of the Court""::That alleged victory, such at it was, proved to be short-lived, however::U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Batten initially granted a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) requiring the State of Georgia ""to impound and preserve the voting machines in the State of Georgia, and to prevent any wiping of data.""  However, shortly afterwards Batten reversed himself and denied the request for a TRO because the voting machines in question are not under the control of the defendants in the case (i.e., Georgia state officials), but rather under the control of Georgia county officials (who were not named in the lawsuit):Plaintiffs contend that Union County officials have advised that they are going to wipe or reset the voting machines of all data and bring the count back to zero on Monday, November 30. On this basis, Plaintiffs seek a temporary restraining order to impound and preserve the voting machines in the State of Georgia, and to prevent any wiping of data. However, Plaintiffs' request fails because the voting equipment that they seek to impound is in the possession of county election officials. Any injunction the Court issues would extend only to Defendants and those within their control, and Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that county election officials are within Defendants' control. Defendants cannot serve as a proxy for local election officials against whom the relief should be sought. Therefore, to the extent Plaintiffs seek emergency relief to impound and preserve the voting machines, that request is denied.:Whether or not the voting machines in Georgia are impounded and/or wiped, the end result is unlikely to be of any import.  The state certified its vote after performing a statewide Risk-Limiting Audit of all votes cast which ""upheld and reaffirmed the original outcome produced by the machine tally of votes cast,"" and claims by #TeamKraken that machines manufactured by Dominion Voting Systems were part of a massive voting fraud conspiracy which deprived Trump of a lawful victory were contradicted by Dominion spokesman Michael Steel, who explained that the alleged switching of votes from Trump to Biden could not have occurred because it was ""physically impossible"":""Well, it's physically impossible,"" Steel said of vote switching. ""Look, when a voter votes on a Dominion machine, they fill out a ballot on a touch screen. They are given a printed copy which they then give to a local election official for safekeeping. If any electronic interference had taken place, the tally reported electronically would not match the printed ballots. and in every case where we've looked at -- in Georgia, all across the country -- the printed ballot, the gold standard in election security, has matched the electronic tally.""""We simply provide a tool to count the ballots -- to print and count ballots,"" he said. ""There is no way such a massive fraud could have taken place, and there are no connections between our company and Venezuela, Germany, Barcelona, Kathmandu, whatever the latest conspiracy theory is."":"
363,363,227.WeretheWordsHailSata,"Claim:The phrase ""Hail Satan"" was embossed on the U.S. $10,000 bill.Rating:FalseAbout this rating The United States hasn't issued any currency any larger than $100 bills since 1945, but at one time the U.S. had in circulation $500, $1,000, $5,000, and even $10,000 bills. A claim that appears around certain conspiracy theory-oriented corners of the Internet is one about the now discontinued, but real, US $10,000 bill. According to this particular theory, the words ""Hail Satan"" are embossed into the bill as a subliminal message, presumably to subtly either encourage or remind rich people to worship the Devil. These stories appear from time to time along with variations of the following images::: The $10,000 bill was first printed in 1928 and featured an image of Salmon P. Chase, the Secretary of the Treasury under President Lincoln who oversaw the first issuance of ""greenback"" notes in 1861. Although none of us had a $10,000 bill readily available, an image of this bill provided by the National Numismatic Collection clearly shows that the currency does not contain the phrase ""Hail Satan,"" or any other similar hidden words::Rumors abound about images or words supposedly hidden in currency, either to send a message or to subtly manipulate populations. For example, a U.S. flag cannot be seen on a Canadian $2 bill, President Obama did not remove the words ""In God We Trust"" from American currency and a stack of pancakes does not appear on the $5 bill, no matter how ingeniously it is folded."
364,364,696.CicerosTwoThousandYe,"Claim:The Roman orator Cicero issued a warning about a nation's being destroyed by ""treason from within.""Rating:MisattributedAbout this rating In July 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump was the target of many critics who took umbrage with his appearing to take the side of Russian president Vladimir Putin over allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.As Trump stood next to the Russian president at a press conference following a Russia-United States summit meeting in Helsinki, Finland, Associated Press White House reporter Jonathan Lemire asked Trump whether he believed Putin's denials about Russian interference in the election, or the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that such interference had indeed taken place. Trump replied that he didn't ""see any reason why it would be"" Russia who meddled in the 2016 election, saying that ""I have great confidence in my intelligence people,"" but adding that ""President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial, today"":: President Trump later backtracked on his remark, asserting that he had intended to say ""I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be Russia"" who meddled in the election, and affirming that ""I accept our intelligence community's conclusion that Russia's meddling in the 2016 election took place"": :However, by that time President Trump's remarks in Helsinki had prompted a wave of criticisms, including from within the Republican party, with some observers even accusing President Trump of treason. Most prominently, John Brennan, the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, maintained that Trump's words and actions were ""nothing short of treasonous"":Donald Trump's press conference performance in Helsinki rises to & exceeds the threshold of ""high crimes & misdemeanors."" It was nothing short of treasonous. Not only were Trump's comments imbecilic, he is wholly in the pocket of Putin. Republican Patriots: Where are you???-- John O. Brennan (@JohnBrennan) July 16, 2018Democratic Congressman and House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland endorsed Brennan's description in comments he offered reporters, and the New York Daily News' front page carried the punning banner headline ""OPEN TREASON""::.@realdonaldtrump derides reports with which he disagrees as ""fake news,"" then buys the Russian narrative hook, line, sinker, pole and boat. https://t.co/TGHurpVDKyAn early look at Tuesday's front... pic.twitter.com/BXsoZsIT4B-- New York Daily News (@NYDailyNews) July 16, 2018Against that background, an old warning about a nation's being destroyed by ""treason from within,"" purporting to be from the Roman orator Marcus Tullius Cicero (better known as ""Cicero""), found popularity on social media after a Facebook page called ""Impeach Trump, Impeach Pence, Keep Impeaching"" posted it in the form of a meme on 14 July 2018, two days before the Helsinki summit::Although these words are now widely attributed to Cicero, in fact they originated in the 20th century, with novelist Taylor Caldwell's 1965 book A Pillar of Iron. Even though that work often drew directly from the recorded speeches and letters of Cicero for its dialogue, it was nonetheless a work of fiction, and the warning from Cicero about ""treason from within"" was an invention of Caldwell's and not a reproduction of Cicero's own words.ContextIn one section, Caldwell wrote about the Cataline Conspiracy, a major event in the history of the Roman Republic in which a Senator named Lucius Sergius Catilina (known as ""Catilina"") led a plot to set fire to the city of Rome and assassinate several high-ranking officials -- including the republic's two consuls, Cicero and Gaius Antonius Hybrida (known as ""Hybrida"").The Roman republic was led by two executives, known as ""consuls"", who were elected to one-year, non-consecutive terms by the Centuriate Assembly (composed of Roman citizens). The assembly elected Cicero and Hybrida to serve as consuls in 63 B.C.E, much to the resentment of Catilina, who had unsuccessfully campaigned for the same office.:Cicero found out about Catilina's conspiracy and, invoking emergency powers, had some of its leaders arrested and executed without trial. Catilina himself was killed in battle alongside his troops, while attempting a somewhat futile march on Rome. Five years later, a Roman politician named Publius Clodius Pulcher (""Clodius"") proposed a set of laws, including one which would make it punishable by death to execute any Roman citizen without trial. As a result, Cicero faced the prospect of being exiled from Rome, or even executed, over his earlier order to put to death the leaders of the Catiline conspiracy. These events prompted the imagined scene in which Caldwell put the words in question into Cicero's mouth, as he defended his actions before the Senate:Catilina menaced Rome. That is now history. There was no time for the proper processes of law, as well, my lords, you know. Catilina should have taken any legal time to complete his plans, to fire Rome, to destroy her, to massacre tens of thousands, including many in this Senate, to have brought chaos and disaster to our country. The hour was desperate; moments were precious. There could be no delay. Rome must strike, or Catilina would.For this day's work, lords, you have encouraged treason and opened the prison doors to free the traitors. A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and he carries his banners openly against the city. But the traitor moves among those within the gates freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears no traitor; he speaks in the accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their garments, and he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation; he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of a city; he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to be feared. The traitor is the carrier of the plague. You have unbarred the gates of Rome to him.:Cicero went into exile, as the historians Plutarch and Cassius Dio recounted, but only for around a year before returning to Rome after the Senate voted in favor of recalling him. In 43 B.C.E., he was assassinated at the behest of Mark Anthony, a supporter of Julius Caesar's who served in the Second Triumvirate after Caesar's assassination. These facts provide one clue that the quotation in the meme is not authentic as offered: it is dated to 42 B.C.E., a year after Cicero died.Cicero did not write or utter the words attributed to the fictionalized version of him created by Caldwell, and we found no evidence of any similar phrases occurring in either the orator's own letters and speeches or the accounts of historians such as Plutarch and Cassius Dio who documented this period in Roman history.However, Cicero did vehemently attack Catilina (as he similarly attacked many other Roman politicians, throughout his career) in a series of speeches known as the Catiline Orations, delivered in the Roman Senate during the Catiline Conspiracy and after the capture of its ringleaders.:The speech from Caldwell's novel at times resembles Cicero's actual attacks on Catilina in certain stylistic ways -- for example Cicero's description of Catilina's secrecy and underhandedness, in the first oration:For what is there, O Catiline, that you can still expect, if night is not able to veil your nefarious meetings in darkness, and if private houses cannot conceal the voice of your conspiracy within their walls;--if everything is seen and displayed? Change your mind: trust me: forget the slaughter and conflagration you are meditating.Cicero likened Catilina and his co-conspirators to a disease upon the Roman republic, and also warned about the threat from within the city, just as he did in Caldwell's fictional speech, describing Catilina as ""an enemy in the city"" and declaring that ""The only plots against us are within our own walls -- the danger is within -- the enemy is within.""Usage in American Political Debate:Caldwell's ""treason"" speech, falsely attributed to Cicero, has occasionally featured in American political debate for decades,in various contexts, and with various politicians or ideologies positioned as the ""traitor"" in question.In fact, the misattribution began within months of the publication of A Pillar of Iron. In October 1965, the segregationist Chief Justice of the Florida Supreme Court, Millard Caldwell (no relation to the author), gave a speech to the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons using an extended metaphor to compare the decline of the Roman republic with the perceived decline of conservative mores and individual rights in the United States at that time.Among a series of correctly attributed quotations from Cicero, Caldwell included the ""treason"" speech from A Pillar of Iron, which had been a best-seller that year, adding: ""Does that sound like 1965 and the subversives in high places who have been exposed, and those who are not yet exposed?""In May 1995, the Militia of Montana (a paramilitary anti-government group known for spreading conspiracy theories) was invited to give a statement to the U.S Senate Judiciary committee's subcommittee on terrorism, which was examining the subject of domestic terrorism just weeks after the Oklahoma City bombing.:In their statement, the militia group included a section of Caldwell's ""treason from within"" speech, although not attributing to any source:May God be with all America as he watches over the shoulders of you who write her laws. A nation can survive its fools and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. America has nothing to fear from patriots maintaining ""vigilance."" She should, however, fear those that would ""outlaw"" vigilance. In recent years, internet users taking part in political debates have used the quotation to target ""progressives,"" in the context of the reauthorization of the Patriot Act in 2006, the administration of former U.S. president Barack Obama, in the context of the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal.Another statement about the necessity of balancing budgets, also part of the dialogue invented by Taylor Caldwell for A Pillar of Iron, has similarly been attributed as the genuine words of Cicero for the last several decades. (A more recent list wrongly ascribed to Cicero's offering of a description of ""the situation during his lifetime"" originated with a source other than Caldwell's book.):The application of the faux Cicero ""treason"" quotation to President Trump began before his Helsinki press conference with Putin, and this ""Two thousand year old warning"" meme appears to have first been posted in August 2017 by the anti-Trump Facebook page ""Politicked."""
365,365,424.HillaryClintonUsedHa,"Claim:Hillary Clinton and moderator Lester Holt rigged the first presidential debate by communicating via secret hand signals.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Just when we thought we'd had our fill of debate-related conspiracies, a new one came along, this one in the form of a video purportedly documenting that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and moderator Lester Holt had colluded to rig the first presidential debate through a system of secret hand signals::Scratching one's face is one of the oldest signals in the book. You can be sure if this was a blackjack table and the house noticed a player making similar signals to a dealer they'd be investigated.When the alt-right web site True Pundit shared the video, they did so along with the additional claim that Clinton had never made similar gestures in previous debates, campaign appearances, or speeches::Before critics view this video and scream Conspiracy, True Pundit cross referenced Clinton's speeches, campaign appearances and her 2008 debate performances against President Obama. According to that analysis, Clinton never previously used these hand motions to supposedly scratch her face. In fact, she rarely touches her face at all. (So, you haters can save the trouble of instructing people to remove their tin-foil hats.)The above-displayed video does not provide any evidence that Hillary Clinton and Lester Holt communicated via hand signals so that Clinton could indicate to Holt when she wanted him to call on her so she could get in a ""zinger."" The creator of the video simply strung together several unrelated events -- Clinton scratching her face, Holt making a comment, Clinton replying to Trump -- and then claimed that they were somehow connected to a furtive signaling plot without providing any proof.But before we dig deeper into the video, let's look at the accompanying claims about it from True Pundit and Infowars.:Hillary Clinton has been in the public eye for decades. She was the First Lady of Arkansas in 1983, the First Lady of the United States in 1993, a U.S. Senator in 2001, a presidential candidate in 2008, Secretary of State in 2009, and and a presidential candidate again in 2016. It is simply ridiculous to claim that Clinton never once touched her face during a speech, campaign rally, or debate: : It should be noted that Hillary Clinton was not the only one making these gestures during the first presidential debate::It should also be noted that (as shown in the image at the head of this page) the two candidates were physically separated on the stage, and therefore in order to catch the supposed ""signals"" from Hillary Clinton, moderator Lester Holt -- who didn't have the advantage of the split-screen shot presented to television viewers -- would had to have been rather obviously watching her even when she was not speaking.If Donald Trump truly ""dominated the early part of the debate"" but then lost his advantage, the more logical explanation is that his opponent's strategy to throw him off his game simply worked as expected:The quiet Mr. Trump took the first shift, presenting a general-election version of his forceful campaign persona minus the bluster, insults and defenses of his anatomy. He pushed his case firmly, hitting his campaign's focal points on the economy and trade.But it didn't take long for Mrs. Clinton to find the other Mr. Trump under that thin second skin. Her needling began immediately. She referred to her opponent as ""Donald,"" where he pointedly called her ""Secretary Clinton."" (""Yes, is that O.K.?"" he asked at his first reference to her.) She referred to his starting a business with a ""$14 million"" loan from his father, which Mr. Trump preferred to call a ""very small loan.""The digs targeted Mr. Trump's status and founding mythos, triggering his image-protection reflex. He became combative and rattled, letting his opponent lead him down rhetorical detours (at one point he revived an old feud with Rosie O'Donnell) knowing that he would follow his ingrained ABCs: always be counterpunching.It was Tony Soprano vs. Dr. Melfi, TV's biggest antihero blustering against the woman who had gotten inside his head.:This conspiracy theory also doesn't account for the much more obvious approach that if Hillary Clinton really wanted to say something during the course of the debate when it wasn't her turn to speak, she could simply have interrupted her opponent rather than invoking secret hand signals and waiting to be called upon by the moderator -- as she did in fact do multiple times ... while Donald Trump also did so, but three times as often."

Rating:FalseAbout this rating George Soros, perhaps the most maligned and lied-about public figure alive, was once again the target of another garbled and malicious rumor in February 2019, when conspiracy theory websites reported the ""breaking news"" that he had been arrested in Switzerland -- based on information provided by former U.S. President Barack Obama, who had himself been charged with treason against the United States and detained at Guantanamo Bay for a month.:Soros, an 88-year-old financier and philanthropist known for championing and funding pro-democracy and civil society causes, has for years been the subject of widespread slander, misinformation and conspiracy theories, many of which we have examined and debunked.In October 2018, alleged domestic terrorist Cesar Sayoc was charged with mailing a pipe bomb to the homes of several prominent perceived liberal public figures and organizations, including Soros, Hillary and Bill Clinton, and Barack and Michelle Obama.  Sayoc's social media profiles indicated that he had an obsessive hatred of Soros, one fueled by years of false, inflammatory and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and allegations against him.:On 3 February, BeforeItsNews.com -- a junk news web site with a long record of publishing risible conspiracy theories and misinformation -- posted the following incoherent account of the purported arrest of Soros by a fictional coalition known as ""the Alliance"" (or the ""Earth Alliance"") and implicated Soros in a web of purported evildoing extending to ritual Satanic child abuse:George Soros was said [sic] arrested in Switzerland at 13:23 GMT on Feb. 3 2019. Evidently members of what was known as the Alliance stormed his retreat at Saint Margrethenberg, Switzerland based on a tip from local police. The Alliance was a military force working under orders of the Pentagon, GITMO Military Tribunal Judges and in conjunction with legal entities across the globe.Soros has been suspected to illegally influence US elections over the years, was thought behind thousands of immigrants forcing their way across the US Border, his organizations were believed to own and control software used in state voting machines and even worse, the multi billionaire was known to be a leader in the Vatican's Ninth Circle Satanic Cult. He was thought behind regularly scheduled Satanic Child Sacrifice Rites and Human Hunting Parties organized under the Vatican and involving children and kidnapped teens across the globe ...:In something of a ""grand slam"" of conspiracy theories, the article claimed that the arrest of Soros was based on information provided by former U.S. President Barack Obama, who -- purportedly charged with treason for his involvement in two other debunked but resilient conspiracy theories relating to the 2012 attack on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi, Libya and the ""Uranium One"" saga -- had been detained at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba:Evidently the Alliance had enough evidence supplied by former US President Barak [sic] Obama and other informants at GITMO to arrest Soros. Obama was believed to have been incarcerated at GITMO for at least a month, exposing crimes of upper echelons of the Deep State to save his own skin. Obama was thought to have been charged with High Treason for multiple crimes including Uranium One and the Benghazi massacre.Believed to be in poor health Soros was reported to have been prevented from committing suicide with a cyanide pill prior to capture. Presently he was thought to be under interrogation at a bunker near Gasternal, Switzerland.This conspiracy theorist fantasy was republished on blogs and web sites including FreedomForHumanity2016, ConspiracyDailyUpdate, and OperationDisclosure.

367,367,472.DidMelindaGatesWeara,"Claim:Melinda Gates wore an upside-down cross in broadcast interviews in May 2020 to denounce Christianity.Rating:Mostly FalseAbout this rating What's TrueBased on our examination of the videos in question, Melinda Gates did wear a necklace with a pendant in the shape of a cross in interviews.What's FalseAccording to the Church of Satan, an upside-down or inverted cross is not an official symbol of loyalty.What's UndeterminedDue to the low resolution of the video footage and lack of explanation from Gates herself, it cannot be proved whether the cross had four equal arms or one longer arm. Even if the latter were true, whether the cross was intentionally (or unintentionally) flipped upside down is unknown.:Melinda Gates has been a frequent target of misinformation campaigns during the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. So it was perhaps not surprising in May 2020 when her jewelry raised new suspicions among conspiracy theorists that she -- the famous philanthropist and partner to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates -- had sold her ""soul to the devil.""In at least three video segments with journalists that posted online between May 7 and May 11 (via Politico, Yahoo! Finance, and NBC's ""Today""), Gates criticized the U.S. federal government's response to the pandemic under U.S. President Donald Trump and discussed the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's work on finding a vaccine to build people's immunity against COVID-19 to end the crisis. On May 8, Gates tweeted::But it did not appear to be Gates' comments in the video interviews that sparked controversy on social media. Rather, critics fixated on her appearance.She was seen in a series of broadcast interviews wearing a pink blouse, hoop earrings, and a necklace -- the latter of which conspiracy theorists believed to have displayed an upside-down or ""inverted"" cross that symbolized Gates' alleged allegiance to Satan and denouncement of the Christian faith.  A viral Facebook post read::Another popular post, which a YouTuber recited in a May 12 video, said:Roman Catholic Melinda Gates in an interview on TODAY Show pushing hard for a global COVID-19 vaccine was wearing a bright and shiny upside-down cross around her neck. ... Who likes to wear inverted crosses? Satanists, pagans, witches, warlocks, New Agers, most people in Hollywood.:The claim is two-pronged: that Gates did in fact wear an upside-down or inverted cross in video interviews, including for NBC's ""Today"" show, and that an inverted cross is a symbol of Satanic worship.While unpacking the former, keep in mind that Bill and Melinda Gates have been major targets of misinformation campaigns by anti-vaccine advocates and conspiracy theorists for more than 10 years, a result of their foundation's aggressive research to curb health disparities worldwide via vaccines, or shots that build populations' immunity against certain viruses.Yet a new era of dubious claims involving the billionaire couple surfaced during the COVID-19 pandemic, ever since the coronavirus was first reported in humans in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. Doomsday theorists came up with the idea that the Gateses were trying to ""microchip"" or control world populations via a COVID-19 vaccine -- a conspiracy theory that surfaced in various forms, including a doctored image that supposedly showed the words ""Center for Global Human Population Reduction"" inscribed on a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation building.:For the jewelry claim, though, when asked by Snopes if Melinda Gates owned a necklace with an inverted cross, and if she was wearing it during the May 2020 interviews, representatives of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (which handles most media requests for the couple) did not respond to the inquiry as of this writing.Upon examination of the interview footage on the ""Today"" show website, for example, Gates was indeed wearing a necklace that appeared to have a charm in the shape of a cross and one of the cross' arms looked longer than the rest.But here's what makes the answer to the claim murky: It's unclear whether the cross pendant itself had four equilateral arms, like a Greek cross or plus sign, or if it had one longer arm like the Latin cross.For the former theory, it was possible the Greek cross included a rounded clasp to attach the pendant to the necklace chain and that clasp made one of the cross' vertical arms appear longer than it actually was. That was the case in low-resolution photos of Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of former U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, when conspiracy theorists online raised similar questions about her cross-shaped necklace in 2018. A spokesperson for Chelsea Clinton confirmed that she, indeed, sported a ""Greek Cross or an equilateral cross"" around her neck on ""rare occasion."":On the other hand, Gates could be wearing a Latin cross, as critics claim. If that's the case, the next questions are these: Did she purposefully wear the cross upside down or did the charm flip unintentionally?Based on the available evidence, we cannot make that call. We can, however, provide context as to why wearing a cross pendant, even one inverted, may or may not be a statement of Gates' ideologies. In several public statements, including a video interview with a reporter for The Guardian in 2012, Gates has identified as a follower of the Catholic Church. The reporter, for example, described Gates as a ""church-going, believing Catholic"" and Gates did not refute the claim.That piece of her identity could be the reason for why she wore a necklace with a cross in 2020, or not. Nonetheless, according to Catholic Answers, which defines itself as a ""media ministry"" that explains and defends the Catholic faith, even if Gates' cross was upside-down, the piece of jewelry could still be a statement of her devotion to the church. Its website states::The truth of the matter is that the upside down cross (without a corpus, so not a crucifix) is an ancient symbol of St. Peter's crucifixion. Tradition tells us that when St. Peter was martyred, he insisted that he be crucified upside down as he did not believe himself worthy to be crucified in the manner of his Lord.That said, some people believe an upside-down cross is a statement against Jesus Christ, who is revered in Christianity, and in favor of Satan. For example, a 1993 document, titled ""Satanic Cult Awareness"" and sponsored by the U.S. Department of Justice's National Institute of Justice, said an upside-down cross is ""blaspheme of the Christian cross"" and a symbol that law enforcement and criminal justice agencies should be aware of. :On page 40 of the document:But many people who call themselves Satanists reject the inverted cross as an official symbol. According to the Church of Satan, which  Encyclopaedia Britannica defines as ""counterculture group founded in the United States in the 1960s,"" the group's main symbol is the Sigil of Baphomet, incorporating a pentagram, a goat's head, and Hebrew letters.Literature has long depicted anyone who has embraced Satan and thus rejected Jesus as having embraced the reversed cross as symbolic of that act. Satanists are free to employ any symbols which they feel have resonance, so if such an upside-down cross has personal meaning they could use it.:Additionally, for some people, the cross with one longer arm could have no meaning at all. In the words of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod:Those are people who do not put any significance into using that symbol -- it's just the trendy thing. ... It means that when you see someone with an upside-down cross, you may not know what the intended message is until, and unless, you ask that person.  In sum, given the fact that an upside-down or inverted cross could mean anything -- including a dedication to St. Peter's crucifixion, not necessarily a symbol of allegiance to Satan and denouncement of Christianity -- and the fact that Gates has publicly identified herself as a member of the Catholic Church, we rate this claim ""Mostly False,"" with the caveat that she did wear a necklace with a cross-shaped pendant for interviews with journalists in 2020 and the position and exact shape of the cross is difficult to discern in available video footage.:"
368,368,453.PearlHarborRumorsWhi,"On Dec. 7, 1941, the Japanese launched a surprise air attack on the United States naval base in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, killing more than 2,400 Americans, sinking or damaging more than a dozen warships, and destroying more than 180 aircraft. The next day, in a speech memorializing the incident as ""a date which will live in infamy,"" U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked Congress for a formal declaration of war. Japan's allies, Germany and Italy, responded days later by declaring war on the United States. It was America's official entry into World War II.The scope and severity of the event and its consequences made it a ripe target for rumors, then and now. We've gathered together all of our fact checks on Pearl Harbor in hopes of shedding light on a few of the many misconceptions surrounding it. Did internet users find proof that Pearl Harbor was an ""inside job""?Long before the phrase ""false flag"" became a household word (largely thanks to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on U.S. soil and the ""9/11 Truth"" movement they inspired), there were rumors that the United States government knew in advance that the Pearl Harbor attack would occur and allowed it to happen for strategic reasons. Here, we report that an argument advanced via social media to ""prove"" that thesis (which is still under debate three-quarters of a century after the fact) was nothing more than a gag.

In the chaotic aftermath of the surprise Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, three U.S. sailors would find themselves entombed alive in the hull of the naval vessel settled in the muddy seafloor of the harbor 40 feet below the surface. A rescue crew could hear tapping noises coming from the ship's forward hull but were not able to reach the men in time to save their lives. Read more... Did Joe Biden misremember who attacked Pearl Harbor?""I am an optimist because the American people -- given half a chance -- have never, ever, ever, ever let their country down,"" then-Vice President Joe Biden supposedly said in 2012.

Read more...Were previously unseen Pearl Harbor photographs found in an old camera?:Beginning in 2006, we were flooded with inquiries about a set of vintage photographs circulating with the claim that they were recovered from an Kodak Brownie portable camera that had been stored in a footlocker since 1941. It was easy to establish that they were indeed taken by eyewitnesses to the Pearl Harbor attack, mainly because we'd seen each and every one of them before. Read more... Is a vintage Pearl Harbor color photograph real?Color photographs of the Pearl Harbor attack do exist, as well as many colorized versions of black-and-white photos taken on that day. One image in particular touted as an ""amazing"" color photograph of a bombed warship sinking in flames aroused our suspicions, however. It turned out to be of much more recent vintage than all the others. Read more... Did ""The Green Hornet"" radio show change Kato's nationality after Pearl Harbor?:""The Green Hornet"" was a very popular American radio drama in the 1930s and '40s (later to become a popular television series) about a masked crime-fighter accompanied on his adventures by a Japanese valet named Kato. Longstanding legend has it that the show's writers abruptly changed Kato's nationality amidst an anti-Japanese backlash in the United States after Pearl Harbor. The deeper we looked into what really transpired, the more complex and interesting the story became. Read more... Did ads for a mysterious game called ""The Deadly Double"" contain coded warnings in advance of Pearl Harbor?Two weeks before the attack on Pearl Harbor, mysterious magazine ads appeared for a never-before-seen board game called ""The Deadly Double."" The ads featured an illustration depicting a pair of dice, one showing the number 12, the other showing the number 7. It has been conjectured ever since that the s may have been an advance warning -- to whom, no one could figure out -- that an attack on the United States would occur on 7 December.

The person's mask appears to be slipping off through loose-appearing skin around her neck, proving that she is posing as Harris.Rating:FalseAbout this rating U.S. President Joe Biden's State of the Union speech on Feb. 7, 2023, came with its fair share of absurd rumors, but one pertaining to Vice President Kamala Harris was especially preposterous. A number of TikTok users claimed that rolls of skin that appeared to be looser around Harris' neck were actually indicative of a mask slipping off, revealing that someone else was sitting in as her behind Biden during his speech.:This tweet asked, ""Who Do They Have Wearing The Kamala MASK?"" while posting a video that said, ""what is this creature that doesn't breathe and has fish gills [...]."" The video repeatedly zooms in on Harris' neck where her skin hangs loosely around her face. Other videos on TikTok make the same claim, with one calling her ""reptilian"" and saying her neck is ""peeling."" : :Harris' neck is not peeling, nor is a mask coming off to reveal someone else sitting in her place. In the below video, at various points, natural wrinkles and lines can be seen on Harris' neck as she claps and stands up:Harris is not a reptilian creature with gills. The appearance of sagging skin around the neck is largely due to the angle of the head and the camera in some instances, and her own aging. :You can see her in photographs at different points, and her neck appears normal.

(Nathan Posner/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)(Nathan Posner/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)The claim appears to be an example of the ""body double"" conspiracy theory we have encountered before. The theory usually relies on poor-quality footage, or edited images, to claim that famous people in public are cloned or using body doubles. In this case, the claim also relies on body shaming to pretend that more sinister forces are at play. We therefore rate this claim as ""False."" "

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.Thursday could be a big day. On March 4, Donald Trump will be triumphantly returned to power to help save the world from a shadowy syndicate of Satan-worshipping pedophiles - or at least that is what a small fraction of American citizens believe.But before you circle the date and dust off the MAGA hats, a note of caution: We have been here before. Adherents of the same conspiracy theory, QAnon, had previously marked Jan. 20, the day of Joe Biden's inauguration, as the big day. As Biden ascended the steps of the Capitol to take the presidential oath of office, tens of thousands of adherents of QAnon were eagerly awaiting the imminent arrest and execution of Democratic politicians in a ""storm"" that would upend the social and political order. It didn't happen.:In the aftermath of this disappointment, some disillusioned QAnon followers left the fold. But as evidenced by the new date of March 4 - chosen because it was the day for presidential inaugurations until the 20th Amendment was adopted in 1933 - some hardliners claimed they had simply gotten the date wrong. When - or if - that date too passes without incident, a new date may emerge.It might be thought that enough failed predictions would eventually discredit a prophet. But as a philosopher of religion, I know history suggests a more complicated set of possibilities. Apocalyptic movements rarely simply dissolve when prophecies are seen to fail. Indeed, such crises have in the past presented believers with fertile opportunities to reinterpret prophecies. They have even strengthened movements, giving rise to new theories that attempt to explain the shortcomings of earlier ones. The MilleritesThis dynamic played out nearly 180 years ago with the Millerites, members of a 19th-century evangelical Christian movement who were part of an earlier ""Great Awakening"" in U.S. religious history.:A Baptist preacher, William Miller drew on biblical texts and numerology to predict the imminent second coming of Christ. Although Miller did not initially claim to know the exact date, he and his followers offered various predictions. As each passed without incident, the Millerites redid the Biblical math to propose new dates, until finally the movement settled on Oct. 22, 1844.As the expected second advent drew near, many Millerites gave away their possessions in anticipation of Christ's return.A caricature of a Millerite awaiting the end of the world.Library of CongressWhen Oct. 22 came and went without incident, the Millerites were left to reconstruct a worldview that acknowledged what came to be called the ""Great Disappointment."" Miller's followers concluded not that the Scriptures and numerology on which they had based their predictions were false, but simply that they had misunderstood their meaning. In one view, what the predictions foretold were not earthly events, but heavenly ones. :Millerism did not collapse; rather, elements of it were central to the establishment of Seventh Day Adventism, a rapidly growing Protestant denomination that continues to look forward to Christ's return. Crisis pointLooking at how the Millerites dealt with their Great Disappointment gives an insight into how believers navigate what the philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre calls ""epistemological crises."" These are moments when the way someone understands the world is thrown into question by events that don't fit expectations.Epistemological crises are not unique to religion. Anyone who has experienced heartbreak in a relationship, or felt the rug pulled out from under them when unexpectedly fired by an employer, knows that they are a fact of life. Such a crisis undercuts a person's ability to tell the kind of story about themselves that gives order and meaning to life. Left unresolved, it threatens one's understanding of oneself and others.:Yet, such crises don't always prove insurmountable. MacIntyre writes, ""When an epistemological crisis is resolved, it is by the construction of a new narrative, which enables the agent to understand both how he or she could intelligibly have held his or her original beliefs and how he or she could have been so drastically misled by them.""Sometimes the new understanding repudiates the old. Often, however, the new narrative is not a radical departure from the old one, but an improvised and more sophisticated version of it - one that incorporates what had earlier seemed like outlying data points. The Millerites, for example, survived their Great Disappointment by reaffirming their belief that God is at work in ways that humans cannot always fully anticipate.Writing in the mid-20th century, the philosopher Antony Flew suggested that over time, religious beliefs ""die the death of a thousand qualifications."" That is, they are modified beyond recognition, to the point of meaninglessness.But scholars of religion have documented a pattern in which, rather than dying, fringe beliefs evolve, becoming more socially acceptable. As they are gradually disentangled from politics, they come to be thought of as more truly ""religious."":Making sense of disappointmentWhether or not movements like Millerism can move past great disappointments depends in part on the interpretive tools available within the group and the ingenuity of adherents in explaining away their own unfulfilled expectations. It is anyone's guess whether QAnon will survive its current epistemological crisis. And if it does, there is no guarantee that it will emerge chastened.Some commentators have predicted that it will return even more dangerous than before, evolving into increasingly virulent strains. It may well be subsumed within a larger conspiracy theory that seeks to explain the current disappointment in the context of an even more elaborate narrative.Perhaps one day QAnon will take its place within the domesticated pantheon of American civil religion as another benign and depoliticized ""faith."" Then again, it may simply sputter out, dying the death of a thousand qualifications. :But if history is any guide, whether QAnon survives its Great Disappointment will depend on its adherents' ability to successfully explain to themselves how they could have been so drastically misled.Richard Amesbury, Professor of Religious Studies and of Philosophy and Director of the School of Historical, Philosophical and Religious Studies, Arizona State UniversityThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

The article's republishing coincided with an American missile strike retaliating against a chemical attack by the Syrian government on civilians in rebel-held Khan Sheikhoun three days earlier.The Daily Mail article reported having evidence of an impending ""false flag"" attack. (A so-called ""false flag"" is a common conspiracy theory that asserts governments initiate crises -- real or fabricated -- to lay the groundwork for unpopular actions such as confiscating guns, or, in this case, removing a president from power.) Conspiracy web sites claimed the reason for the article's deletion was ""unclear,"" implying that forces intent on hiding a nefarious plot to oust Syrian president Bashar al-Assad pressured the publication to do so.The Daily Mail article, originally published 29 January 2013, reported that U.S. officials had told a British defense company they had been given a ""green light"" for chemical weapons use in Syria that could then be blamed on Assad::Leaked emails have allegedly proved that the White House gave the green light to a chemical weapons attack in Syria that could be blamed on Assad's regime and in turn, spur international military action in the devastated country.A report released on Monday contains an email exchange between two senior officials at British-based contractor Britam Defence where a scheme 'approved by Washington' is outlined explaining that Qatar would fund rebel forces in Syria to use chemical weapons.Barack Obama made it clear to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad last month that the U.S. would not tolerate Syria using chemical weapons against its own people.The idea that the chemical attacks in Syria had been disguised to look like Assad's work, thus giving his adversaries cover to remove him from power, is a pervasive conspiracy theory that has been disseminated by the Assad-allied Russian government. On 11 April 2017, RT, a Kremlin-funded media outlet, quoted President Vladimir Putin airing that same claim:Russia has information of a potential incident similar to the alleged chemical attack in Idlib province, possibly targeting a Damascus suburb, President Vladimir Putin said. The goal is to discredit the government of Syrian President Assad, he added.""We have reports from multiple sources that false flags like this one - and I cannot call it otherwise - are being prepared in other parts of Syria, including the southern suburbs of Damascus. They plan to plant some chemical there and accuse the Syrian government of an attack,"" he said at a joint press conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella in Moscow.Damascus denied the allegations, noting that the targeted area may have been hosting chemical weapons stockpiles belonging to Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) or Al-Nusra Front jihadists.:But Truth Theory and other sites that re-posted the old Daily Mail story failed to note that the article wasn't deleted due to pressure from an evil globalist cabal, but instead was taken down because the publication admitted it was untrue. The Daily Mail apologized to officials of Britam Defence and paid damages for libel after admitting the ""leaked e-mails"" were actually forged by a hacker.One of the fake e-mails read:PhilWe've got a new offer. It's about Syria again. Qataris propose an attractive deal and swear that the idea is approved by Washington.We'll have to deliver a CW to Homs, a Soviet origin g-shell from Libya similar to those that Assad should have. They want us to deploy our Ukrainian personnel that should speak Russian and make a video record.Frankly, I don't think it's a good idea but the sums proposed are enormous. Your opinion?Kind regardsDavid:Carter-Ruck, the law firm that represented the defense company, wrote in its Autumn 2013 newsletter of the case:The Mail's allegations were based on emails said to have been sent between two Britam directors, which had been published on the internet after Britam's computer systems had been illegally hacked. In fact, however,the emails were forgeries. They had been fabricated and published online by the hacker, whose activities remain the subject of a number of criminal investigations.Faced with these facts, the Mail accepted that the allegations it had published were completely false. In addition to publishing a prominent apology on its website and in the High Court, the Mail paid the company and the two directors PS110,000 in libel damages, together with their legal costsThe 18 April 2013 Daily Mail apology read:An article on 29 January reported allegations on the internet that the US Government had backed a plot to launch a chemicals weapons attack in Syria and blame it on the Assad regime.The reports made reference to an email said to have been from David Goulding, the Business Development Director of Britam Defence, to company founder, Philip Doughty. The email had been published on the internet after Britam's computer system was illegally hacked in Singapore. It referred to a proposal that Britam would deliver chemical weapons to Syria for enormous financial reward and suggested that the directors were willing to consider the illegal proposal.We now accept that email was fabricated and acknowledge there is no truth in any suggestion that Britam or its directors were willing to consider taking part in such a plot, which may have led to an atrocity.We apologise to each of them and have agreed to pay substantial damages.:The Daily Mail's publisher paid PS110,000 in damages to the firm."

Many consumers likely would have never heard of the brand were it not for the National Catholic Register website's fixation with seeing demonic forces at work in marketing efforts.:The Register interviewed a purported Catholic monsignor, John Esseff of Scranton, Pennsylvania -- who also functions as the local exorcist -- to weigh in on Dion's new unisex clothing line for a 21 November 2018 article headlined ""Exorcist Warns About Celine Dion's Occult Children's Clothing.""In that article, Esseff was quoting as saying, ""The devil is going after children by confusing gender. When a child is born, what is the first things we say about that child? It's a boy, or it's a girl. That is the most natural thing in the world to say. But to say that there is no difference is satanic.""That article, and others which were subsequently aggregated from it, were based on some rather far-fetched opinions. None of the clothes in the Celinununu line incorporates demonic imagery. Many feature large plus-signs that resemble the cross on the Swiss flag, some are emblazoned with stars, others bear skulls, while still others carry the phrase ""New Order.""When asked about criticism of the new clothing line, Dion told women's lifestyle webiste Refinery29, ""Anytime you introduce change, you're going to get a bit of pushback -- this is normal. We're also getting a lot of great feedback from people who understand that I'm not trying to tell parents how to raise their children. Every parent should do what they feel is right for them and for their children. We're just offering other choices and letting them know that you don't have to follow stereotypes."":A collaborative effort between Dion and clothing brand Nununu, Celinununu's website offers a description for their vision of its aesthetic and makes no mention of the occult, stating that ""fashion has the power to shape people's minds, inspire your children to be free and find their own individuality through clothes.""In its reporting on the controversy, Yahoo! Lifestyle noted that ""Instead of sending some demonic secret message, it appears Dion's new line just favors minimalism in both shapes and colors. With their simple designs, the clothes are black and white. If anything, Dion is encouraging our children to be goth.""The conspiracy-minded became fixated with shirts bearing the phrase ""New Order,"" apparently confusing it with the popular ""New World Order"" conspiracy theory which asserts that a secret cabal of elites rules the world. The reference for the phrase on the clothes is unclear, but ""New Order"" is the name of an English rock band that became popular in alternative music scenes in the 1980s.Locating exorcists to talk about various social topics they find disagreeable is not a new practice for the National Catholic Register.

Putin attacked these biolabs, according to the conspiracy, in order to stop the spread of a new pandemic. :There is no truth to this rumor. We addressed this rumor more in depth here, but generally speaking, the U.S. does not own or operate biolabs in Ukraine. While the U.S. has provided some funding to upgrade biolabs in Ukraine, these labs are owned and operated by the Ukraine government. Real Raw News Does Not Produce Real NewsReal Raw News is not a genuine news source. It has previously published fictitious articles that falsely claimed Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor had been arrested by U.S. Marines, that former President George W.

None of these stories is based in reality. "
374,374,317.NoAnFBIAgentKilledin,"Claim:One of two FBI agents killed while serving a search warrant in an investigation into violent crimes against children was the top agent in an investigation into child pornography found on Hunter Biden's laptop.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On Feb. 2, 2021, two FBI agents were killed while serving a search warrant in Sunrise, Florida, in an investigation into violent crimes against children. The agents were identified by the FBI as Special Agents Daniel Alfin and Laura Schwartzenberger.:Sadly, it didn't take conspiracy trolls long to pounce on this tragedy, claiming without evidence in memes that Alfin was ""the top investigator for Hunter Biden's laptop"": :This meme reflected another baseless claim that was pushed in the days leading up to the November 2020 election: that a laptop allegedly belonging to then-Democratic candidate Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden contained child pornography. No evidence for this claim has surfaced.That claim stemmed from a bizarre saga which played out in October 2020, when a laptop that allegedly belonged to the younger Biden and was left at a computer repair shop in Delaware was later given by the shop's owner, John Paul Mac Isaac, to a lawyer representing former President Donald Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, who then provided a copy of the laptop's hard drive to the New York Post.Although the paper reported in detail on the contents of that laptop, the New York Post didn't state that they found evidence of child pornography on the laptop. This allegation circulated on various conspiracy sites and social media posts before the election and appeared to echo the Qanon conspiracy theory positing that various high-profile figures, from Democratic legislators to entertainers, are part of a satanic child trafficking ring.:The New York Post story included what it reported were federal subpoenas for the laptop and its contents, which were seized by the FBI in December 2019. Hunter Biden announced in December 2020 that he had learned for the first time that federal authorities were investigating his tax affairs.But the FBI agents who seized Biden's laptop were not the same ones who were serving the search warrant in Florida when the two agents were killed. The Baltimore Sun reported that the federal authorities who took the laptop from the computer shop owner work out of Baltimore and Wilmington, Delaware, and that their investigation involved finances:Isaac said he met with FBI agents in late 2019 and provided them with a timeline of events. The agents returned about two weeks later in mid-December with a grand jury subpoena allowing them to seize the laptop and the external hard drive. The subpoena was signed by a federal prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office in Wilmington who handles criminal investigations such as fraud, and Isaac acknowledged receiving it.The agents also gave him a receipt for what they took, according to a photograph of it published by Fox News. The receipt included an FBI code, 272D, the bureau's internal classification for money laundering investigations, and ""BA"" for its Baltimore field office. Officials separately confirmed that the FBI seized the laptop and an external hard drive as part of an investigation, though they did not detail the inquiry or whether it involved money laundering or Hunter Biden. They also confirmed that the agent who signed the receipt works in Wilmington and is overseen by the Baltimore office.:According to the FBI, Alfin and Schwartzenberger were assigned to FBI's Miami field office. Alfin, who was 36, had worked cases involving crimes against children out of FBI Miami since 2017.Alfin and Schwartzenberger were serving a warrant on David Huber, a 55-year-old computer technician, who engaged agents in a pre-dawn gun battle, killing two FBI agents and wounding three others before turning the gun on himself.We found no real-world connection between Hunter Biden's laptop and the murder of the two FBI agents in Florida, and it appears that claims the two were linked were invented to stir up a specter of conspiracy where none was present."
375,375,179.DidCNNStageaHurrican,"Claim:CNN was caught staging a dramatic rescue during Hurricane Harvey.Rating:FalseAbout this rating A video showing CNN reporter Drew Griffin and his news crew rushing to the rescue of a man who accidentally drove his truck into a small ravine flooded by Hurricane Harvey went viral on 30 August 2017::This footage was widely shared along with praise for Griffin and his crew, but almost immediately some viewers accused the news network of staging the rescue.This particular conspiracy theory, like many conspiracy theories, hinges on nothing more than an incorrect observation: Griffin was allegedly wearing shorts in one portion of the video, but pants in another. InfoWars.com attempted to explain the basis for this accusation:The video then cuts to the moment when the vehicle becomes marooned in the water. After about 20 seconds, Griffin is seen running towards the vehicle. He is wearing khaki shorts and trainers.However, in the next clip, where Griffin is seen pulling the man out of the water, he is now wearing dark pants and boots.Although InfoWars.com provides a set of images showing two men in CNN-branded red jackets -- one wearing shorts and the other wearing pants -- they did not explain how a wardrobe change would prove that this video had been staged, or how changing into pants from shorts would be necessary for the staging of such a video::This is a moot point, of course, as Griffin did not change his clothes during the course of this footage. The four men that can be seen in the video are reporter Drew Griffin (wearing a red jacket and pants), photographer Scott Pisczek (wearing a black shirt and shorts), producer Brian Rokus (wearing a red jacket and shorts), and Jerry Sumrall (the man who was pulled from the truck, who is not wearing a red jacket). Those peddling this claim apparently believe that the man spotted in shorts (around the :31 mark) was reporter Drew Griffin, not his field producer Brian Rokus. But upon reviewing the footage, this is not physically possible. Griffin can be seen running off screen to the left as he chases down the truck down the ravine. When the camera pans over, it shows a second man (Rokus, wearing shorts) who is already standing near the water. Judging by the time that passes between Griffin's departure from the screen, the direction that he was running, and the audio of his footsteps crunching against the grass, it is not possible for Griffin to be the man in shorts.What is even less clear is why CNN -- a company that has been in the video news business for decades -- would put out a hoax video that was so sloppily edited. :Matt Dornic, CNN's vice president of communications, sent us a photograph of Griffin and Rokus on location. Both men are pictured wearing red CNN-branded jackets, as is standard for field reporting and producing:Dornic also called the accusations ""total BS"" in a tweet:?Absolutely absurd and total BS. There are two different people wearing CNN rain jackets. Wish I could say I'm surprised but.. https://t.co/O0zyyfT8iC-- Matt Dornic (@mdornic) August 31, 2017:We were also able to view the raw footage of CNN's rescue, and can confirm that the only things of note edited out of the original footage were a few off-camera curse words and roughly 90 seconds of a blurry street sign. This conspiracy theory hinges on the idea that Drew Griffin changed from shorts to pants in the middle of his report. And although we still aren't sure how this detail would be relevant in the staging of a rescue, this video actually shows two different men, Griffin and his producer Brian Rokus, wearing similar red jackets."
376,376,579.WasLadyGagasSuperBow,"Claim:Lady Gaga's halftime performance at the 2017 Super Bowl took the form of a Satanic ritual.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Easily the most-watched annual sporting event in the United States, the Super Bowl has grown, from its inception as a championship football game in 1967, into an all-day, nationwide entertainment extravaganza. Today's Super Bowl viewer is as likely to tune in for a glimpse of the most expensive TV advertising on Earth, or to catch the glitzy halftime show featuring top entertainers of the day, as to follow the game itself.:The roster of pop stars headlining the Super Bowl has included the likes of Beyonce, Paul McCartney, Katy Perry, Bruce Springsteen, and Madonna. Some of the shows have attained legendary status. When Michael Jackson was booked in 1993, his three-song set garnered higher ratings than the first half of the football game. Eleven years later, when his sister, Janet Jackson, performed a duet with Justin Timberlake between halves of Super Bowl XXXVIII, her breast was exposed on live television, earning the CBS network an FCC fine for indecency and introducing the euphemism ""wardrobe malfunction"" to the English lexicon.When the flamboyant, outspoken Lady Gaga was hired to perform at the 2017 Super Bowl not long after President Donald Trump was inaugurated, there was speculation that she might use her stage time to make a political statement. Gaga, who supported Hillary Clinton in the election and has made many a public statement in support of LGBTQ rights and against bullying, once described Trump as ""one of the most notorious bullies we've ever seen.""'Madonna does it, too':For less coherent reasons, it was also speculated that Gaga was planning to conduct some sort of grotesque Satanic ritual at halftime. Conspiracy theorist and Trump enthusiast Alex Jones issued a video in which he worked himself into a lather detailing alleged connections between Lady Gaga, the ""pizzagate"" scandal, ""spirit cooking,"" meat suits, Satanic rituals, and ""the rise of the robots"":... now we hear about Lady Gaga, who admittedly was part of the whole pizzagate situation, with the spirit cooking lady, the Aleister Crowley events, she admits she has someone sleep in her room at night because she believes a demon's going to attack her. Whether you believe in demons or not, when she wears meat suits and does all these rituals, and Madonna does it, too, the organizers of the Super Bowl are deciding to defile America and break our will by having us bow down to this. And she's reportedly going to be on top of the Super Bowl (they're saying she may cancel doing this), on top of the stadium, ruling over everyone with drones everywhere surveilling them in a big swarm, to just condition them that ""I am the goddess of Satan ruling over you with the rise of the robots,"" in a ritual of lesser magic.By way of clarification (to the extent that's even possible), the ""pizzagate situation""Jones refers to is a thoroughly discredited conspiracy theory (which Jones and his followers nevertheless cling to) holding that former First Lady, U.S. Senator, Secretary of State, and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton runs a child sex ring out of a Washington, D.C. pizzeria.:""Spirit Cooking"" refers to a conceptual art project by performance artist Marina Abramovic which has been misrepresented by Jones and others as an actual ""Satanic"" or ""occult"" ritual in which leaders of the Democratic Party, most notably former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, supposedly participated.The only piece of evidence allegedly implicating Lady Gaga in these supposed ""scandals"" is a viral image people say shows her attending a ""spirit cooking ritual"" led by Abramovic::However, the photograph depicts no such event. It was taken at the 20th Annual Watermill Center Summer Benefit, an art auction supporting residency programs at the renowned arts facility located near Southampton, New York. Along with more than 1,000 other attendees, including many well-known artists and celebrities, Gaga and Abramovic were both guests at the 27 July 2013 event, which, although its stated theme was ""Devil's Heaven"" and it featured purposely shocking avant-garde installations such as the one seen above, had no connection with Abramovic's ""Spirit Cooking"" oeuvre.Born and raised a CatholicBased on her own statements and actions, Gaga's spiritual inclinations might best be described as eclectic, inclusive, or, least charitably, confused. Born and raised a Catholic, she says that although she has had disagreements with the Church she is ""very religious,"" believes in Jesus, and prays. But she also finds religion ""bogus,"" she says, in the sense that most, if not all religions, historically, have persecuted minorities. ""I dream of and envision a future where we have a more peaceful religion, or a more peaceful world, a more peaceful state of mind for the younger generation,"" Gaga told Larry King in a 2010 television interview. She has also promoted the teachings of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan Buddhist leader, and studied meditation with celebrity spiritualist Deepak Chopra, whom she reportedly sought out for counsel after experiencing dreams of being ""haunted"" by the devil.:Dreaming that one is being chased by devils is not the same as worshiping Satan, we submit, despite what rumor-mongers like Alex Jones would have us believe. Nevertheless, in a classic instance of confirmation bias (defined as the tendency to interpret new evidence as proof of what one already believes), Lady Gaga's actual halftime show, which Variety described as unprovocative and ""overall a little weak,"" was condemned by more excitable observers as a ""Satanic performance"" replete with ""ritualistic Illuminati references"" such as ""pentagrams lining the stage, flames, black clothing, and 666 hand symbols over the eyes.""Satan's fallOthers source claimed Gaga's show contained allusions to 9/11, Freemasonry, and the biblical story of the fall of Lucifer::A 6 February 2017 Facebook post shared by close to 60,000 people elaborated on the ""fall of Lucifer"" theme, claiming ""We just saw Satan's fall in theatric [sic] form"":Let me get this straight:So Gaga is standing above all. On the highest point, above all creation in that stadium. Can't get any higher. Stars are lighting up behind her and as the stars are illuminating in the sky she sings about ""god"" and this nation is made for ""you and me""... THEN ...She falls from the highest point, from the stars, to the second high point... with the first words out of her mouth being,""I'm on the Edge of Glory""...Does any of that sound familiar? What scene was just played out? Anyone...Here Let me help...:""How are you fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!How you are cut down to the ground, you who weaken the nations!For you have said in your heart,""I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will sit also on the mount of the congregation, in the recesses of the north; I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most High.""Notice... Nations. stars. Above the congregation (above the stadium of people)... fell from grace (she fell and is on the edge of Glory)...While we are all hypnotized by the light, glamor, sound we are singing and children are hearing...""I want your love, you vertical stick""and lyrics like....""I'm beautiful in my way'Cause God makes no mistakes;I'm on the right track baby I was born this way.No matter gay, straight, or biLesbian, transgendered lifeI'm on the right track baby I was born this way"":Complete blasphemy of Gods creation, defaming and devaluing the Holyness of the father And who does that? Lucifer. He twist the words of God ALWAYS and makes himself look good and God bad.Did the Lord not tell us ""For even Lucifer disguises himself as an angel of light"" -2 Corinthians 11:14Lucifer is the god of this world. He creates all the time reminders about his presence and control over you very frequently. Because most don't know Gods word they do not recognize it.Lady Gaga is not a Christian. She practices many satanic things and because of that her thoughts and ideas come from the fallen kingdom ... not the Lord's. We just saw Satan's fall in theatric form and the entire world clapped and for him and his blasphemy... READ THE BOOK AND OPEN YOUR KINGDOM EYES.Satan is evidently in the 'kingdom eyes' of the beholder:As is obvious from the examples above, anyone can represent themselves as an expert on ""Satanism"" and accuse others of practicing it, but that doesn't mean they know what they're talking about. If you shed such preconceived notions before watching Gaga's actual performance, which opens with her perched on the roof of Houston's NRG Stadium in an acrobatic harness, belting out refrains from ""God Bless America"" and ""This Land Is Your Land"" until she leaps (not falls) to the stage below, you'll wonder how anyone could seriously interpret it as a re-enactment of Lucifer being tossed out of heaven. And those allegedly Satanic ""flashing pentagrams"" adorning the stage? They make much more thematic sense interpreted as five-pointed stars from the American flag.Alex Jones' version of ""Satanism,"" if you recall, was Lady Gaga peering down from the top of the stadium, surrounded by flying drones, as if to say, ""I am the goddess of Satan ruling over you with the rise of the robots."" For what it's worth, we scoured both the old and new testaments of the Bible for references to Satanic robots, and came up empty-handed.So, what was the meaning of Gaga's halftime performance? During preparation for the event, she expressed the hope that it would have a unifying effect on the country. When asked at a press conference a few days before the Super Bowl if she still hoped to do that, and whether she would be making any other kind of statements, she said::Well, I don't know if I will succeed in unifying America. You'll have to ask America when it's over. But the only statements that I'll be making during the halftime show are the ones that I've been consistently making throughout my career.I believe in a passion for inclusion. I believe in the spirit of equality, and the spirit of this country as one of love and compassion and kindness. So my performance will have both those philosophies.... Essentially, that kid that couldn't get a seat at the cool kids table and that kid who was kicked out of the house because his mom and dad didn't accept him for who he was? That kid is going to have the stage for 13 minutes. And I'm excited to give it to them.""The performanceHere, courtesy of the National Football League, is Lady Gaga's full Super Bowl LI halftime performance::"
377,377,605.DisguisingHateHowRad,"Editors' NoteGreat journalistic investigations often beget more investigations, often through fresh leads and perspectives from readers. That's essentially what happened here. Following publication of Snopes.com's expose of faux newspaper sites in key 2020 battleground states, a tipster alerted us to the fact that a response to that article had been shared on a coordinated network of Facebook pages. The result of that lead is this investigation from Alex Kasprak into a web of Facebook pages filled with anti-muslim, anti-immigrant vitriol. Those pages, which we link to an evangelical activist based in Columbus, Ohio, appear to be aimed in part at re-electing U.S. President Donald Trump. We hope you find this latest investigation informative. Keep the tips and feedback coming here.--Doreen Marchionni, managing editor Snopes.com.A coordinated network of evangelical Christian Facebook pages publishing overtly Islamophobic, conspiratorial content paints extreme, divisive right-wing rhetoric as having broad American support but is actually tied to one individual, a Snopes investigation reveals.:These pages claim that Islam is ""not a religion,"" that Muslims are violent and duplicitous, and that Islamic refugee resettlement is ""cultural destruction and subjugation."" Just hours after the April 2019 Notre Dame spire collapse in a catastrophic fire, this network went into overdrive sowing doubt about the possible role Muslims had in its collapse. Multiple pages within this network have stated that their purpose is ""message boosting & targeting."" Ten of the pages within the network explicitly support U.S. President Donald Trump in their titles and belong to an umbrella organization that ""[speaks] up for a Trump-Pence agenda."" A post shared on several of those pages implores readers to ""like our page and let's roll 2020!""These pages, however, are steeped in fantastical notions of ""globalist"" conspiracies linking Islam, Socialism, and multi-billionaire philanthropist and Democratic Party supporter George Soros to the decline of Western civilization. Some of these pages also claim that survivors of the Parkland High School massacre in the U.S., for instance, are on a Soros-funded ""Leftist-Islamist payroll."" In at least one case, these pages have either received financial support from, or been exploited by, a high-profile GOP donor who served as a  fundraiser and campaign board member for 2016 GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson.:Though the actual authorship of the posts within these pages is opaque, their titles imply diverse representation from a broad swath of American demographic groups, including ""Jews & Christians for America"" and ""Blacks for Trump."" In reality, however, the pages in this network are all connected to evangelical activist Kelly Monroe Kullberg. But she is neither black nor Jewish, and her views appear to represent an extreme subset of the broader evangelical movement in America. Though we do not know for sure what individual or individuals created each of these pages, or if Kullberg, her family members, or various ""interns"" write their posts, all of them appear now to be tied financially to Kullberg or to organizations she has created. As far as we have been able to ascertain, Facebook has no problem with the existence of this coordinated network, which we will refer to here as the ""Kullberg network.""This network, and others that employ similar tactics, can affect online discourse in several ways. First, the network serves to influence public opinion by presenting the views of a small group of activists as representative of a much broader swath of the American populace. Second, such a strategy in this case amplifies and offers a veil of legitimacy to hatred and conspiracy theories. Third, in spite of these strategies awash in misinformation, the pages within the network have attracted the financial backing of well-heeled political donors who exploit these pages and groups to disguise the origin of political Facebook ads.:The Kullberg Network24 Pages  1.4M FollowersChristians For Trump All of these pages are listed on the website ""Christians for Trump.""Offline donations on that website go to a P.O. Box shared with the ""American Association of Evangelicals.""The American Association of Evangelicals was founded by Kelly Monroe Kullberg.:American ConservancyAll of these pages were once listed as ""projects"" of, or social media pages belonging to, the ""America Conservancy.""Kelly Monroe Kullberg is the founder and president of The America Conservancy.Despite Its Myriad Pages, The ""Kullberg Network"" Is Tied to One PersonFacebook defines violations of its terms of service or community standards in numerous ways. ""Coordinated inauthentic behavior"" is one such way, in theory. As explained by Facebook Head of Cybersecurity Policy Nathaniel Gleicher in a 6 December 2018 video, the social network broadly defines this activity as ""groups of pages or people work[ing] together to mislead others about who they are or what they're doing."" The term is commonly associated with governmental or foreign intervention in elections, such as Facebook pages created by the Internet Research Agency (IRA), the Russian troll farm found to have influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election. More recently, as another example, Facebook removed a network of pages run by the social media manager of the authoritarian president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte.:The Kullberg network is not a foreign entity. It is a collection of at least 24 Facebook pages apparently run by a small group of people based out of Columbus, Ohio, that purports to represent the views of a diverse cohort of Americans. In many other respects, the network is quite similar to these examples of foreign social media manipulation. In the view of Joshua Tucker, a professor of politics and data science at NYU, the fact that these activities stem from domestic, rather than foreign, actors complicates things. ""I think if you came to Facebook and said, 'Hey, the Russians are doing this,' they would have taken the pages down,"" he told us in a phone interview. So far, Facebook has not responded to our questions or multiple follow-ups about the Kullberg network's practices, and the network remains online.  Tucker, who also is a co-founder and co-director of the NYU Social Media and Political Participation (SMaPP) laboratory, has researched online hate speech and the manipulation efforts of the aforementioned IRA, a major player in the Russian government's online-influence operation in support of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. Tucker told us he has long argued that while foreign social media efforts get much of the attention, ""the people who are always going to have the most incentive to do this kind of thing are the domestic actors."":The Kullberg network, though it appears to be operated entirely in the U.S., inauthentically presents itself as representing the views of Americans of diverse racial and religious backgrounds who range in age from students to seniors. Yet the content and messaging across these pages are largely, if not literally, identical, suggesting that the content across this ""diverse"" network is not written by members representative of those groups, but by Kullberg and/or her small number of associates.:In some cases, these pages even ""interact"" with each other::Each of the pages in this network is connected directly to Kullberg, an evangelical author and activist whose views appear to have shifted away from more mainstream evangelism in the 1990s to a more conspiratorial brand of thought in the 2010s. American evangelism, in general terms, refers to a coalition of protestant Christian traditions united by a belief that salvation requires not only a transformation inspired by the experience of being ""born again,"" but also the active spreading of the gospel. Kullberg's views are not necessarily representative of this broader movement.:Kullberg has described herself as president and co-founder of ""Christians for a Sustainable Economy,"" an organization that cites scripture to justify opposition to federal aid for the poor. In addition, she has been described as ""a moving force behind,"" and a spokeswoman for, an organization called ""Evangelicals for Biblical Immigration,"" which promotes a Biblical rationale for excluding some immigrants and refugees from America. Evangelicals for Biblical Immigration's content has been promoted on white nationalist outlets such as VDARE. Kullberg also founded an organization called the ""American Association of Evangelicals,"" whose message is similar to Evangelicals for Biblical Immigration, but that also argues ""wealthy, anti-Christian foundations, following the lead of billionaire George Soros's Open Society Foundation, fund and 'rent' Christian ministers as 'mascots' serving as surprising validators for their causes.""These organizations, as well as a host of other Facebook pages, were once listed as ""projects"" or social media pages of an organization that appears to have taken shape in 2015 called ""The America Conservancy,"" which, in a recurring theme, listed Kullberg as its founder and president. The remaining pages in Kullberg's network belong to ""Christians for Trump."" This latter organization supports pages that include: Evangelicals for Trump, Women for Trump, Blacks for Trump, Veterans for Trump, Seniors for Trump, Teachers for Trump, Unions for Trump, Catholics for Trump, and Students for Trump-Pence.:Donations to ""Christians for Trump"" currently go to an entity described variously as ""ACA Inc."" or ""AC Action."" The mailing address used to send a physical check to ""AC Action"" is identical to the mailing address of the Kullberg-founded American Association of Evangelicals::This financial link, along with their shared content, joins the 14 pages claimed by the ""America Conservancy"" and the 10 pages that are part of the ""Christians for Trump"" portfolio under one Kullberg roof. According to Brendan Fischer, the director of federal reform at the non-partisan Campaign Legal Center, the ""action"" entities like ""ACA Inc"" and ""AC Action"" could represent the political action arm of America Conservancy. Though Kullberg's America Conservancy is registered in Ohio as a 501(c)(3) organization that is legally precluded from most political activities, Fischer told us that many charitable organizations have a political arm operating under a similar name. In support of this notion, a post on the ""about"" section of the ""Christians for Trump"" Facebook page states that ""ACA is a 501(c)(4)"" group, which is legally allowed to conduct lobbying efforts.In a further example of potentially deceptive practices, the America Conservancy appears to have once existed as a Political Action Committee (PAC) that supported Republican nominee Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election. This PAC, named ""The American Conservancy"" (note the letter ""n"" in ""American,"" which distinguishes this group from the later ""America Conservancy"") terminated operations in 2013. Both Kullberg's organization and this former Romney PAC have listed the same Columbus, Ohio, P.O. Box as their mailing address. Many of the Facebook pages in the Kullberg network once had Romney-specific names that have been changed. ""Moms for America,"" for example, used to be ""Moms for Mitt Romney""::Unclear is what benefit America Conservancy received in taking over the operations of a defunct PAC while changing its name only slightly, outside of potentially acquiring control of old Romney Facebook pages. We reached out to Paul Kilgore, the FEC-registered treasurer for American Conservancy in 2012-2013, multiple times via email and voicemail to clarify these issues but received no response. These mysteries aside, the repurposing of Facebook pages whose original intent served to promote Mitt Romney in 2012 into a tool used to promulgate Islamophobia and conspiracy theories is inherently misleading. This rebranding serves, like other actions taken by Kullberg, to inflate the perceived support for her more extreme positions by implying Romney supporters who have not left those pages are also supporters of Kullberg's specific form of activism.  :The Kullberg network therefore potentially meets the Facebook-defined violation of ""groups of pages or people working together to mislead others about who they are or what they're doing"" in multiple ways. It misleads others by presenting the views of one person and her close associates as the views of multiple different demographics, and it presents a collection of ""informal"" organizations as multiple, independent organizations and not a network that is linked financially to a small group of people, if not a single person, as is actually the case.Indeed, the Kullberg network may not rise to the level of a violation of Facebook's rules as they currently exist. ""I don't even know what it violates,"" Tucker told us. But when viewed in its totality, ""It [the network] really doesn't pass the smell test,"" he said. Either way, it is hard to imagine how the Kullberg network would be anything but deceptive both to potential donors and to Facebook users who come across these organizations on Facebook thinking they are unique entities that heartily agree with one another.We attempted to reach Kullberg several times via multiple methods, including Facebook and webform messages to America Conservancy and American Association of Evangelicals; to Kullberg's personal Facebook account; and to several of her personal email addresses. Following these unsuccessful efforts, we also called a phone number listed in public records as belonging to Kullberg that has also been listed publicly as the contact number for the America Conservancy, as well as a second Kulberg-associated group.:After this reporter identified himself, a woman who answered the phone claimed we had the wrong number.  Follow-up calls from this reporter and another Snopes reporter went to voicemail. Neither voicemail message has been returned. The homepage of the America Conservancy website briefly disappeared and now displays a message that the site is being ""upgraded."" On 28 May 2019, following the initial publication of this story, the Kullberg network was apparently removed from Facebook, and many of Kullberg's various websites had been taken down, though we do not know for sure who facilitated these moves or why.  Islamophobia in the Kullberg Network""Evangelical organizations are the primary funders of anti-Muslim animus,"" Abbas Barzegar, the director of the Department of Research and Advocacy at the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), told us via email. CAIR, a frequent target of the Kullberg network, published a report in May 2019, ""Hijacked by Hate: American Philanthropy and the Islamophobia Network,"" that charted funding flows from anonymous donors to charities to anti-Muslim groups. ""Evangelical groups consistently appear as leading funders,"" he told us.:The views on Muslims expressed by the Kullberg network appear to fall into a ""civilization jihad"" brand of Islamophobia that is growing in strength in some far-right circles, according to Jonathon O'Donnell, who researches the politics of demonization as a postdoctoral fellow at the UCD Clinton Institute for American Studies in Dublin, Ireland. His academic work has investigated the rhetoric of the Center for Security Policy, whose content is frequently promoted on the Kullberg network and that is considered a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.""Civilization jihad essentially refers to the idea that Muslim migration is a ...  deliberate policy of civilizational replacement,"" O'Donnell explained via a Skype call. Terrorist acts, he told us, are ""not the real Jihad to these peoples. The real Jihad is this more subtle form of cultural infiltration and transformation."" Consistent with these themes, several Kullberg network pages shared a 21 March 2019 post describing refugee resettlement as ""cultural destruction and subjugation,"" while another widely shared post argued that ""immigration destroys ... communities.""A consistent message in the Kullberg network is that Muslims are unable to assimilate into American culture. The pages frequently share content claiming that Muslims, including those holding elected positions in the U.S. government, are unable to accept the country's Constitution because of their loyalty to Sharia law. These views were explicitly articulated in a 28 April 2019 post shared among several Kullberg pages that argued ""a normal Muslim's loyalty is to Sharia law and supremacy."" This loyalty is preordained, according to the network. ""That is their lens. It must be. It is and shall be. But it's not compatible with our U.S. oath of citizenship that our ancestors took.""::Muslims, the Kullberg network additionally claims, are violent and duplicitous. One post from May 2017, which used a mischaracterized picture of a Muslim boy with a toy gun, stated that ""Muslims are commanded to imitate Mohammed. Mohammed stole from, raped and killed thousands. This is what Islam means by peace. Let's stop Islamic supremacy. #ItsNotAReligion."" A 1 January 2018 post shared on at least eight pages within the Kullberg network proclaims ""we will NOT submit to Islamist ideology of conquest forcing our submission."" This post promoted the hashtag ""#ShariaKills.""  Muslims, the Kullberg network vigorously and ceaselessly asserts, work with progressives such as Soros to ""exploit Christian teachings to empower those who seek to dismantle Christian civilization."" Soros, these Facebook pages claim, is behind a global, mass-migration movement that serves only to keep him in power while he tries ""to demoralize and destroy"" America. ""Obviously, if you believe that Western civilization as a concept is civilizationally superior ... then you need to account for how this 'inferior' civilization is managing to infiltrate it so successfully,"" O'Donnell said. ""One of the ways they get around that is by positing figures like George Soros as these traitorous insiders who are leveraging the superiority of the West in an effort to undermine and destroy it."":The Kullberg network takes this conspiracy theory to an extreme. For example, posts shared in the network have suggested that the survivors of the Parkland school massacre are bankrolled by Soros and are therefore, evidently, fair targets for online harassment. A 20 August 2018 post accused these survivors of being ""paid to lie and spin for Soros and comrades,"" adding that ""the Left & Islamists work together -- against America.""The rhetoric of the Kullberg network apparently succeeds at stirring a mob mentality of hatred untethered to reality. Responding to another post sowing doubt about the cause of the Notre Dame fire, commenters on the Christians for Trump page shifted their focus back toward the U.S., suggesting that American Muslims were trying to destroy this country in a similar way. ""This is what Omar is doing against America,"" one commenter said, referring to U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, one of two Muslims currently serving in the U.S. Congress and who is a common target of the Kullberg network. ""She's going down, just you wait,"" that individual said. ""Can't happen soon enough for me!"" another responded. Omar has been the subject of an increasing number of death threats following attacks from President Trump and others.:This sort of rhetoric does not necessarily remain isolated on Facebook pages. ""Like other elements of Islamophobia,"" Barzegar told us, ""these tropes and rhetoric are consistently rising across our public and political spaces.""In a 9 June 2019 story published in the local Columbus, Ohio, Dispatch following the original publication of this story, Kullberg provided her first public comment on the matter. In an emailed statement to that paper, Kullberg said the goal of her work was to ""discern truth"", adding that ""any errors in posting were made with regret"":""Public social media pages are often used to help experts on national security, faith and a host of other topics shine light on the persecution of both Christians and Muslims, such as the fact that 3 million Muslim Uyghurs are now in Chinese concentration camps, the horror of the Christchurch (New Zealand) massacre and that 500,000 girls in America are at risk for female genital mutilation,"" Kullberg wrote. ""Any errors in posting were made with regret,"" she wrote. ""The goal of this work is to discern truth and the nature of love in relation to the challenging issues of our times.""GOP Donors Exploit the Kullberg Network for Political AdsDespite its extremist content, the Kullberg network is aided by at least one notable GOP political figure. In 2016, according to a post on their Facebook page, ""Christians for Trump was run by the LibertyT.us PAC.""Based on the Facebook-required branded content tag on some posts within the Kullberg network, ""Liberty T, LLC"" appears to have been the corporate entity that, at least until the end of 2018, paid for ""message boosting and targeting"" within the network. At the same time, in what may be a mutually beneficial relationship, this PAC used Kullberg's network of Facebook pages, which due to their names and profile details appear to represent key constituencies, to serve targeted political ads on the Facebook platform.But figuring out the exact mechanics of these corporate arrangements is challenging. Nobody associated with America Conservancy responded to our questions, and only Anne Peterson, who described herself as ""just the FEC compliance girl"" for Liberty T, responded to any of our inquiries. But she was unable or unwilling to explain what Liberty T's role was in relation to the ""Christians for Trump"" Facebook pages, its operations in general, or its connection to Kullberg.But we do know that during the 2018 election cycle, a man named William Millis provided the lion's share of the funding to Liberty T. Millis, a wealthy North Carolina sock scion and former Ben Carson fundraiser and campaign board member, contributed $50,000 to the PAC on 26 October 2018, according to FEC disclosures. This sum represented over 50% of the funds raised by that organization in the 2018 election cycle. The registered address of Liberty T is the same one used by a currently inactive charity named ""Wounded Warrior Corporation,"" which listed Millis as a director. Another person, listed as the treasurer for Liberty T, was injured in a bike accident and is medically unable to run the organization. As a result, Liberty T is shutting down operations completely, Peterson said.But Liberty T's past involvement in the Kullberg network is illustrative of how such coordinated Facebook networks can be exploited to disguise the source of political messaging. If Liberty T's primary objective was to distribute political ads as representative of the views of various people that they do not authentically represent, the Kullberg network may have allowed them to achieve that goal.As an example, Liberty T paid Facebook for a post purporting to come from the Facebook page ""Blacks for Trump"" in support of then-Kansas gubernatorial candidate Kris Kobach to be ""boosted"" onto the timelines of up to 50,000 Kansans between 2 November and 5 November 2018. This post, however, never actually appeared on the Blacks for Trump timeline. Instead, based on these ads' absences from their respective pages' timelines, Liberty T appears to have paid for what Facebook calls an ""Unpublished Page Post."" Such a post is capable, as this one was, of being shared on the timelines of individuals who are not members of the Blacks for Trump while seemingly being endorsed by that page:On the flip side, Liberty T's funding enabled the messages, interests, and donation pages of Kullberg's various organizations and Facebook groups to see a wider audience, like those tens of thousands of Kansans targeted by Liberty T. Indeed, ""American Conservancy Action, Inc."" (which listed in FEC filings the same P.O. Box once displayed on Kullberg's America Conservancy website) donated $25,000 to Liberty T on 17 October 2018. Following those payments, many of the posts ""boosted"" by Liberty T were general announcements about various Kullberg organizations:In at least one instance, Liberty T appears to have funded the promotion of products created by Kelly Kullberg's family members. Between 5 November and 6 November 2018, the PAC paid for the promotion of an Amazon link to a work of fiction written by David Kullberg, Kelly's husband, titled Breaking Babel. According to the American Association of Evangelicals, the book ""accurately predicted George Soros funding fake ministers to split the faith vote to swing the U.S. presidency, crippling the church & nation"":While the way that Liberty T promotes the interests of the Kullbergs as it uses pages under Kelly Kullberg's control for political-messaging purposes may be apparent, the reason for the shifting money between multiple corporate entities is less obvious. ""It seems hard to imagine why the American Conservancy would pay Liberty T and then disclaim that Liberty T was paying for the ads,"" Fischer, from the Campaign Legal Center, said. ""It's entirely possible that this is just a handful of people who are wearing different hats at any given time.""One benefit of the approach used by the Kullberg network and further enabled by Facebook's ad products and policies is that it makes answering such questions with any certainty challenging.Nobody Wants to Talk About the Kullberg NetworkA striking pattern that emerged in Snopes' reporting on the Kullberg network was that nobody -- from the people or person creating these messages and the political operatives funding them to the digital platform that allows messages to be transmitted to millions of people -- seemed to want anything to do with this story. Multiple inquiries to Kullberg and to the accounts of several of the organizations she runs went unanswered. Multiple inquiries to Liberty T's Millis, including one passed on via registered agent Peterson, also received no response.The same can be said of Facebook, whose press office we contacted three times by email (and which has been responsive to our inquiries in the past). None of those inquiries was returned, but following either our first or our second email to the company, two of the posts we specifically linked to as examples in our email to Facebook (and to no other parties) were deleted: a post targeting the Parkland school shooting survivors, as well as a post arguing the Muslims are violent and that Islam ""isn't a religion."" A third inquiry to Facebook, which reiterated our first two emails, also asked if Facebook had taken action on those posts. Facebook did not respond to that inquiry, either. April 10, 2018: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg (C) testifies at a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C. (Xinhua/Ting Shen via Getty Images)On the one hand, the Kullberg network is both literally and figuratively small change. In addition to being a modest-sized network of up to 1.4 million followers, the corporate entities behind it are not trafficking in huge amounts of money. CAIR's Barzegar told us they had never heard of Kullberg or any of the organizations she is associated with. Similarly, a spokesperson for Soros told us he had never heard of Kullberg or her sites, despite the fact that all of these pages or organizations directly target Soros on a near-daily basis.  On the other hand, the Kullberg network is representative of the effects stemming from Facebook's lack of clarity concerning the nature and enforcement of its own policies and terms of service. For several years, Kullberg has been able to build up a network of discarded political Facebook pages that may serve to add unfounded legitimacy to hateful Islamophobic views. Facebook, meanwhile, has apparently allowed these pages to benefit from the undisclosed or disguised interests of wealthy GOP donors.The potential harm from something like the Kullberg network is hard to quantify, NYU's Tucker said. While many of these pages state or imply by their titles to be efforts in support of Trump for president in 2020, it is unclear how effective online influence from a network like this would actually be. ""In 2016, the election was super close,"" he said, so targeted ads that boosted the turnout of evangelicals in certain areas could in theory be significant. But, he added, ""We can't randomly run an experiment during the election ...  you wouldn't want to do this ethically.""While proving harm on this level may be challenging, it does not take a significant number of radicalized Facebook members to cause harm. Asking if Facebook networks can influence the polls and if they could cause harm by radicalizing people toward violence ""are two different questions,"" Tucker said. ""Unfortunately for these horrendous [hate] crimes that are taking place now, you don't need a large number of people.""Social media companies, Barzegar argued, need to be ""more transparent and collaborative to help create social media spaces that are both robust and promote dialogue, but at the same time guard against the spread of dangerous and potentially violent ideas."" Though silence seems to have been their strategy leading to the publication of this story, Facebook's determination to ignore requests for policy clarification could signify an increasingly dangerous approach. ""Hate groups tend to mushroom in the social media and non-profit sector as they are easy to exploit due to lack of regulation,"" Barzegar told us.The Kullberg network appears to exist in a gray area. Its content is frequently inflammatory, conspiratorial, and dangerously misleading. But such attributes may not be enough to constitute a violation of the platform's rules. The network may not be a significant player from an electoral standpoint, either -- not that many people have been reached by the efforts of Liberty T.Two things are clear, however: Social media platforms like Facebook have allowed hateful Islamaphobic, conspiratorial rhetoric to be amplified and boosted inauthentically on their platforms, and these platforms continue to benefit from the revenue and reach of political operatives who exploit the networks."
378,378,478.NoEvidenceGlobalWarm,"This article by Giulio Corsi is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.Climate change denial is a moving target. In the past, it consisted of a fully fledged denial of any scientific evidence that the world was warming. More recently, it has evolved into a creative mix of strategies. Deniers today often contradict part of the scientific basis for climate change, while pinning the blame for the rest - anything completely undeniable, even to them - on developing countries, particularly India and China. Over the past few weeks, a new figure has emerged: Naomi Seibt. Seibt, the so-called anti-Greta Thunberg, a 19-year-old from Munster in Germany, rapidly gained media attention for her call for ""climate realism"", claiming that climate change science really is not science at all, and for this reason, there is no need to panic. The young activist immediately caught the eye of the lively US denier scene and was - just months after publishing her first YouTube video - invited to speak at the high-profile Conservative Political Action Conference 2020 (CPAC) and made a member of the Heartland Institute, a thinktank known for its ties to the fossil-fuel industry.:As an academic who researches climate disinformation strategies, I found her sudden emergence very interesting. Combing through Seibst's speeches available online, I had a chance to analyse her own style of denial, coming across a number of cliched ""skeptical"" arguments that have been repeatedly debunked in the past. :Seibst at The Heartland Institute. (Spoiler: the prediction did not fail)The Heartland Institute / YoutubeWhat was perhaps most interesting, was her use of a recurrent argument on the supposed ""historical rebranding"" of climate change. The theory goes as follows: in the past, everyone used the term global warming to describe this phenomenon, but seeing that the planet was, in fact, not heating, global warming was ""rebranded"" to climate change in a sophisticated cover-up. Clearly, this hypothesis is flawed, as the Earth is unequivocally warming. Despite this, the idea appears to be widely held in the denialist scene -  to take one prominent example, Donald Trump tweeted it more than 20 times in the two years before he became president. :So, was there really a conspiracy to rebrand climate change?Even deniers used 'climate change'To find out whether there is some truth underlying the ""rebranding theory"", I analysed 30 years (1990-2019) of data containing the terms global warming and climate change from five sources: the academic literature repositories Scopus and Web of Science, the British newspapers The Times and The Guardian, and the articles published by the Heartland Institute itself. This mix of sources provides a nice overview of how the two terms have been used over time. If the theory is true, we would expect the use of global warming to be dominant in the past, to then slowly be substituted by climate change. Let's see what the data says.First, the academic literature has always preferred the more comprehensive term climate change, and there is no single point in time where articles mentioning global warming exceed those mentioning climate change on Scopus and Web of Science. Yet the gap between the two terms increases significantly after the Kyoto Protocol entered into force in 2005, a watershed year for climate governance.:Climate change is the most common term - but it's not a recent rebrand.Giulio Corsi, Author providedOn the other hand, newspapers behaved somewhat differently. In both The Guardian and The Times, climate change is generally the most common term, but the two are used interchangeably until 2005 when again we see a breaking point. Despite this, climate change was in use long before any possible rebranding. :Yet the most interesting findings come from looking at data from the Heartland Institute. In fact, the thinktank used the two terms with roughly the same frequency until 2013, when we finally see a decoupling as the use of global warming dropped while the use of climate change remained constant. This shows that ""global warming"" was widely used by climate change deniers over this 30-year period. Perhaps this is because the phrase is relatively specific, which allowed them to contrast it with simple arguments like saying that the planet cannot be warming as it's cold outside.In 2015 US senator James Inhofe brought a snowball into congress to show climate change wasn't real.Different terms, same problemLooking at the data, it is safe to say that there was no historical rebranding of climate change, as global warming was never the most commonly used term in the first place. Rather, it is evident how, over time, newspapers and academics used different phrases to represent the same phenomenon, as newspapers tended to use global warming very frequently until 2005, while this term was never common in the scientific literature. :Climate change deniers are known to often misrepresent innocuous facts and use them to their advantage, and this case was no exception: a simple evolution in language was transformed into an unfounded conspiracy theory. While the latter was easy to debunk by looking at the data, these sorts of arguments are dangerous smokescreens, designed to shift the focus of the debate away from the need for decisive measures to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Whatever we decide to call it, climate change is happening, and it calls for urgent action.Giulio Corsi, PhD Candidate, University of CambridgeThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

379,379,660.CameraObscura,"Claim:   Video clip reveals that a digital TV converter harbors a hidden camera and microphone.FALSEExamples:   [Collected via e-mail, February 2009]A popular video circulating on You Tube shows the discovery of a spy camera and a microphone hidden inside a digital TV converter box. Such devices are part of a government and industry surveillance program that is undoubtedly connected to the forced digital TV switchover being rolled out in the UK and US.""I could not believe my eyes,"" states the blurb accompanying the video clip, ""I have a friend who is kind of a conspiracy theorist. He was trying to convince me that many of the digital TV convert boxes that are coming out have microphones and cameras built into them. Knowing a bit about electronics I bought one of these devices opened it up fully intending on proving him wrong. To my surprise he was right. This device has both a miniature camera lens and what looks like a microphone. I was so shocked I took pictures and video. Please send this out to every one you know who is using one of these devices.""The camera and microphone were hidden inside a MAGNAVOX TB110 MW9 Digital to Analog Converter box.:The need to mandate a mass roll out of such hidden surveillance devices is undoubtedly one of the reasons that governments in both the UK and the US, as well as eventually the entire planet, are overseeing a forced switch over to digital TV and killing traditional analogue broad casts. The vast majority of TV's require a digital decoder box to receive digital TV transmissions.By installing covert spy devices and hidden microphones inside our all but mandatory digital boxes, the government and whatever corporate entities get a slice of the pie, have direct access to our living rooms. This is the ultimate Big Brother scenario where by the majority of Americans and Europeans will have Orwellian telescreens watching their every move.Many will dismiss such claims as conspiracy fodder, but the fact is that Americans have been spied on for decades, previously under the Echelon program and more recently as part of the Bush administration's warrantless wiretapping program.As former National Security Agency analyst Russell Tice recently revealed, ""The National Security Agency had access to all Americans' communications -- faxes, phone calls, and their computer communications,"" Tice claimed. ""It didn't matter whether you were in Kansas, in the middle of the country, and you never made foreign communications at all. They monitored all communications."":As we highlighted three years ago, private industry and eventually government is planning to use microphones in the computers of an estimated 150 million-plus Internet active Americans, as well as similar devices installed inside digital TV boxes, to spy on their life style choices and build psychological profiles which will be used for surveillance and minority report style invasive advertising and data mining.Digital cable TV boxes, such as Scientific Atlanta, have had secret in-built microphones inside them since their inception in the late 1990's and these originally dormant devices were planned to be activated when the invasive advertising revolution was being rolled out, a water shed that is quickly becoming a reality.The advent of digital video recording devices such as TiVo (Sky Plus in the UK) introduced the creation of psychological algorithm profiles -- data bases on what programs you watched, how long you watched them for, and which adverts you liked or didn't like. This information was retained by TiVo and sold to the highest bidders -- an example being Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction during the 2003 Super Bowl half-time show; TiVo were able to compile lists of how many people had rewound the clip and how many times they had replayed it.:In 2006, Google announced that they would use in-built computer microphones to listen in on user's background noise, be it television, music or radio -- and then direct advertising at them based on their preferences.In March last year, Comcast announced that they were ""experimenting with different camera technologies built into devices so it can know who's in your living room.""The cameras would use body-form recognition to confirm who was in the room and then tailor program recommendations, as well as commercials, to target that member of the family.The video below covers the issue of secret cameras installed inside digital TV boxes and their relation to the forced digital switchover. A further video explores other motives behind the digital switchover .:   Origins:   Ever since televisions first took root in American living rooms in the post-war years, conspiracy theorists have claimed that TV sets were more than just passive receivers of programming.  According to rumor, the devices were actually capable of two-way communications, a feature which allowed certain agencies (primarily government ones) to engage in all sorts of nefarious information-gathering,  everything from furtively monitoring Americans' TV viewing habits to eavesdropping on their private conversations and activities.  As televisions added more features (and the advent of cable and satellite programming typically required the use of additional converter-descrambler-receiver boxes), such rumors grew additional legs, and the upcoming government-mandated switchover to digital television (DTV) -- which will require those still using analog televisions to obtain converter boxes -- has spawned a whole new set of ""what is the government really up to?"" rumors.  The video (and accompanying explanation) cited above posits that one of the things the government is ""really up to"" in mandating the government switchover is foisting converter boxes with tiny cameras and microphones hidden inside them on the public.:Of course, the video is just a bit of prankish fun:  as photographs of a similar converter's actual circuitry show, the box in the video is simply an ordinary converter into which someone has placed an additional gadget (which, although it is claimed to be a camera/microphone pair, contains no additional circuitry for actually transmitting captured sound or images to whoever would supposedly be monitoring them, nor does the front of the box bear any obvious opening through which ordinary light could reach the camera lens unimpeded).Moreover, the video's creator, Adam Chronister, admitted to Wired's ""Threat Level"" blog that it was all a hoax concocted ""in about five minutes with a hot glue gun and parts from an old cell phone"":Chronister says the video is partially true: A friend really did share the rumor about hidden camera in the DTV converters.  ""I originally opened up the device with the intention of proving him wrong,"" says Chronister. ""At which point the thought popped in my head, wouldn't it be funny if I proved him right instead?"" ""I've seen videos go viral before, but I never thought some stupid little video I did would get popular like that,"" he says. ""I'm waiting for the Magnavox police to come and haul me off or something."":Last updated:   28 February 2009Sources:     Poulsen, Kevin.   ""Hidden Cameras in DTV Converters?

This group of migrants was falsely accused of attacking police officers, Congressman Matt Gaetz floated an unfounded conspiracy theory holding that the caravan was being funded by alt-right boogeyman George Soros, and President Trump stated (without evidence) that ""criminals and unknown Middle Easterners"" were traveling among the group.:On 23 October 2018, we came across yet another unfounded accusation of this nature. This time, a set of photographs of people burning the American flag was posted to social media along with the claim that the images featured pictured members of the caravan in the act of setting Old Glory ablaze::The illegal caravan of immigrants are flying the Honduras flag as they burn the American flag as they march towards the USA wanting asylum! They are not asylum seekers! They are invaders!None of these photographs was taken in 2018, nor do any of these images picture persons traveling with the migrant caravan. In fact, the top picture doesn't even show an American flag being burned.The photograph seen at the top was taken during an anti-Trump riot in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in May 2016. This image was used as a thumbnail for a video report about the protests by Fox News and is commonly shared as if it showed a man burning an American flag. However, the object being burned is actually a Trump banner with red and white stripes and not an U.S. flag. This difference is evident through a closer look at the upper-right corner of the image::The Trump banner burned at this protest is more clearly visible in the following video from KSAZ-TV:The second image in this collage (showing a burning flag on the ground) was taken in 2010 outside of the American Embassy in London. This photograph is available via Getty Images, where it is accompanied by the following caption::Demonstration Held Outside US Embassy Against Qur'an Burning ThreatsLONDON, ENGLAND - SEPTEMBER 11: An American flag burns outside the American Embassy, during a protest in Grosvenor Square, on September 11, 2010 in London, England.

Mr Jones has since postponed the event after sparking international condemnation and protests around the world. (Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)The final image (featuring a woman in a ""Revolution"" shirt) was taken outside of the Quicken Loans Arena in Ohio in July 2016 and shows supporters of the ""Revolutionary Communist Party, USA"" burning a U.S. flag. The incident resulted in the arrests of a dozen protesters, including Gregory ""Joey"" Johnson, who was previously arrested for burning a flag in 1984. Johnson fought those charges and his case ultimately landed in front of the U.S. Supreme Court (Texas V Johnson) in 1989. The court ruled that flag-burning constituted a form of free speech.Judge Charles Patton echoed the Supreme Court's 1989 decision when he dismissed the charges filed against Johnson in 2016::""If there is a bedrock principle underlying the first amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea without more that removes the idea from the First Amendment's protection,"" Patton wrote in dismissing charges of failure to comply, aggravated disorderly conduct and obstruction of official business. ""... In the case pending before the Court, the defendants were engaged in the expressive conduct of flag burning. As repugnant as that behavior may be to some, Texas v. Johnson makes it plain that such conduct may not be sanctioned as breaches of the peace.""None of the images featured in this social media post shows a member of the migrant caravan burning a United States flag. One of the images doesn't even feature a flag, another was taken in London, and all of them are at least two years old."

Mr. Howard claims he was involved in the ""controlled demolition"" of World Trade Center 7, the third building that was destroyed on 9/11.Mr. Howard, who worked for the CIA for 36 years as an operative, claims he was tapped by senior CIA agents to work on the project due to his engineering background, and early career in the demolition business.Trained as a civil engineer, Mr. Howard became an explosives expert after being headhunted by the CIA in early 1980s. Mr. Howard says has extensive experience in planting explosives in items as small as cigarette lighters and as large as ""80 floor buildings.""The 79-year-old New Jersey native says he worked on the CIA operation they dubbed ""New Century"" between May 1997 and September 2001, during a time he says the CIA ""was still taking orders from the top."" Mr. Howard says he was part of a cell of 4 operatives tasked with ensuring the demolition was successful.There was no truth to the story, which originated with YourNewsWire, a fake news site. As is often the case with fake news, the article lacked critical details such as when and where the confession occurred (other than the vague reference to its taking place ""at home""), YourNewsWire provide no explanation of how they alone (and no other news source) learned of this confession, and we found nothing documenting the existence of a former CIA agent named Malcom Howard outside of the just-published YourNewsWire piece.:Moreover, the article closely mimicked another fake news story published by YourNewsWire less than a month earlier, one holding that a retired MI5 agent had similarly confessed on his deathbed to assassinating Princess Diana.The conspiracy theory that WTC7 was brought down through a secret controlled demolition (thereby establishing that the 9/11 attacks were a ""false flag operation"" and/or an ""inside job"") have been comprehensively debunked, with the evidence demonstrating that fire alone caused the building's collapse."
382,382,153.NoEvidenceLisaMarieP,"On Jan. 12, 2023, news sites reported that Lisa Marie Presley, the only child of famed American musician Elvis Presley, had died. In the hours following the news, some conspiratorial Twitter users began to speculate that the cause of Presley's death at the age of 54 was a COVID-19 vaccine or booster shot.However, these rumors were completely baseless, as there was absolutely no credible evidence to support these claims.'Died Suddenly' ClaimsJust 36 minutes after The Associated Press (AP) had published on Twitter the news of Presley's death, conservative commentator Tomi Lahren tweeted, ""A lot of heartbreaking sudden deaths from heart issues lately. I wonder what it could possibly be. Perhaps we should investigate this trend...""Other Twitter users noticed the timing of Lahren's tweet and that she appeared to be referring to the news of Presley's death.:Lahren's tweet played on the ""died suddenly"" conspiracy theory, which falsely claims COVID-19 vaccines had been causing ""sudden deaths."" Other Twitter users promoted the same unsupported claim about Presley's death, too.:We debunked two rumors about the ""died suddenly"" claims in the past, as did Reuters, the AP, FactCheck.org, USA Today, PolitiFact, and AFP, just to name a few.Lisa Marie Presley's Cause of DeathAccording to AP, the only currently known details about Presley's cause of death was that she had suffered a ""full cardiac arrest"":The announcement came just hours after Priscilla Presley had confirmed that Lisa Marie Presley was rushed to the hospital earlier Thursday.Los Angeles County paramedics were dispatched to a Calabasas home at 10:37 a.m. following a report of a woman in full cardiac arrest, according to Craig Little, a spokesperson for the county's fire department. Property records indicate Presley was a resident at that address.Paramedics arrived about six minutes later, Little said. A subsequent statement from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said paramedics performed CPR and ""determined the patient had signs of life"" before taking her to a hospital in nearby West Hills immediately.:It's unclear if or when an autopsy would be completed, as this news broke less than 24 hours before we published this fact check.At least one Twitter user responded to the conspiracy theory by using a little bit of humor.The joke tweet from @TimHannan might make some readers wonder about how Elvis died.:Elvis Presley's Cause of DeathElvis died on Aug. 16, 1977. He was 42, which meant that his daughter outlived him by around 12 years.Here's how USA Today reported on the findings surrounding his death at Graceland in Memphis, Tennessee:Presley was found unresponsive at Graceland. His then-fiance Ginger Alden found Presley lying unconscious on the floor of the master suite bathroom, according to PBS. He was rushed to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 3:30 p.m.Preliminary autopsy findings determined Presley's death was the result of a ""cardiac arrhythmia"" and that drugs were not involved, said PBS. However, this was later proved not to be the complete case. In a toxicology report, weeks after his death, Elvis' blood was found to have had extremely high levels of the opiates Dilaudid, Percodan, Demerol and codeine, as well as Quaaludes. :This story will be updated if we receive any further information."

Katrina, Gustav, Isaac and Harvey all made landfall on the 29th of August.""A 29 August 2017 Facebook post by Nola McKinley containing the meme was shared almost 400,000 times within two days. The meme does not accurately state the date of first United States landfall for three of the four hurricanes it mentions. Depending on which time zone you use, the fourth date is also inaccurate.There are a number of other issues with the viral spread of this meme, including: a U.S.-centric focus on the damage done by hurricanes in the United States, while ignoring the devastation they often first cause in the Caribbean; and a spurious search for numerical patterns in the midst of tragedy.:The DatesHere are the key dates leading up to landfall for each of the four hurricanes listed in the meme. All dates refer to events timed according to UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), which is four hours ahead of Eastern time, five ahead of Central time, seven ahead of Pacific time:Katrina, 2005 (Source: National Hurricane Center)23 August - Formed as a tropical depression over the Bahamas24 August - Became Tropical Storm Katrina over the Bahamas25 August - Reached hurricane status25 August - Made landfall in Florida as a Category 1 hurricane (10.30pm UTC, 6.30pm EST)26 August - Weakened to a Tropical Storm and moved over the Gulf of Mexico, quickly regained hurricane status27 August - Strengthened to a Category 3 hurricane28 August - Strengthened to a Category 5 hurricane29 August - Weakened to a Category 3 hurricane, made second United States landfall near Buras, Louisiana (11.10am UTC, 7.10am EST):Gustav, 2008 (Source: National Hurricane Center)25 August - Formed as a tropical depression over the Caribbean, 95 miles north of the Netherland Antilles25 August - Became a tropical storm 26 August - Strengthened to a hurricane, made landfall in Haiti (6pm UTC, 2pm EST)27 August - Weakened to a tropical storm28 August - Moved over Jamaica as a tropical storm 29 August - Strengthened to a hurricane30 August - Strengthened to a hurricane, moved over the Cayman Islands as a Category 2 hurricane 30 August - Strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane, made landfall in Cuba (6pm UTC, 2pm EST)31 August - Weakened over the Gulf of Mexico1 September - made landfall near Cocodrie, Louisiana as a Category 2 hurricane (3pm UTC, 11am EST):Isaac, 2012 (Source: National Hurricane Center)21 August - Formed as a tropical depression over the Caribbean, 625 nautical miles east of the Lower Antilles, strengthened to a tropical storm22/23 August - Moved over the Leeward Islands, between Guadeloupe and Dominica, and over the Virgin Islands25 August - Made landfall in Haiti as a tropical storm (6am UTC, 2am EST)25 August - Made landfall in Cuba (3pm UTC, 11am EST)27 August - Moved over the Gulf of Mexico28 August - Strengthened to a hurricane over the Gulf of Mexico28/29 August - Made landfall at Southwest Pass on the mouth of the Mississippi River, Louisiana (12am UTC 29 August, 8pm EST 28 August)29 August - Moved back over water before making second landfall near Port Fourchon, Louisiana (8am UTC, 4am EST)Harvey, 201717 August - Low pressure disturbance in the Caribbean (3pm UTC, 11am EST)17 August - Strengthened to a tropical storm, 250 miles east of Barbados (9pm UTC, 5pm EST)19 August - Weakened to a tropical depression (9pm UTC, 5pm EST)23/24 August - Strengthened to a tropical storm (4am UTC, 12am EST, 11pm Central 23 August)24 August - Strengthened to a Category 1 hurricane (5pm UTC, 1pm EST)25 August - Strengthened to a Category 2 hurricane (5am UTC, 1am EST)25 August - Strengthened to a Category 3 hurricane (7pm UTC, 3pm EST)25 August - Strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane (11pm UTC, 7pm EST)25/26 August - Made landfall on the coast of Texas at San Jose island, just east of Rockport as a Category 4 hurricane (3am UTC 26 August, 11pm EST 25 August)26 August - Made second landfall at Copano Bay, Texas as a Category 3 hurricane (6am UTC, 2am EST)30 August - Made third landfall near Cameron, Louisiana as a Tropical Storm (9am UTC, 5am EST):So if we're looking at the first United States landfall of these four hurricanes, here's how the meme should look:: If we follow Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), only one of these four hurricanes made its first United States landfall on 29 August (Isaac in 2012). However, if we follow Eastern time, Isaac's landfall happened on 28 August, and Harvey's first landfall happened on 25 August. Either way, none of these four hurricanes shared a United States landfall date with any of the others, undermining the premise of the viral meme.Hurricanes are not one-off events that take place on a single date. They are phenomena that evolve, develop, strengthen and weaken, moving over and making landfall at various geographic locations over the course of days and weeks. That makes it easy to cherry pick dates to form a ""pattern.""The search for patterns:It's not clear whether those posting and sharing the ""8/29"" meme are simply pointing out a curious coincidence (even though, as we've shown, the dates are wrong), or suggesting that there is some conspiracy (supernatural or man-made) behind them. Let's imagine all these hurricanes did make their first United States landfall on 29 August. What would that mean?Firstly, it would not necessarily be particularly strange. Late August and early September is peak hurricane season in the Atlantic. While all four highlighted hurricanes did not make their first U.S. landfall on the same date, they did each occur within the same eight-day period, between 25 August and 1 September. Secondly, it would not be an example of government geoengineering or climate engineering. Conspiracy theorists have already claimed that Hurricane Harvey is ""the latest example of covert weather warfare being waged on completely unsuspecting populations...orchestrated and manipulated by an ever more desperate and aggressive global power structure."":And some have claimed that the ""8/29"" date pattern in the meme is a clear sign of sinister government orchestration. Setting aside the fact that the dates are wrong, it is unclear why the U.S. government would choose to schedule the United States landfall of four hurricanes for the same calendar date across 12 years, or how this would even be possible. If the supposed purpose of climate engineering is to wage ""weather warfare"" against ""unsuspecting populations,"" why would the purported conspirators continuously choose the same date? ConclusionThere is a pattern behind the dates of these four hurricanes - they all made their first United States landfall within an eight-day period, in different years. But this has a very simple and boring explanation: 25 August-1 September is part of peak hurricane season in the Atlantic. Any interpretation of hurricane dates that goes beyond this is entirely spurious, requiring as it does ludicrous government conspiracy theories or supernatural predetermination. However, the desire to find numerical patterns and explanations in the midst of terrible human tragedy, such as that brought by Hurricane Harvey, is a very understandable one. :We saw similar spurious memes about the dates of terrorist attacks in the aftermath of the 22nd May 2017 suicide bombing at an arena in Manchester, England. Faced with the horror of dozens of children being slaughtered at a pop concert, many found comfort or distraction in pointing out a supposed pattern of terrorist attacks on the 22nd day of various months. In reality, a terrorist attack is no more likely to happen on the 22nd than any other day of the month. "
384,384,127.MalaysiaFlight370Pho,"Claim:   A passenger on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 hid his cell phone in his rectum and used it to post a picture to the Internet after the flight was hijacked and its passengers imprisoned.FALSEExample:   [Collected via e-mail, April 2014]This image, which appears black was posted as taken in a dark cell by an IBM engineer. The picture is black because the cell was too dark, but a critical piece of information was embedded in the Exif data, the coordinates to Diego Garcia, where the picture was taken. And it's real, this is NOT a hoax. The coordinates in the picture indicate that the photo was taken within 3 miles of what Google officially gives for Diego Garcia. The picture posted with the following text: ""I have been held hostage by unknown military personal after my flight was hijacked (blindfolded). I work for IBM and I have managed to hide my cellphone in my ass during the hijack. I have been separated from the rest of the passengers and I am in a cell. My name is Philip Wood. I think I have been drugged as well and cannot think clearly."":   Origins:   Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared over the South China Sea on 8 March 2014 with 239 persons (227 passengers and 12 crew members) aboard.  The item reproduced above is one of multiple conspiracy theory postings that have appeared in the weeks since suggesting that the flight was somehow hijacked or diverted to a highly-secretive U.S. military base located on the Diego Garcia atoll in the Indian Ocean.This version of the conspiracy theory posits that an IBM employee Philip Wood, who was the only American passenger on Flight 370, implausibly managed to hide his cell phone up his rectum throughout the flight's hijacking and his subsequent drugging and imprisonment at a secret military location, then took a photograph and posted it to the Internet to document this chain of events.Of course, the fact that the photograph is completely black (supposedly because it was taken inside a dark cell) and therefore shows and documents absolutely nothing hasn't slowed conspiracy theorists, who insist that the photo's Exif data shows it to have been taken on 18 March 2014 in the area of Diego Garcia and therefore its implausible backstory must be true (even though Exif data can be manipulated).:One of the primary sites promulgating this conspiracy theory, Jim Stone Freelance Journalist, acknowledged that the photograph originated with 4chan, the home of a multiplicity of hoaxes perpetuated by its anonymous denizens:This got posted to 4chan and was pulled immediately, but 4plebs, an independently run backup of 4chan which is NOT controlled has the original on archive, and the date of posting matches the photo. This answers the question why the photo only surfaced recently. Someone surfing archives found it.What these conspiracy buffs would have us believe is, therefore, that a commercial flight was furtively hijacked by the military and its passengers held captive at a secret location, that one of those passengers nonetheless managed to hide his cell phone up his rear end for ten days (apparently his military captors missed the day of training where they explained about searching prisoners), used his phone to take a photograph in the darkness that documents absolutely nothing, then with one chance to let the outside world know of his plight, he anonymously posted his unrevealing photo to a site where it would be least likely to be taken seriously, the ""Politically Incorrect"" (/pol/) section of 4chan, and this supposedly earth-shattering revelation has attracted no interest whatsoever by investigative agencies or news media or anyone else outside of a handful of sites devoted to wild conspiracy theories.   :Sometimes a joke is just a joke.Last updated:   4 April 2014"
385,385,119.DidaPlannedCongressi,"Claim:In January 2019, a planned congressional delegation to visit Belgium, Egypt and Afghanistan included 93 family relatives of Congress members.Rating:UnprovenAbout this rating In January 2019, in the midst of the longest-ever federal government shutdown, President Donald Trump and Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi became embroiled in a high-profile dispute. On 16 January, Pelosi wrote to Trump suggesting that the president postpone his State of the Union address on the grounds that it was a designated ""National Special Security Event,"" and the U.S. Secret Service had by then not been funded for 26 days. :A day later, President Trump responded, informing Pelosi that he was postponing a planned congressional delegation trip to visit American troops in Belgium, Egypt and Afghanistan -- an excursion Pelosi had carefully planned and intended to lead, in the company of several other members of the U.S. Congress. Trump wrote:""In light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I am sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate. I also feel that, during this period, it would be better if you were in Washington negotiating with me and joining the strong border security movement to end the shutdown.""Although the congressional delegation could use commercial flights rather than U.S. military aircraft, Pelosi cancelled the excursion, claiming that President Trump's public announcement of the until-then secret plans had created an insurmountable security risk for the delegation. Against this background, a rumor emerged online that attempted to discredit and undermine the motives and activities of Pelosi, who has been a frequent target of junk news and misinformation.:On 19 January, the ""Marshall Report,"" a blog that specializes in junk news and right-leaning conspiracy theories, claimed the group that had intended to visit Belgium, Egypt and Afghanistan included dozens of Pelosi's own family members.The blog post carried the headline ""Pelosi's secret overseas mission included 93 family members. Why?"" and speculated that Pelosi was leading a conspiracy to facilitate a terrorist assassination of President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, thus paving the way for her own elevation to the White House. (The speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives is second in the line of succession to the U.S. presidency, after the vice president.)Why did Pelosis [sic] have all of her children and grandchildren - 93 family members going with her on her trip to Egypt, Afghanistan and Brussells? And 7 congress members? Who takes 93 family members (mostly children) on a secret government business trip on military aircraft, paid for by tax payer dollars?......Was Pelosis [sic] planning for the Jihadist Attack that was intercepted by the FBI a day or so ago, in Georgia to be successful? Remember he had rockets. And or was the Georgia arrest a first step leading into an upcoming false flag? Was it planned to take place while POTUS and V-P were together in the Oval Office or in one of the several buildings that were earmarked?:Pelosi is Third in Line of Succession, so if POTUS and V-P were both killed, (GOD FORBID) she would be the next President. Being out of the states (good alibi) the news would coordinate their talking points and gasp as they report how fortunate America is that Pelosi was not in DC! They would make up something like, ""If she hadn't been working overseas she would have been in that meeting and killed too"".  All media would have the same talking points that would be jumbled up and leading to the findings that the Georgia Jihadist was not working alone as they had thought. It was a big operation with several sleeper cells. The next question is -why would she be going to Brussels, Egypt and Afghanistan? Was she going to meet her deep state handlers in Brussels for her globalization instructions? Was she negotiating a new batch of mercenary's from the Muslim brotherhood in Egypt? Was she checking on deep state ""Poppy Bush's"" CIA opium lab in Afghanistan?  Maybe she was carrying out some diabolical scheme for the UN and NATO?  Who knows?In support of the claim that Pelosi had intended to travel with 93 of her family members, the ""Marshall Report"" cited a series of tweets published on 18 January by the @BLUEPRINT_Q account. That Twitter account frequently publishes material related to the discredited ""QAnon"" conspiracy theory.:In this instance, @BLUEPRINT_Q was outlining a theory that claimed the 2018/19 federal government shutdown was actually part of a plot by President Trump to fight back against supposed ""deep state"" forces opposing him from within the federal government, by furloughing certain categories of government workers until he can (purportedly) fire them legally. As part of that theory, @BLUEPRINT_Q claimed that the planned congressional delegation excursion was not for the stated purpose of visiting U.S. military personnel stationed abroad, but rather was linked to the European Union, the Muslim Brotherhood and heroin trafficking. @BLUEPRINT_Q claimed that all of Speaker Pelosi's children and grandchildren were ""booked"" to take part in the trip, along with six other members of Congress and ""93 family members.""10. Yesterday, @POTUS grounded @SpeakerPelosi's ""NATO"" trips to: Brussels (EU HQ), Egypt (Muslim Brotherhood HQ), Afghanistan (#Heroin HQ). ALL Pelosi's children and grandchildren were also booked, totaling 7 congressman and 93 family members grounded.https://t.co/Ua5o32BLQQ-- BLUEPRINT (@BLUEPRINT_Q) January 18, 2019: It's clear that @BLUEPRINT_Q did not intend to claim that the delegation included 93 of only Pelosi's family members, but rather 93 relatives of the seven members of Congress. This is because @BLUEPRINT_Q cited as evidence for the involvement of family members another series of tweets published by another Twitter account that also frequently and enthusiastically promotes various strands of the QAnon conspiracy theory. Earlier on 18 January, @5Strat posted a conspiracy theory that claimed the purpose of the congressional delegation excursion was, in fact, to plot the ""demise"" of President Trump with NATO:1) The Nancy Pelosi 7 day trip to Europe was in essence Nancy and 6 Angry Democrats going to meet with angry NATO (angry at having to pay their fair share) to plot the demise of @realDonaldTrump . Why should POTUS authorize the Air Force to transport a mission of Sedition?-- John 'In the Desert' Salisbury (@5Strat) January 18, 2019: The original source of the ""family trip"" theory specified that 93 was the number of relatives of all seven members of Congress, and not of Pelosi alone, writing ""it wasn't just 7 angry Democrats. It was their extended families too, 93 of them."" 3) Isn't it interesting that Nancy Pelosi had ALL her Children and ALL her Grandchildren booked on that flight?If I didn't know any better I'd say someone might have been running...-- John 'In the Desert' Salisbury (@5Strat) January 18, 2019 :@5Strat did not provide any source or evidence in support of these claims, although they did cryptically allude to a purported need for secrecy about their purported sources, and claimed to have submitted a federal Freedom of Information request for details relating to the delegation. @5Strat, the original source of that claim, has a history of posting outlandish and bizarre conspiracy theories, especially the discredited QAnon conspiracy theory. In fact, the claim that the delegation included 93 family relatives of members of Congress was part of a conspiracy theory that alleged Pelosi and six Congressional Democrats had intended to travel abroad as part of a NATO plot to assassinate President Trump and Vice President Pence, and install Pelosi in the White House. The same Twitter account has written that ""Extraterrestrials have enslaved this World since the dawn of time,"" and recently endorsed a numerology-linked conspiracy theory that holds that the dates of various events in President Trump's life -- most recently, a ""blood moon"" on the two-year anniversary of his inauguration -- prove that he was chosen by God to lead the United States.:On 19 January 2019, Fred Doucette, a Republican member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives and a co-chair of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential election campaign, promoted the ""93 family members"" claim and implied that the planned excursion had nefarious and hidden purposes:What Americans don't know@realDonaldTrump grounded @SpeakerPelosi ""NATO"" trips to: Brussels (EU HQ), Egypt (Muslim Brotherhood HQ), Afghanistan (#Heroin HQ) ""ALL"" Pelosi's children and grandchildren were also booked, totaling 7 congressman and 93 family members #FamilyOuting pic.twitter.com/0QjaVRAuc2-- Representative Fred Doucette (@FredDoucetteNH) January 19, 2019We requested comment from all seven Congressional members of the cancelled delegation: House Speaker Pelosi and U.S. Reps.

386,386,354.HasTonyPodestaBeenAr,"Claim:Lobbyist Tony Podesta has been arrested by United States Marshals in relation to Special Counsel Bob Mueller's Russia probe.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 5 November 2017, two notorious fake news sites -- Neon Nettle and YourNewsWire -- posted stories falsely reporting that Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta has been arrested in relations to an investigation being conducted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and is in the custody of the U.S Marshal Service::Democrat lobbyist Tony Podesta is in police custody after being arrested last night, with arrest warrants also issued for Hillary Clinton and John Podesta, who are ""turning themselves in"" on Monday morning.In a shocking turn of events, three key Democrats have been indicted, yet there's a total mainstream media blackout.Arrests records confirm that 74-year-old Anthony, founder of the Podesta Group, brother of John Podesta, and a major player in the Pizzagate scandal, was arrested last night.Just days ago, Tony Podesta stepped down from the Podesta Group after probing conducted under the authority of special counsel Robert Mueller led to an investigation by the Justice Department.Tony is currently in custody with the US Marshals with the Podesta brothers' lawyers pleading with Mueller to keep the indictments sealed.Since May 2017, Mueller has been leading a Department of Justice investigation in a wide-ranging probe into allegations of collusion between President Donald Trump, his associates and the Russian government. As of 7 November 2017, there is no evidence that Tony Podesta (the brother of Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign chair, John Podesta) has been taken into custody. He is not named on the list of publicly-filed charges by Mueller's office, and he has not been officially accused of wrongdoing.:His lobbying company Podesta Group made headlines after the first indictments from Mueller's investigation were made public, resulting in the arrests of former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates. In the indictment, the firm is not named but is referred to as ""Company B"", according to media reports. Another lobbying firm, Mercury Public Affairs, was identified in the indictment as ""Company A."" Manafort and Gates hired both companies to lobby on behalf of Ukraine's ousted pro-Kremlin president Viktor Yanukovych and his political party, paying them millions from accounts held offshore: At the direction of MANAFORT and GATES, Company A and Company B engaged in extensive lobbying. Among other things, they lobbied multiple Members of Congress and their staffs about Ukraine sanctions, the validity of Ukraine elections, and the propriety of Yanukovych's imprisoning his presidential rival, Yulia Tymoshenko (who had served as Ukraine President prior to Yanukovych). In the aftermath of the arrests and swirl of speculation and news coverage, Podesta stepped down from his position with the company he founded in 1988 the day the indictments were unsealed, on 30 October 2017.:Stories posted by Neon Nettle and YourNewsWire often go viral, even though the content they post is almost always completely fabricated and conspiratorial. YourNewsWire also spread far and wide concocted and false claims that there was a second shooter in the 1 October 2017 massacre in Las Vegas. (Authorities have concluded there was only one.)YourNewsWire also promoted Pizzagate, a wholly debunked and bizarre conspiracy theory alleging that Democrat politicians were covering up a massive pedophile ring being run out of a Washington D.C. pizza parlor. Neon Nettle took that story a step further by reporting falsely that deceased rock stars Chester Bennington and Chris Cornell were murdered because they were about to reveal names of people participating in the fictional pedophile ring. Both Cornell and Bennington, singers for the bands Soundgarden and Linkin Park respectively, committed suicide and were not murdered, according to their local coroners' offices."

388,388,526.TheMythsBehindtheTat,"This article about 'QAnon Shaman' Jake Angeli is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.The defining image of the storming of the US Capitol on January 6 was undoubtedly that of a bare-chested man posing resplendent in a horned fur hat and face paint. Images of him in his weird costume have been shared across the globe - he seems to perfectly encapsulate the absurdity of the mob takeover of America's sacred seat of power. The individual in question has since been identified in the media as a far-right activist from Arizona by the name of Jacob Chansley (also known as Jake Angeli). He was quickly alleged to be an adherent of the QAnon conspiracy theory - though not before fake rumours spread that he was actually an antifa ""plant"".One thing that should make it very clear where Angeli's politics lie are his tattoos. On his torso he has a large Thor's hammer, known as Mjolnir, and what appears to be an image of the Norse world tree, Yggdrasill. :The 'Mjolnir': a hammer wielded by Thor, the Norse god of thunder.Carsten Musch via ShutterstockMjolnir is one symbol we can be pretty sure was used by the original adherents of the Norse belief system, perhaps to summon the protection of the god Thor. Yggdrasill is the giant ash tree that supports the Norse cosmos, its branches reaching into sky realms inaccessible to humans, and its roots to the subterranean realm of the dead. Unlike Thor's hammer, it was only rarely depicted by the Vikings, and representations such as the one below are modern interpretations.  :The 'Yggdrasil' or Tree of Life, from Norse mythology has been co-opted by some far-right groups.Marco Klaue via Shutterstock.Above these tattoos with a central place in Norse mythology is one that is more contentious. It depicts a valknut - an image that appears on two Viking-Age stones from Sweden carved with scenes from Norse mythology, including the Stora Hammars I stone on the island of Gotland.The symbol's original meaning is unclear, but it appears in close proximity to the father of the gods, Odin, on the stones. As Odin is closely connected with the gathering of fallen warriors to Valhalla, the valknut may be a symbol of death in battle.The Norse 'Valknut' symbol is usually linked to the god Odin and may refer to the glory of death in battle.Anne Mathiasz via ShutterstockSnorri Sturluson, a medieval Icelandic collector of myths, tells us in his ""Language of Poetry"" that a famous giant called Hrungnir had a stone heart ""pointed with three corners"", and so the valknut is sometimes also called ""Hrungnir's Heart"". Whatever its original meaning, it has been used in more recent times by various neo-pagan groups - and increasingly by some white supremacists as a coded message of their belief in violent struggle.:Borrowed symbolsAngeli claims that he wears his bizarre costume to draw attention to himself - but there's surely another reason for the bare chest and precariously low-slung pants. He is displaying these tattoos to full effect, and wants them to be seen.Many people have similar tattoos which express their neo-pagan belief, Scandinavian heritage, or interest in the myths. But there is no doubt that these symbols have also been co-opted by a growing far-right movement. A hint at where Angeli lies on this continuum is in a tattoo that is less visible on his left shoulder, but which several academics including archaeologist Kevin Philbrook Smith have pointed out seems to be a version of the Sonnenrad, or sun-wheel. The Norse 'Sonnenrad' or sun-wheel, widely co-opted by far-right groups.robin.ph via ShutterstockThis is a symbol listed by the Anti-Defamation League as ""one of a number of ancient European symbols appropriated by the Nazis in their attempt to invent an idealised Aryan or Norse heritage"". Often it contains a swastika or other hate symbol - but worn with nothing inside, it is very easy for other white supremacists to fill in the blank.:Dog whistlesThere is, of course, a long history of the co-opting of Norse imagery by the far right. Beloved of Himmler, the runic script inspired the insignia of the SS, while the swastika is another of those ""ancient European symbols"" that features in various forms on picture stones and runic inscriptions. This misappropriation continued after the fall of the Third Reich, though in a more muted form. Neo-Nazis - at least those not brazen enough to wear a swastika - tend to opt for less recognisable symbols. These include numbers representing ""Heil Hitler"" (88 - H is the eighth letter of the alphabet) or ""Aryan Brotherhood"" (12 - letters one and two). Far-right adherents also favour other characters from the Germanic runic writing system which communicate similar messages. Othala: an Old Scandinavian runic symbol referring to 'inherited land' that is often used by far-right groups.Nattasid Thapsang via ShutterstockOne of these is the Othala runic letter - its name means ""inherited land"", and so it frequently appears in the emblems of white nationalist groups from Ukraine to the US.:These ""coded"" symbols, and others newly borrowed from Norse myth, are even harder to spot and condemn. Sky recently cancelled a reality TV show after viewers complained one contestant was covered in tattoos - including on his face - that could be seen as having far-right connotations. But if certain symbols are hard for the general public to spot, they are certainly dog whistles to members of an increasingly global white supremacist movement who know exactly what they mean. :Many scholars argue that the best way to counter far-right misuse is to drown it out with positive and accurate representations of Norse myth - the position I took in my recent retelling. But in the wake of the mass shooting in Norway in 2011 by Anders Breivik, who named his guns after weapons of the Norse gods, as well as the 2019 Christchurch mass shooter Brenton Tarrant, with his allusions to Valhalla, and of this latest poster-boy of far-right insurrection, we have to think very hard about whether this is the right approach to counter a truly global extremist movement. At the very least, academics - and anyone else with a genuine interest in Norse mythology - need to be far more involved in countering these abuses of our subject on the ground. Otherwise, we run the risk of ceding the field to those who see the vague concept of ""Norse heritage"" as a way to further unite an international fraternity of violent white supremacists.:Tom Birkett, Lecturer in Old English, University College CorkThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Several social media users questioned whether the post was real.Screenshots supposedly showing tweets written by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Halyna Hutchins, a cinematographer killed by a prop gun misfire shot by actor Alec Baldwin, made the same claim -- verbatim -- after their deaths.Also, the Twitter handle shown in the image above (@ShinzoAbe) was not the handle for Abe's official Twitter account (@AbeShinzo).Although the entire Clinton family is a favorite target of conspiracy theorists, Hillary Clinton became a prominent obsession among them when she launched a presidential campaign against Donald Trump in 2016, and after she lost that race.Abe was assassinated while delivering a speech in the Japanese city of Nara. He served as Japan's prime minister from 2012 to 2020."

391,391,43.ConspiracyTheoriesSp,"A week after a mass shooting turned an outdoor country music festival into the site of a massacre, Las Vegas was a city mourning, and its iconic Strip a crime scene. Before many of the dead were even identified, a now all-too-familiar network of conspiracy peddlers had pounced.Police say Stephen Paddock, 64, used the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino as a vantage point from which he rained automatic gunfire down on the Route 91 Harvest Festival crowd of 22,000 below. In what would be the worst mass shooting in modern United States history on 1 October 2017, 58 people lost their lives and hundreds more were injured. Hauntingly, when we visited the Strip the following weekend, bouquets still lay around the festival grounds, marking the spots where people had collapsed while trying to flee. :The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, the law enforcement agency leading a contingency of organizations (including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) on the investigation, has reiterated on multiple occasions that they have no evidence suggesting there was a second shooter during the killing spree. Nevertheless, a week after the shooting, the conspiracy theory had gained such prominence that the majority of people we approached had doubts about law enforcement's investigative findings. An LVMPD spokesman told us:I think it's fair to say the investigation began immediately after the incident occurred -- we had officers on scene and after a sweep of the hotel there was no indication there was another person shooting from another room. There was no indication there was another shooter inside the room either. We're not into rumors we are into facts, and although we are taking all tips, we have to vet that information and pursue the most credible information.Las Vegas resident Alexis Axelrod, 39, said she thinks much of the rumor is coming from people frustrated  by a lack of answers in an investigation that has, so far, produced no discernible motive for the shooting. Standing by a cluster of votive candles and flowers near the entrance of Mandalay Bay, she told us::People don't have answers and they're just looking to fill the blank. It's easier to say ""terrorism"" than the guy was crazy, or we simply just don't know why he did it.I would say [the police] are doing an excellent job. Obviously they can't tell us everything at once because it's an active, open case but I'm sure there will be more information forthcoming as time goes on.However, there was no shortage of false information in the immediate aftermath, produced cheaply and quickly and disseminated instantly and widely. Internet users on the message board 4chan quickly identified the wrong man as the shooter, resulting in that man receiving death threats. Career conspiracy theorist Alex Jones weighed in with the ""false flag"" narrative that the shooter was a ""patsy"" and the attack would be used as pretense ""to kick off the left's war with the right."" YourNewsWire.com latched on with rapid-fire stories, two of which claimed they had video ""confirmation"" that there had been multiple gunmen (both videos have already been debunked.) Sandy Hook ""truthers"", meanwhile, began looking for evidence that the Las Vegas victims and their relatives were ""crisis actors"" in yet another staged mass shooting.:Minutes before we spoke to Axelrod, we encountered a young man in front of the Mandalay Bay hotel who explained his take on the shooting. There was more than one shooter, and the government is covering it up, he told us. Why? Alluding to a related conspiracy theory about the United Nations Small Arms Treaty, he said this was yet another gun-related catastrophe engineered by the United States government in service of the New World Order, a ubiquitous conspiracy theory (which has anti-Semitic roots) that posits a powerful cabal is angling to take Americans' guns away in order to seize control and establish an autocratic global government.Earlier that day, a Las Vegas resident we spoke to expressed doubts about law enforcement's findings, not because she was invested in a specific conspiracy theory but because the false narrative had simply saturated the Internet to the point she kept encountering it. When we asked where she got her information, she pulled out her phone and opened Facebook, scrolling to a debunked YourNewsWire story with the headline: ""Las Vegas: Video Footage Confirms Multiple Shooters, Co-ordinated Attack."" The story has been shared hundreds of thousands of times. She also pointed out a link to Alex Jones's InfoWars, noting she didn't know who he was.:Kathryn Olmsted, history professor at University of California at Davis and an author and expert on conspiracy theories, told us the faster news travels, the faster false information travels as well:You see that again and again throughout history, particularity since the early 20th century, with news traveling so quickly. A lot of people, when they hear about a traumatic event, want to understand it. It can be somehow more reassuring to believe there is an evil group of people in charge rather than no one is in charge, and what happened was totally random. Psychologists would argue there's a certain psychological function served by claiming it wasn't just a random act, but in fact the Las Vegas attack was part of a big plan.It's really terrifying to live in a world where that sort of thing just happens, and so people try and come up with theories that explain them. All of the recent horrific mass shootings have been accused of being false flags by the far right conspiracy theorists -- [InfoWars host] Alex Jones has made a career out of this now.To me it seems quite obvious that the Internet and particularly social media is driving the increase in these theories. Now you don't have the gate keepers any more, and people are able to share these stories directly with their friends on Facebook.:(A ""false flag"" is conspiracy slang for a disaster engineered by the government with the goal of achieving greater surveillance or security powers. It is an extremely popular explanation for mass shootings, resulting in widespread harassment of victims or their loved ones.)Marilyn Mayo, senior research fellow for the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, told us the conspiracy theories after Las Vegas have been exacerbated by the fact that unlike previous mass shootings, no obvious explanation has been presented:Because of the way it was carried out, where we don't yet know of any specific ties to any particular group or ideology even, there's this sense that people can fill in the gap by coming up with their own theories.I think what happens for these people who create conspiracy theories is they actually believe them but they don't think about the consequences of what they're saying.The conspiracy theory about the second shooter or multiple shooters partially came from civilians listening to law enforcement radio traffic and taking what they heard at face value -- many people we interviewed had been listening to their scanners and said they heard police discussing other possible active shooters. This, they believed, was evidence that Paddock was not alone in his actions that night.:But that is a mistaken assumption, said Bill Flores, a retired assistant sheriff with the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. It's not unusual, in the panic of an unfolding deadly situation, for the public to call in reports of what they see and hear, and dispatchers have to relay those. Then the officers on scene have to determine whether it's true or not:In this type of situation where the active shooter is still shooting when the officers arrive, not only do the officers have to consider the possibility of s second shooter but they also have to take care of their own safety as well as the safety of others around them. There's a whole lot of things that a responding officer has to weigh and consider. They also have an active investigation going on right now even thought the perpetrator's dead.It's clear in the radio traffic and body camera footage that arriving officers were at first both unaware of where the shooting was coming from, but also were unsure how many attackers there were. During an interview with the CBS news program ""60 Minutes,"" Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sgt. Joshua Bitsko, who along with three others formed an impromptu strike team to take on the shooter, said::We're told that security is taking fire from a suspect on the 29th floor. And that we had other officers that were identifying the suspect was in a room on the 32nd floor. So we're thinking multiple shooters at this point.When police initially arrived, they thought there was a shooter was inside the festival grounds, and at another point they thought shots were coming from one of the gates. Later an officer says she couldn't tell if the shots were coming from Mandalay Bay or the neighboring Luxor hotel. It's clear they were dealing with multiple gunshot victims, coordinating medical aid and trying to shut down streets around the area to prevent further casualties. At one point, an officer informs dispatch:We're making tourniquets out of blankets but I'm running out of blankets here.Within minutes, however, an officer radioed that he was on the 31st floor and heard gunfire coming from the floor above. Later, they identified the room the shooter was in: Room 135 on floor 32. When they breached the door they found only Paddock's body inside.:Tricia Garelts, the wife of an LVMPD officer and member of Police Wives of America, was standing near a large memorial of 58 crosses, balloons and flowers near the iconic ""Welcome to Las Vegas"" sign when we interviewed her, handing out water bottles and wearing a T-shirt that read ""Overcome Evil."":She told us it was a mistake to interpret radio traffic as evidence for multiple shooters, because the night was deadly chaos; people were running for their lives and first responders were working against time to stop the shooting and get the wounded to hospitals:I truly believe if I was a citizen out there and heard different random noises in that situation, it would be easily to perceive that some other situation [than what was actually happening] was going on.The misinformation being spread, she said, is only causing more fear and anxiety. Of the conspiracy peddlers, she said angrily:Where were they when [first responders] were out there saving lives? They weren't out there.Although it may be too early to say whether loved ones of Las Vegas victims will be harassed to the extent that the families of victims in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting have been, Ryan Graney, who represents the family of Victoria Soto -- a teacher who died trying to protect her students -- said five years later, Internet characters are still on a crusade to prove Soto was not really murdered and the shooting was a ""false flag""::I don't know what's missing in their brains, like the empathy center maybe. They think they're so right, and the government is so out to get them that it's OK for them to harass these families.I'm tired of dealing with these people, but I have to -- I help the Sotos, but other families don't have that barrier, and the moms and dads have to read these comments.These people sit around on their computers and trash talk [victims and their families] and come up with their batshit crazy theories. And they think they're right."

County officials say a typo on the official search warrant lead law enforcement officers to the wrong location, a warehouse in Casa Grande, where, instead of a methamphetamine operation, they found a Boeing 777 commercial airliner and a sedan.""Upon entering the premises, Pinal County Sheriff's deputies observed a large commercial airliner parked in the center of the warehouse,"" Pinal County's Chief Investigator Adam Hutch told reporters. ""The aircraft in question is white, with a gray underbelly and features red and blue stripes down the middle of fuselage."" Hutch said the plane's tail prominently displays the all-too-familiar red and blue logo of Malaysian Airlines. Additionally, its registration number, 9M-MRO, matches that of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 which is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean on March 8, 2014.:During CNN's The Situation Room Tuesday, Wolf Blitzer was pointedly asked by a guest what his thoughts on the aircraft were. Mr. Blitzer blinked several times while staring into the camera before saying, ""I'm sorry, could you repeat that? We seem to be having some issues with the mic."" Blitzer, citing ""technical difficulties,"" began to tap on his earpiece before removing it entirely to inspect it. He began to blow on the earpiece, presumably to remove dust or hardened ear wax, as the segment cut to an unusually long commercial break.While the article was nothing more than fake news positioned as an obvious jab at CNN's wall-to-wall coverage of the 8 March 2014 disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, a steady stream of perplexed tweets revealed that the joke sailed over many readers' heads. Perhaps, in part, because Real News Right Now does not feature a disclaimer identifying it as a fake news web site (which is common amongst similar sites in the ""satire"" genre), further confusing new visitors about the nature of its articles. In addition to the site's outlandish content, Real News Right Now's ""About"" page states that author R.

This has given rise to fevered and baseless reports about ""FEMA camps,"" disposable coffins, enforced vaccinations, and the related ""Jade Helm"" conspiracy theory.:In June 2018, adherents continued this tradition with groundless claims about ""FEMA barges,"" alleging that the federal government was taking advantage of a volcanic eruption in Hawaii to incarcerate civilians in an ""internment camp."" On 7 June 2018, the web site SomeonesBones.com -- which promotes the extraterrestrial Nibiru and Anunnaki conspiracy theories -- wrote:A flotilla of FEMA barges, each able to hold 2,000 people in cramped conditions, set sail from a secret staging area near San Diego and is currently en route to Hawaii, says a FEMA employee speaking under condition of anonymity. The vessels, he said, departed California on June 5 and, travelling at a speed of 20 knots, will arrive in Hawaii on the eleventh. Rather than berth at Port Allen or Hiwo Harbor, the ships will drop anchor ten miles offshore and use powerboats to ferry displaced persons to one of three FEMA housing ships.But FEMA is on no mission of mercy; anyone escorted onto a FEMA barge will be incarcerated and transported to a mainland FEMA internment camp in Region IX. There, they will be held captive by a controversial agency with a long history of imprisoning people against their will.:To illustrate this false report, SomeonesBones.com used three images taken out of their proper context. The first does in fact show a FEMA barge, but the photograph was taken in 2017 and shows a vessel deployed by FEMA to provide temporary accommodation to victims of Hurricane Harvey in Texas. The original photograph can be seen in news reports at that time.  The second image is actually a photograph of the Vernon C. Bain Correctional Center, a prison barge used by the New York City Department of Corrections, which is anchored near the Bronx. The original photograph can be found here. The third image used out of context was actually taken in 2013, not June 2018. It shows a barge docked at Treasure Island in San Francisco. You can see the original photograph here. Beyond the fact that SomeonesBones.com has a history of publishing wildly untrue conspiracy theories and misleadingly used unrelated photographs in the context of its story, we could find no corroboration whatsoever for the claim that FEMA plans to even send barges to temporarily house victims of the Kilauea volcanic eruption.:The claim that FEMA plans to use the barges as transport to an ""internment camp"" is no more than the latest in a long line of groundless conspiracy theories about the agency.

The post featured a photograph from the Lviv pogroms (consecutive massacres of Polish Jews in 1941) showing a terrified Jewish woman dressed only in her undergarments fleeing from pursuers armed with clubs. That image was accompanied with the following statement:Jews were beaten in the streets, not by Nazi soldiers but by their neighbors ... even by children.""Because history is edited, most people today don't realize that to get to the point where Nazi soldiers could easily round up thousands of Jews, the government first made their own neighbors hate them simply for being Jews. How is that any different from hating someone for their political views."":Other controversial posts were shared via Carano's account as well, such as a photograph of a person whose head was covered with several cloth masks accompanied by the legend ""Meanwhile in California,"" a post stating that ""Expecting everyone you encounter to agree with every belief or view you hold is f--ing wild,"" and a third that invoked a prominent conspiracy theory in declaring ""Jeff Epstein didn't kill himself.""Many Twitter users reacted to Carano's contentious posts by using the hashtag #FireGinaCarano and tagging accounts for Disney, Disney+, ""Star Wars,"" and Lucasfilm to demand that Carano be fired from the cast of ""The Mandalorian."":As the entertainment trade publication Variety noted, ""Carano has courted social media controversy before"":[Carano] previously shar[ed] misinformation about mask wearing and voter fraud. In November 2020, she made light of people including their preferred pronouns on social media by adding ""beep/bop/boop"" to her Twitter bio, which many fans called out as transphobic.

395,395,545.EXCLUSIVEExpandingPr,"The Epoch Times was founded by Chinese-American adherents to a spiritual movement and meditation practice known as Falun Gong. That news outlet has in recent years, as reported by BuzzFeed News and NBC News, transformed into a misinformation-laden, pro-Trump mouthpiece. After Facebook banned The Epoch Times from buying ads on that social media network in the summer of 2019, several ""sock-puppet pages"" popped up promoting Epoch Times content without disclosure. Facebook banned these pages from ad buys as well in August, following NBC News' follow-up reporting.Here, Snopes reports on a pro-Trump media network whose reach is rapidly expanding on Facebook and is linked in multiple ways to The Epoch Times. This outlet, which goes by the name The BL (The Beauty of Life) and first appeared around 2016, is a large international operation. It has a prodigious social media presence on Facebook that can be linked to at least 82 Facebook groups and pages representing a total of over 28 million followers. The site has spent at least $510,698 on Facebook ad buys with pro-Trump content and other promotions. Its staff members also appear to be cultivating several Trump-specific Facebook pages and groups and covertly administering them under the umbrella of The BL, in most cases without disclosure.:Despite the fact that the CEO of the company that owns The BL was once the CEO of Epoch Times Vietnam, and despite the fact that The BL's editor-in-chief is a former editor-in-chief of The Epoch Times English language edition, an unnamed representative of The BL told us by email that ""The BL has NO connection with The Epoch Times."" Similarly, The Epoch Times' publisher, Stephen Gregory, told us by email that ""The Epoch Times is not affiliated with the BL."" Such statements, we believe, are not reflective of reality.The Falun Gong Media EmpireThe Epoch Times was founded in 2000 by followers of the Falun Gong movement. Falun Gong, according to its adherents, is ""an ancient ... way for improving mind and body"" which includes meditation and other exercises along with spiritual teachings. ""At the core of these teachings are the values of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance,"" a post by the non-profit Friends of Falun Gong stated. However, the Wall Street Journal reported that ""Beijing declared Falun Gong an evil cult and launched a brutal crackdown on its practitioners in China"" In 1999. This investigation is not about the Falun Gong movement or its practices, but about media properties linked to the movement.:According to a 2004 description on their website, the inspiration for The Epoch Times' founding was a ""response to the growing need for uncensored coverage of events in China."" As part of an effort to raise awareness about their cause and persecution, Falun Gong followers created a global web of media entities, including a newspaper, a television station, and a radio station: The Epoch Times, New Tang Dynasty TV (NTD TV), and Sound of Hope Radio. Starting in 2016, these companies began to dedicate significant resources to entering the pro-Trump media market.""Before 2016, The Epoch Times generally stayed out of U.S. politics, unless they dovetailed with Chinese interests,"" NBC News reported in August 2019. ""The publication's recent ad strategy, coupled with a broader campaign to embrace social media and conservative U.S. politics -- Trump in particular -- has doubled The Epoch Times' revenue ... and pushed it to greater prominence in the broader conservative media world."" From a raw numbers perspective, the paper's support of Trump is prolific. On Facebook, The Epoch Times has ""spent more money on pro-Trump ... s than any group other than the Trump campaign,"" NBC stated.:The Epoch Times' actions have also drawn the scrutiny of Facebook, who in July 2019 began to ban some Epoch Times Facebook pages from running political ads. ""Over the past year we removed accounts associated with the Epoch Times for violating our ad policies, including trying to get around our review systems,"" a Facebook spokesperson told NBC news. To circumvent this hurdle, The Epoch Times used ""sock-puppet"" Facebook accounts to direct users to generically named URLs such as genuinenewspaper.com and truthandtradition.news which then redirected those users to The Epoch Times' subscription page, NBC News reported. This work-around appears to have been shut down by Facebook by August 2019.A response to NBC News' reporting in the form of an open letter first published on the Falun Gong website faluninfo.net accused NBC reporters Brandy Zadrozny and Ben Collins of presenting ""distortions that track very closely to official Chinese communist party propaganda points."" This open letter was published on NTD.com, The Epoch Times website, and -- notably -- TheBL.com.The Many, Many Connections Between The BL and The Epoch Times:The assertion that ""The BL has no connection with The Epoch Times"" strains credulity for several reasons. The BL -- which we again note stands for ""The Beauty of Life"" -- is owned by a company first registered in California as Beauties of Life, Inc. in 2016. The company later switched its state of incorporation to Wyoming and its name to The Beauty of Life, Inc. Two individuals are named in the Wyoming corporate documents as directors of the company: Trung Vu and John Nania. Trung Vu had been the CEO of the Vietnamese edition of The Epoch Times and later worked for the related NTD TV. John Nania served as editor in chief at The Epoch Times English edition from 2004 to 2015 and later for a website, America Daily, that was run by another Falun Gong-linked media operation: Sound of Hope Radio Network::In response to a followup email in which we listed several apparent connections between The BL and The Epoch Times, an unnamed person at The BL told us that ""Our CEO Trung Vu was the CEO of Epoch Times Vietnam from 2014, and had been working for NTD Television from mid 2016 to the end of 2017. He left NTD and has been fully working on The BL after that.""Despite claims of total corporate independence between The BL and Epoch Times properties, Vu used his NTD email address when he registered The Beauty of Life, Inc. in 2019 -- two years after he allegedly left NTD TV. ""The email in the document is his old email address, it doesn't mean The BL is a property of NTD or has connection with NTD Television company,"" The BL explained, without explaining how or why the email address had been used as recently as January 2019, two years after Vu was said to have left NTD.The BL also asserted in their email that their ""servers and network infrastructure are ... own[ed] by The BL."" But at least one server used by The BL at the time of this writing was registered to Epoch Times Vietnam by Trung Vu -- another fact we raised for which we did not receive a direct response. Like the email address used in corporate documents, Vu chose to use this contact information despite the fact that the server was registered well after Beauties of Life, Inc. had been incorporated as its own company.:The Middletown, New York, address listed for The BL is not without its own connections to Falun Gong associated media, either. Based on public record searches performed by Snopes, that location is linked to or owned by the Falun Gong ""Sound of Hope Radio Network."" As it turns out, this connection may be because the same address was once the location of a production studio used by well-known Falun Gong YouTuber Mikey Chen, who produces the shows ""Beyond Science"" and ""Strictly Dumpling,"" among others. Until he left this studio and created what may be his own media company, these shows were produced by the Sound of Hope Radio Network, Inc. according to employee descriptions of their work which we found on LinkedIn::A video tour of the actual office in question, in which at least two people we identify as past writers for The Epoch Times are introduced, is available on Chen's YouTube channel and matches real estate photographs advertising the Middletown property. ""The BL is ... not a company or property of Sound of Hope Radio Network, we rent the office in Middletown NY,"" The BL told us, without disclosing from whom they rented it.A suspiciously large number of The BL's editorial staff members are currently or were previously in the employ of The Epoch Times. The managing editor of The BL, Orysia McCabe, at the time of this writing listed her current employer on LinkedIn as The Epoch Times. The page manager of the The BL's main Facebook page, Margaret Trey, was a health and wellness writer for The Epoch Times and a writer for NTD TV.Several political writers or commentators have a similar background. Angela Anderson, an on-camera host for The BL, wrote for Epoch Times until June 2019. Matt Tullar, another on-camera host and commentator, was once the director of circulation for The Epoch Times and lists his current job on LinkedIn as sales & marketing director for the Orange County edition of The Epoch Times. Gregory, the Epoch Times publisher, told us ""Tullar stopped working for The Epoch Times in October 2016. The Orange County edition of The Epoch Times closed years ago."":Chris Ford, The BL's politics editor, wrote for The Epoch Times until August 2019. Several other of The BL's political reporters come from The Epoch Times as well. A ""few of our staff has job experience ... working in The Epoch Times, but now they are working full time in The BL,"" The BL explained to us via email.On at least one occasion a video about the persecution of Falun Gong posted on the Epoch Times website displayed an overt link between NTD TV, Epoch Times, and The BL -- all three were listed as sponsors in the video's credits. Asked why all three entities were included at the end of the video if no connection existed between The BL and the other two companies, Stephen Gregory, The Epoch Times' publisher, told us that ""the video was an external production and lists media companies who promoted the production."":The BL, for their part, reiterated in their second email to us that ""The BL is a separate company and independent from The Epoch Times, not a property of The Epoch Times or [connected] with [them]. It is just different media company with [a] different vision.""A ""Different Vision""""The BL,"" according to the About section of their Facebook page, ""is like a pure mountain spring, moistening the heart of every reader. It aims to plant the seeds of sincerity, goodness, and tolerance deep into the soul, so that it may grow and prosper."" Their mission, they state, is ""to present to the world the most beautiful aspects of life [by focusing] on content that represents fundamental moral standards and values."" Vague aphorisms aside, The BL -- like The Epoch Times -- is a hotbed of fervent Trump fandom.""We're proud to show our support for this president and we choose to report on the many positive outcomes and values-based direction this presidency is going,"" BL video host Rich Crankshaw explained in a Facebook ad for The BL. ""The mainstream media serves to instill fear and hate into the hearts of their followers ... Instead of just reporting the facts, we aim to balance that negativity with The BL, the beauty of life, and the greatness of this nation."":Editorially, The BL provides the same fawning coverage of Trump as The Epoch Times, content which serves to amplify White House talking points and proffer (or repost) pro-Trump takes on White House scandals. The BL, for example, has attempted to discredit the Ukraine whistleblower as part of a George Soros conspiracy and has pushed the conspiracy theory that the Clinton family kills their political enemies. At least one BL-owned Facebook page has promoted the pro-Trump QAnon conspiracy theory. Sometimes cutting out the middleman entirely, The BL directly reposts unedited statements from the White House, as they did for their anti-Mueller post ""The 2-year, $25 million witch hunt.""From an advertising perspective, The BL's approach also appears indistinguishable from The Epoch Times': purchase a massive volume of Facebook ads that are putatively promotions for their outlet but are in most cases indistinguishable from basic Trump campaign ads:There are multiple official ""The BL"" pages on Facebook, and many of them have paid for these pro-Trump ads. Their main English-language page, The BL.com, has spent a total of $276,929 on Facebook ads. The BL TV and The BL Story spent over $100,000 each on Facebook ads. The BL Video, The BL News, and The BL Shedding Light spent another $12,000 or so. All told, at least $510,698 has gone to Facebook from The BL.:The BL's success in preventing their ads from being banned by Facebook is also comparable to the success exhibited by the Epoch Times, which is to say extremely limited. Based on Facebook's Ad Library tool, The BL posted 908 ads, of which 864 were taken down for violating Facebook's policies. All 121 of the ads run by The BL TV and all 168 run by The BL Stories were removed as well. The outlet, as a whole, hasn't posted a Facebook ad since August 2019, roughly when Facebook started cracking down on Epoch Times-related content.We reached out to Facebook to ask if these BL pages have been banned from running ads and if that circumstance was due to a link to The Epoch Times, but we had not received a response by press time. The BL appears to be employing other methods to gain followers outside of ad buys, however.How Does The BL Have 28 Million Followers on Facebook?:The BL's Facebook reach is massive and expanding. The Spanish-language BL page Bellezas de la Vida is the largest, with over 10 million followers. That page, perhaps counter-intuitively, appears most aggressive, with some pro-Trump conspiracy theories, postings about Q, and s for a show that alleges real collusion between the Clintons and China. There are, at our last count, at least 22 Facebook BL pages with the BL logo, some of which are geared toward different countries, languages, and themes. The BL's presence in the Asian market, based on links from The BL's English edition, appears to go by the name DKN TV.But The BL's Facebook operation is more than just these official pages. The BL Facebook pages, as well as accounts tied to The BL's staff members, appear to be gaining control of and/or creating several pages and groups with no obvious link to the BL, gaining control of their followers, and in some cases adding links to a BL website. Such pages and groups are in some cases officially created by The BL, leading to a complex web of interrelated Trump pages ultimately moderated by Facebook profiles with a clear connection to both The Epoch Times and The BL. A Facebook account bearing the same name as managing editor Orysia McCabe, as an example, appears to run at least six pro-Trump Facebook groups that are linked to The BL. Matt Tullar, host and commentator for The BL, seems to run at least three.:As another example, an official BL-controlled Facebook group is named PRESIDENT TRUMP - AMERICA 2020. This group's connection to The BL is not secret, as it is listed as one of the groups on The BL's main English-language Facebook page. The Trump 2020 group has several moderators or administrators, including one that is a Vietnamese-based page named America First. America First, in turn, serves as the moderator for at least 17 other groups whose other moderators are clearly linked to The Epoch Times and/or The BL. A group named TRUMP MAGA 2020 moderated by America First, for example, is also moderated by the Facebook account of David Montgomery. Montgomery, on his own Facebook timeline, has interacted with The BL's CEO Trung Vu and primarily shares links to both The Epoch Times and The BL.Other pages or groups appear to have been purchased or otherwise transferred from unrelated entities. These pages, whose names often include the themes ""Beauty"" and ""Life,"" predate the formation of the media network but now advertise a link to a BL website and even sometimes display the Middletown, New York, address, while consisting solely of posts unrelated to The BL.:An example of this practice can be found in a Chinese-language page whose English-language URL is ""BeautiesOfLifeLoveQuotes."" This page was created in 2014 and has built a substantial following of over 800,000 users. Prior to 2017, when the name of the group was changed, its content consisted primarily of sultry pictures of women. Following this shift, it started posting what appear to be uplifting text and photo memes about relationships. In terms of content, there is no reason to think the page has anything to do with The BL, yet the page -- with its substantial follower base -- displays a link to the Chinese-language version of The BL and a map to the Middletown address.Scanning for BL-related groups that fit either of the above descriptions, Snopes has identified at least 60 additional groups or pages tied to The BL but which lack their logo in their profile photos or ""The BL"" in their titles. All told, these Facebook entities' followers comprise at least 3.5 million of the 28 million followers of all BL pages or groups we identify in the table below. By any metric, this is a massive reach for a media outlet.To What End?:We do not know why The BL refuses to acknowledge any connection to the broader Epoch Times media group, nor do we know what they plan to do with the prodigious number of followers they appear to be rapidly accumulating. What we do know, however, is both The Epoch Times and The BL are being less than forthright by categorically denying any connection between their organizations.In the early 2000s, the Wall Street Journal described one of the major problems facing the perceived legitimacy of The Epoch Times as ""their unwillingness to identify themselves as having any association with the [Falun Gong], despite ample evidence to the contrary."" Faced with the same quandary, The BL seems to have a similar aversion to admitting any association with The Epoch Times."
396,396,587.ExplainerATTandVeriz,"On Jan. 17, 2022, Reuters published the headline: ""Major U.S. airlines warn 5G could ground some planes, wreak havoc."" The reporting documented a letter sent by the airline industry to U.S. government officials asking that AT&T and Verizon implement 5G ""everywhere in the country"" on Jan. 19, as planned, ""except within the approximate 2 miles of [50 large airport runways].""The concerns, which were not new, purportedly stemmed from the idea that the planned deployment of the 5G wireless networks could interfere with radio altimeters. Both 5G networks and aircraft altimeters use different frequencies on what's known on the radio spectrum as C-Band.On Jan. 18, the day after the letter was published, AT&T and Verizon both said they would once again delay a small percentage of their 5G service deployment ""near key airports."" U.S. President Joe Biden thanked both companies for agreeing to do so.Conspiracy theories about 5G networks have been around for at least a few years. However, in this case, it didn't appear to involve a conspiracy theory. Instead, this appeared to be a matter of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the airline industry aiming for precautions to be taken before the 5G networks launched, despite the two telecom giants insisting they were unnecessary.:Here's what we found in our research.Altimeters and 5G""The new high-speed 5G service uses a segment of the radio spectrum that is close to that used by altimeters, which are devices that measure the height of aircraft above the ground,"" the Associated Press reported.In 2020, in order to resolve safety concerns, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) determined that ""C-Band could be used safely in the vicinity of air traffic."" It established ""a buffer between the 5G band and the spectrum that planes use.""What does this look like in terms of frequencies? In December 2021, Aviation Today broke down the numbers:Radio spectrum, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, is divided into different frequency bands that have been allocated for data, voice, and wireless communications used by a variety of different industries. Aircraft radar altimeters operate within 4.2-4.4 GHz, the lower half of which falls within the C-Band -- a frequency range from 3.7-4.2 GHz where the combination of the range of signal transmissions and capacity are optimum.The 5G wireless networks scheduled to be switched on by AT&T and Verizon next month will occur within the 3.7-3.98 GHz frequency range, close to the altimeters. As the FAA indicated in its Dec. 7 AD, while it has heard concerns from airlines, the FAA, and aircraft OEMs over the potential interference issues posed by the deployment of 5G in the C-Band, it has not yet been presented with data or information that shows altimeters are not susceptible to interference.:In other words, radio altimeters operate within the 4.2-4.4GHz frequency range, and 5G was set to launch in the U.S. close to that, between 3.7-3.98GHz.The Airline IndustryThe Reuters story described a letter from Airlines for America that was addressed to U.S. government officials. It was signed by leadership from Alaska Air Group, American Airlines, Atlas Air Worldwide, Delta Air Lines, FedEx Express, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines Holdings, UPS Airlines, and Airlines for America.The subject line read: ""Immediate Action to Address 5G Interference with National Aviation System."":The letter from the airline industry, dated Jan. 17, documented a request for yet another delay in the deployment of AT&T and Verizon 5G wireless networks within 2 miles of runways at 50 large airports. It claimed that the 5G deployment would result in a ""major disruption"" that would cause ""harmful impacts on the aviation industry, traveling public, supply chain, vaccine distribution, workforce, and the broader economy."" The reason was due to FAA regulations that required radio altimeters to be properly approved for safety, something the airline industry argued couldn't be accomplished for all critical aircraft before Jan. 19.The airline industry warned that the deployment of 5G wireless networks could potentially lead to ""incalculable"" and ""catastrophic"" results, again referring to grounded flights. ""To be blunt, the nation's commerce will grind to a halt,"" the airlines claimed. A United Airlines airplane proceeds to a gate at Newark Liberty International Airport as the sun rises behind the skyline of lower Manhattan and One World Trade Center in New York City on December 13, 2021, in Newark, New Jersey. (Photo by Gary Hershorn/Getty Images): United Airlines also published its own news release on the subject, specifying the purported dangers not only to aircraft altimeters, but also to ""autopilot, heads-up displays, terrain warning, and pitch control."" It said that this ""will result in significant restrictions on 787s, 777s, 737s and regional aircraft in major cities like Houston, Newark, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago.""The FAA RegulationsAligned with the airline industry's concerns was the FAA. Reuters reported that the FAA ""warned that potential interference could affect sensitive airplane instruments such as altimeters and significantly hamper low-visibility operations.""The FAA wrote that it requires all radar altimeters to be ""accurate and reliable,"" saying that it had found some altimeters fit this criteria ""in the 5G areas,"" but that ""others must be retrofitted or replaced."":After we contacted the FAA, the agency pointed us to a Safety Alert for Operators (SAFO) notice from Dec. 23, 2021. It detailed the specific concern that had caused multiple delays in the deployment of 5G wireless networks:The radio altimeter is more precise than a barometric altimeter and for that reason is used where aircraft height over the ground needs to be precisely measured, such as during autoland or other low altitude operations. The receiver on the radio altimeter is typically highly accurate, however, it may deliver erroneous results in the presence of out-of-band radiofrequency emissions from other frequency bands. The radio altimeter must detect faint signals reflected off the ground to measure altitude, in a manner similar to radar. Out-of-band signals could significantly degrade radio altimeter functions if the altimeter is unable to sufficiently reject those signals.In an email, a spokesperson for the FAA told us: ""Our concerns are mostly focused on what happens when [5G] transmitters malfunction and send out signals that don't stay within their band or are at such power levels that they bleed over.""The agency also published on its website that it doesn't make assumptions when it comes to safety::Aviation in the U.S. is the safest in the world. That's because we rely on data to mitigate risk, and never assume that a piece of equipment or a given flight scenario is safe until this can be demonstrated. If there's the possibility of a risk to the flying public, we are obligated to restrict the relevant flight activity until we can prove it is safe.In other words, the FAA was saying that it was taking precautions to ensure that radio altimeters were properly checked and approved prior to the Jan. 19 deployment of 5G near 50 large airports, in the event that those telecommunications signals potentially landed outside of the approved frequency range on C-Band.AT&T and Verizon RespondThe Associated Press published an explainer on the back-and-forth, saying that AT&T and Verizon had ""dismissed"" the airline industry's concerns::The wireless industry trade group Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) notes that about 40 countries have deployed the C-Band strand of 5G without reports of harmful interference with aviation equipment.But AT&T CEO John Stankey and Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg did offer to reduce the power of their 5G networks near airports, as France has done.""The laws of physics are the same in the United States and France,"" Stankey and Vestberg said in a letter Sunday to [Secretary of Transportation Pete] Buttigieg and [Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Stephen M.] Dickson. ""If U.S. airlines are permitted to operate flights every day in France, then the same operating conditions should allow them to do so in the United States.""As previously noted, after the letter from the Reuters report was published, AT&T and Verizon both agreed to yet another delay to a small percentage of their 5G network rollout on Jan. 19.'40 Countries':According to the Global mobile Suppliers Association, it's true that 5G was already deployed in more than 40 countries. The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA), which ""represents the U.S. wireless communications industry and companies throughout the mobile ecosystem,"" published a video that showed a map of the locations:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6ZMQ0jhJ-E According to the CTIA-sponsored website, 5gandaviation.com, C-Band was chosen for 5G networks because its radio waves can ""deliver high speeds over a wide geographic area.""In its FAQ, the CTIA published: ""In fact, in some of these countries, 5G signals use radio waves that are much closer to those used by aviation equipment without causing harmful interference."" This appeared to be true of Japan, for example.The FAA responded to this as well, saying: ""Deployments of 5G technology in other countries often involve different conditions than those proposed for the U.S., including lower power levels, antennas tilted downward to reduce potential interference to flights, different placement of antennas relative to airfields, and frequencies with a different proximity to frequencies used by aviation equipment."":As of Jan. 18, it's unclear when the small percentage of 5G deployments near the aforementioned 50 large airports will eventually occur. This story will be updated should more details come to light.Curious about how Snopes' writers verify information and craft their stories for public consumption?

397,397,460.IsGeorgeSorosGroomin,"Claim:Billionaire philanthropist George Soros is ""grooming"" Abdul El-Sayed, who is ""sympathetic"" to the Muslim Brotherhood, to be president of the United States.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In late November and early December 2017, a Facebook post reported without any evidence that a candidate for governor of Michigan is being ""groomed"" by billionaire philanthropist George Soros and is sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood. The post, which prompted troubling comments, appears to have been inspired by an April 2017 story in the far-right tabloid WND.com (formerly WorldNetDaily). It reads::Don't ever say you weren't warned-'He IS on his way''He IS being groomed at this very minute'PRESIDENT ABDUL EL-SAYED?Etch this man's name in your mind.His name is Abdul El-Sayed.After years of being groomed by George Soros. He has been hand-picked by the Left to be their next ""champion"" of Hope and Change.He is 32 years old, born in the USA, and an extremely well educated Muslim Doctor in Detroit Michigan. (education funded by Soros)He is handsome, articulate, charismatic and smart.He is sympathetic of the Muslim Brotherhood, and is running for Governor of Michigan,Which is Step 1 in his preparation to run for President of the United StatesHe has the potential to be Obama #2, but far more openly Muslim.Abdulrahman Mohamed El-Sayed is an American physician, epidemiologist, public health advocate, and politician.He has announced his candidacy for Governor of Michigan, running as a Democrat.Wikipedia:Born: October 31, 1984 (age 32), MichiganAwards: Rhodes Scholarship; Paul and Daisy Soros; Fellowships for New; AmericansEducation: University of Michigan, Ann; Arbor (BA); Oriel College, Oxford (MA, PhD); Columbia University (MD)Political party: Democratic Party.In 2020 he will be eligible to run for President!Democrats' mouths are watering in anticipation and raising money.Elizabeth ""Pocahontas"" Warren is already campaigning for him. Another Trojan Horse?Al Jazeera, which is widely read by Michigan's large Muslim population is doing its best to help George make him ""YOUR"" president in 2020!Bet you never dreamed an unknown, like Obama, would end up as the President of the United States of America FOR 8 YEARS, did you?DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN, AGAIN.FORWARD TO ALL,:The idea that George Soros, a Hungarian-American Jew, is pulling the strings in a plot to take over the U.S. (this time vis-a-vis the Michigan gubernatorial race and candidate Abdul El-Sayed) threads into the ubiquitous anti-Semitic conspiracy theory known as the ""New World Order."" The theory posits a secret cabal of rich (and Jewish) financiers are angling to establish an authoritarian global government and, among other things, force America to become more diverse.El-Sayed is not sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood, but he's not the first Muslim American to step into public life only to have that accusation lobbed at him. After Gold Star father Khizr Khan spoke in support of Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention in 2016, he was falsely accused by anti-Muslim conspiracy trolls of being a Muslim Brotherhood ""operative.""El-Sayed has said publicly he is a firm supporter of the separation of church and state -- which puts him at complete odds with the Muslim Brotherhood, an international theocratic movement that aims to combine religion with government.El-Sayed is an American progressive, a political movement left of liberalism that seeks things like universal health care, an increased minimum wage and equality for the LGBT community. He is also pro-choice. His stances on LGBT and women's reproductive rights place him in polar opposition to the Muslim Brotherhood. Ani Zonneveld, president of the organization Muslims for Progressive Values told us the Muslim Brotherhood's views on those issues are similar to conservative Christians in the U.S. in that they want to legislate anti-gay and pro-life policy due to their religious beliefs.:What is true is that El-Sayed is indeed a ""well educated Muslim Doctor in Detroit."" At 32, he is the youngest person to have served as director of Detroit's Health Department. Born in Michigan to immigrant parents from Egypt, he earned an M.D. from Columbia University in 2014 and a PhD in public health from Oxford University in 2011. During the course of his education he was awarded several prestigious scholarships including Rhodes, Marshall and the Paul and Daisy Soros fellowship in 2012. Paul Soros, George Soros's now-deceased older brother, launched the Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans with his wife in 1998. It is a competitive, merit-based program that every year accepts 30 immigrants or children of immigrants who are pursuing graduate school in the United States and can demonstrate that they will ""make significant contributions to the United States though their future work,"" fellowship director Craig Harwood told us. About the selection process, Harwood said:Every applicant must submit two essays, information about their background and accomplishments, and any relevant exhibits about their work. In addition, they need three to five recommendations. It's not an easy application process.  Our selection process, which is based on this criteria, is divided into two phases. The first phase is the screening process where we employ a diverse set of skilled readers who are a mix of professors, higher education administrators, and experts in a range of professional fields. The screening process narrows the field to 77 applicants who then become our finalists. We then hold seven days of interviews where we engage dozens of panelists who, like the readers, are experts in a range of fields. George Soros is not involved in any way with the selection process. :We asked El-Sayed's campaign about the accusations made in the post and a spokesperson referred us to an August 2017 profile in The Guardian in which he flatly denied each of them in an interview with journalist Drew Philp:""Are you the spear tip of a vast Muslim conspiracy to bring Sharia law to the US?""""No,"" [El-Sayed] said.""Are you a front for the Muslim brotherhood to pervert American politics towards terrorism?""""No.""""Were you handpicked by George Soros to lead a vast liberal takeover of the government?""""No. I've never met George Soros."""

""The World Economic Forum never made such claims and has no authority and also no intention to give orders to governments and other institutions or individuals.""The WEF has long been the target of conspiracy theories. For example, the organization proposed a set of public health and economic proposals for countries to consider during the COVID-19 pandemic to create ""a healthier, more equitable, and more prosperous future."" Those proposals became the basis for ""The Great Reset"" conspiracy theory, which advocates unfounded accusations that international elites were using the COVID-19 pandemic to create a global totalitarian regime.:The WEF has no formal authority over governments.

Snopes wrote about the proposed bill and found it's more complicated than critics claim.In February 2023, the lower house of the Spanish Congress passed a measure to amend a portion of criminal code regarding animal abuse. In our story, we wrote, ""In large part, this controversy is caused by imprecise language. While many Spanish legal experts disagree that the law legalizes or decriminalizes bestiality, some have concerns that the new wording could, at least theoretically, make it harder to convict some individuals for sexual acts with animals.""The Senate must approve the measure before it becomes law, and we'll update this fact check if, or when, that happens.:The NewsPunch article also included a Twitter post from far-right commentator James Lindsay.

The testimony came as the U.S. experienced a spike in reported COVID-19 cases.Although scientists believe that the novel coronavirus, the virus causing the COVID-19 disease pandemic, had animal origins before it infected humans, the Trump administration has promoted an unfounded conspiracy theory that the disease originated in a lab in Wuhan, China, where it was originally detected in the winter of 2019.U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey asked Fauci about the grant, stating it didn't make any sense to him that funding for research on the coronavirus had been canceled ""while we are in the midst of a coronavirus pandemic,"" asking Fauci if he knew why the decision had been made.:""Why was it canceled? It was canceled because the NIH was told to cancel it,"" Fauci replied. ""I don't know the reason, but we were told to cancel it.""The exchange can be heard right after the 4:36 mark in this C-SPAN video.Fauci later clarified to Politico that it was the White House specifically that directed NIH to cut off the funding.Funding for the research project, which was run by the U.S. non-profit EcoHealth Alliance, was pulled on April 24. The move raised suspicion that it was done for political reasons, as the science and technology outlet Ars Technica reported:The funding cut could set back critical research into preventing such disease spread, scientists say. They also expressed dismay that the decision was prompted by unfounded conspiracy theories and what some see as a wider attempt by the Trump administration to deflect criticism of its handling of the pandemic by blaming China for unleashing the disease.:The move was criticized by scientists, who called it counterproductive in the fight against the pandemic.Because Fauci stated in public testimony that NIH was told to cancel a grant for coronavirus research and later clarified to Politico that it was the White House that had initiated cutting a research grant for the EcoHealth Alliance research, we rate this claim ""Correct Attribution."""

401,401,387.WasRihannaBannedFrom,"Claim:Rihanna was barred from entering Senegal on the grounds that she was suspected of being part of the Illuminati.Rating:Mostly FalseAbout this rating What's TrueA Muslim-led collective of religious groups protested against Rihanna's visit to Senegal in February 2018, on the grounds that she was a member of the freemasons and Illuminati. What's FalseRihanna was not actually banned from Senegal, and the country's president joined her at an NGO event.:Superstars like Jay-Z, Beyonce and Katy Perry are the common targets of conspiracy theorists who claim the stars are either secret Satanists or part of the Illuminati -- a shadowy, elite (and non-existent) cabal of ultra-wealthy celebrities, bankers and politicians who secretly rule the world. So when YourNewsWire.com -- a well-known purveyor of fake news and conspiracy theories -- reported in February 2018 that Rihanna had been banned from entering Senegal ""because she's 'Illuminati,'"" you could be forgiven for dismissing the story out of hand. For once, however, there is something to these claims about dissent against Rihanna's visit to the West African nation. Activists did protest against the singer's appearance at an event in Senegal and did accuse Rihanna of being part of the Illuminati, but the government did not ban her from entering the country and she did ultimately visit.  ""Protestors have violently blocked Rihanna from entering the West African nation of Senegal,"" YourNewsWire.com wrote, ""because of her 'affiliation with the Illuminati,' according to reports."":The protests turned ""violent"", according to local reports, as protestors claimed Rihanna has aligned herself with the Illuminati, a shadowy group of global elites working to establish a New World Order. The protestors are backed by politicians and religious leaders in the country who have also been working to block Rihanna's visit to Senegal, claiming that she flaunts her membership of the Illuminati.The post cites a 1 February report by the Paris-based Jeune Afrique (which translates to ""Young Africa"") news web site. That article reads:Expected in Senegal on Friday, the singer is not welcome in the eyes of around 30 religious organizations united under the collective name ""No to freemasonry and homosexuality."" Some members suspect her of being a member of the freemasons. The article was published a day before Rihanna's visit to Senegal in early February where she joined other global dignitaries, including French President Emmanuel Macron, at an event promoting education in developing countries. She was due to attend in her capacity as an ambassador for the Global Partnership for Education, a Washington, DC-based group that supports basic schooling in 65 nations. :According to Jeune Afrique, the protest against Rihanna's visit was prompted, in part, by a YouTube video posted last week which outlined a conspiracy theory around claiming Rihanna's visit to the country ""was orchestrated with the complicity of the government, in order to roll out an educational regime that aims to create future generations of loyal disciples of Satan.""""Rihanna doesn't hide it,"" said Cheikh Oumar Diagne, a spokesperson for the collective, ""she is part of the Illuminati, which is a branch of the freemasons.""He adds:In fact, her visit oddly coincides with the originally scheduled date of the [association of African freemasonry lodges.] From our point of view, this is an attempt at a distraction to hide this freemason meeting from the public. The meeting of African freemasons was due to take place between 2 and 3 February in the Senegalese capital of Dakar, but was cancelled after opposition from the same religious collective forced a local hotel to pull out as the venue. :In the end, Rihanna's visit to Senegal went ahead, and she appeared at the conference with French President Emmanuel Macron, as well as Senegal's president Macky Sall, and gave a short address to the audience.Today's @GPforEducation Replenishment Conference in Dakar, Senegal raised over $2.3B for global education!?? @rihanna @GlblCtzn #FundEducation #CLF pic.twitter.com/FjBMvGHdPJ-- Clara Lionel Fdn (@ClaraLionelFdn) February 2, 2018 While the YourNewsWire.com article contains a rare kernel of truth and accurately cites articles by reputable news organizations like Jeune Afrique and The Guardian, it also indulges in its customary touting of conspiracy theories, falsely claiming that Rihanna describes herself as an ""Illuminati Princess"" and that she had been ""caught instructing children to pray to Satan."":Furthermore, the article falsely claimed that the singer had been barred from entering Senegal.

What's FalseLester Holt did not break the debate rules by wearing an earpiece. :In the days following the first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in 2016, a series of rumors and conspiracy theories were circulated in an attempt to somehow prove that the night had been rigged by the Democratic presidential nominee. After failing to provide evidence for any of these baseless claims -- Hillary Clinton didn't wear an earpiece, she didn't communicate with moderator Lester Holt via secrethand signals, she wasn't given the debate questions weeks in advance -- conspiracy theorist Alex Jones turned his sights on the moderator, claiming that Lester Holt broke the debate rules by wearing an earpiece::Jones based his accusation on a clip of Holt sitting at the moderator's desk and fiddling with something in his ear. The image of Holt glancing over his shoulder while sitting in an apparently empty room gave the appearance that the debate moderator was hiding something.However, there was nothing to hide. Lester Holt clearly wore an earpiece during the presidential debate on 26 September 2016:Embed from Getty Images:Holt's wearing an earpiece during the debate did not break any rules set by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Under the CPD's guidelines, moderators are allowed to use earpieces so that they can be kept abreast of the time:During primary debates (including the Democratic debate Holt moderated in January) TV producers can speak with the moderator through earpieces, proposing followup questions and supporting the host. Some production teams are more hands-on than others.But it works differently at general election debates organized by the commission. The only person in Holt's ear will be the commission's longtime executive producer, Marty Slutsky, who has produced all of the debates since 2000.Slutsky keeps track of time and lets moderators know when they have to wrap up the debate."

Years after the Sandy Hook mass shooting, for example, victims' families still report harassment and death threats.:Amidst all of this, a fake tweet emerged aimed at defaming David Hogg, one of the most vocal survivors of the 14 February 2018 high school shooting in which a gunman murdered seventeen people:The earliest example of this message that we could uncover was a 26 February 2018 thread on the web site 4Chan where a user posted it without any source information. The users debated briefly about whether the image was real (it's not) before devolving into a litany of racial slurs. The fake message was supposedly posted in June 2016, but it does not appear on Hogg's timeline, nor is there any cached record of it stored anywhere (yet there are dozens of other tweets from Hogg archived): ::David Hogg did not post this homophobic message on Twitter. This is a doctored image that was created in an attempt to smear the reputation of a young man who survived a school shooting.

404,404,585.DidZelenskyyTrollPut,"Claim:In March 2022, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy touched a microphone in a video, in satirical reference to a ""visual effects"" rumor about Russian President Vladimir Putin.Rating:UnprovenAbout this rating OriginIn March 2022, during Russia's invasion of Ukraine and in the context of an intense struggle to control various narratives around the conflict, internet users -- primarily those sympathetic to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy -- enthusiastically shared a remarkable claim: that Zelenskyy had ""trolled"" his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin by touching a microphone during a video message.:According to proponents, that gesture was an allusion to an existing theory, which held that video footage apparently showing Putin's hand passing through a microphone was proof he was using graphic effects to pretend he was holding meetings in public. On March 5, for example, one widely-shared tweet contained a montage of two clips: one supposedly showing Putin's hand passing through a mic, and the other showing Zelenskyy touching a similar mic and moving it to one side. The tweet explained:Troll Level: Presidential. Putin released a video but it was a fake that Putin made to show he isn't cowering away somewhere. Putin's hand goes through the microphone, so Zelensky showed he's actually real, by moving the mic.:Similar social media posts and YouTube videos contained the same 15-second montage. We know that the video of Putin was authentic, and not the result of graphic effects or a ""green screen"" -- higher quality footage clearly and definitively demonstrates that his hand passed behind the mic, and not through it. This component of the theory is therefore false. However, we have not yet been able to determine the accuracy of the key part of the theory -- the claim that Zelenskyy touched a microphone as an allusion to the ""Putin green screen"" theory, and as a way to publicly ""troll"" his Russian counterpart. As a result, we are issuing a rating of ""Unproven,"" for now. If definitive evidence becomes available, we will update this fact check accordingly.The Putin ""Green Screen"" CanardInternet users, primarily those critical of Putin and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, enthusiastically shared the Putin ""green screen"" claim, beginning on March 5, in large part because it suggested he was, in fact, hiding in a secure, private location, while pretending to be out in public meeting civilians. That footage can be viewed below::https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCLpV-nTBV8 In that version of the footage, Putin's right hand appears to pass through the mic in front of him::However, this was an illusion caused by a low-quality rendering of the video, and not the result of an elaborate hoax on the part of Putin. The footage was recorded at a meeting Putin held with Russian airline staff on the afternoon of March 5, as shown in pictures taken by photographer Mikhail Klimentyev. Higher quality footage posted online by several outlets lacks such illusions, and demonstrates the footage was authentic. For example, here's how the same moment appeared in a Daily Telegraph video of the event::And in a higher resolution video posted by Rupor Moscow::Similar high resolution videos were also posted by Russian state-owned outlets RT and Zvezda. The footage was not the result of visual effects, and the ""green screen"" theory was unfounded. Zelenskyy's 'Genius Trolling'?However, even though we know the Putin theory was unfounded, this has no relevance to whether or not Zelenskyy made a sly reference to it in a subsequent video, by touching a mic and moving it to one side. Zelenskyy could have done this because he believed the Putin green screen theory, or because he wanted to make fun of it regardless of how accurate he believed it to be. The Zelenskyy component of the montage consists of two main parts: first, Zelenskyy stands with his hands on a podium and says ""Slava Ukraini"" (""Glory to Ukraine""), as he does at the end of most speeches; then Zelenskyy takes his hands off the podium, touches the mic with his right hand, and swivels it to his left::https://youtu.be/qCLpV-nTBV8?t=8 Snopes has concluded that the first component of the clip originated in a video message which Zelenskyy's team posted online on the evening of March 5. Here is the same moment as shown in a YouTube video containing the Putin theory::And in a similar tweet posted by Lyubov Sobol, a Russian opposition political activist::And finally, in the video posted to Zelenskyy's official YouTube account: Those moments are clearly identical, and that March 5 video was undoubtedly the source of the first component of the Zelenskyy ""troll"" clip.:However, the second component -- where Zelenskyy touches and moves the mic -- is not shown in the official videos posted online by Zelenskyy. This is a confounding and confusing gap in the evidence, which we have not yet been able to explain. Here is what we do know, though:At 9:29pm Kyiv time (2:29pm EST, 7:29pm GMT) Zelenskyy's Telegram account posted the video messageAt the exact same time, Zelenskyy's Facebook account posted itAt unspecified times on the evening of March 5, Zelenskyy's YouTube and Instagram accounts also posted the same message. None of those videos contained a moment in which Zelenskyy's right hand touched and moved the microphone. Three primary possible explanations exist. Firstly, the ""mic touch"" moment could have been included in an early version of the video message, published online by Zelenskyy's staff, which was subsequently removed and replaced with the official versions now available. Secondly, the ""mic touch"" could have been part of the raw footage recorded by Zelenskyy's team, and then privately leaked to a third party or posted online on an unofficial social media channel. Thirdly, the ""mic touch"" could have been the result of a ""deepfake"" -- a piece of digital editing which somehow fabricated or stitched together footage to make it appear as though Zelenskyy had touched the mic and swiveled it to one side.:The latter scenario seems particularly unlikely. Based on the smooth and continuous movements shown in the ""mic touch"" footage, any fake would have to be exceptionally sophisticated. We checked early archived versions of the URL associated with the YouTube and Facebook videos, but found no record of an earlier, longer official video that included the ""mic touch,"" though we can't rule that out as a possible explanation. We also found no positive evidence that someone with access to the raw footage of Zelenskyy's March 5 speech either leaked it to a third party, privately, or posted it themselves via an unofficial social media account, or using an alias. The earliest instance of the Putin/Zelenskyy trolling video that we could find was posted to Twitter at 10:39 p.m. Kyiv time (3:39 p.m. EST / 8:39 p.m. GMT) -- just over an hour after the official Zelenskyy video message was first published, at 9:29 p.m. Kyiv time.:Snopes asked the person behind that Twitter account where they had first come across the footage, but we have not yet received any response:Ultimately, we cannot rule out the possibility that the ""mic touch"" footage was authentic and Zelenskyy's staff effectively smuggled it onto the internet. Indeed, if Zelenskyy's staff did leak footage that included the ""mic touch"" moment, that fact might remain publicly unconfirmed for some time. Another confounding consideration here: If Zelenskyy did wish to take a sly dig at Putin, why make that symbolic gesture, only to then cut it from the official video, but subsequently leak it into public view anyway, via a back channel on to the internet? The ""mic touch"" footage appears to have been authentic, though we cannot definitively confirm that, and we have not yet identified how it ended up on the internet. However, if it was recorded at the same time as Zelenskyy's March 5 video message, then it might well be a sly reference to the ""Putin green screen"" theory from earlier that day. Putin met with the airline staff earlier on the afternoon of March 5. References to the meeting, along with screenshots and clips, began to appear online at around 4 p.m. Ukrainian time on March 5 -- more than five hours before Zelenskyy's video was posted. It should be noted that we don't know when Zelensky's video was recorded, but assuming it was shortly before it was posted, that would leave plenty of time for Zelenskyy and his staff to become aware of the rumor about Putin's hand ""passing through"" a microphone, and decide to make a reference to it. :This sequence of events doesn't allow us to come to a conclusion about the authenticity and motivations behind the gesture, but it is at least useful in clarifying certain possibilities. For example, if we knew with certainty that the footage of Zelenskyy was recorded before Putin had his meeting with the airline staff, then we could definitively rule out the possibility that Zelenskyy was making a satirical reference to a later conspiracy theory.As it turns out, we don't know when the video was recorded, so all reasonable possible explanations remain on the table, and our rating remains ""Unproven,"" for now.

405,405,580.HillaryClintonWasRes,"Claim:Hillary Clinton was responsible for the siege on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, that ended with 76 civilian deaths.Rating:FalseAbout this rating As Hillary Clinton has risen to become one of the two people most likely to be the next president of the United States, so too have various legends and rumors implicating her in the deaths of everyone from Vince Foster to John F. Kennedy Jr. The latest rumor to crop up in 2016 is an accusation (which appears on conspiracy theory web sites under titles such as ""WOMAN POWER: HILLARY CLINTON GAVE ORDER TO MURDER WACO BABIES"" and ""It Takes a Clinton to Murder a Village: Hillary Clinton Ordered Waco Massacre That Lead To The Death Of Woman And Children"") holding that Hillary Clinton issued the order that resulted in the deaths of 76 religious cult members at the Branch Davidian compound in 1993.:When the FBI and other law enforcement agencies began their fateful 51-day standoff with a religious cult in Waco, Texas, known as the Branch Davidians on 28 February 1993, Bill Clinton had just taken office as President a month earlier. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was the lead agency on the issue, directing law enforcement operations during the standoff that started on a Sunday when agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) attempted to serve an arrest warrant on the group's leader, Vernon Howell (better known by an assumed name, David Koresh):On February 28, 1993, at approximately 9:30 a.m. Central Time, agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) came under heavy gunfire while attempting to execute an arrest warrant for Vernon Howell, otherwise known as David Koresh. The warrant authorized Koresh's arrest for federal firearms and explosives violations. An accompanying search warrant authorized the ATF agents to search the compound where Koresh and his followers, known as the Branch Davidians, lived near Waco, Texas. Four ATF agents were killed and sixteen were wounded during the shootout with the Branch Davidians on February 28. Additionally, a number of individuals inside the compound were killed and injured; however, the number killed by ATF gunfire cannot be precisely determined.:Within a few hours of the incident, and at the request of ATF officials, the FBI dispatched trained negotiators to the scene in Waco. By that afternoon, the FBI, in cooperation with the ATF and Department of Treasury officials, had also sent in advance units of its elite Hostage Rescue Team. The next day (March 1, 1993), also at the request of Treasury Department officials, the FBI became the lead agency responsible for resolving the standoff with the Branch Davidians.The Branch Davidians, an offshoot of the Seventh Day Adventists, strongly believed that the Second Coming of Christ was imminent, and that the end of the world was approaching rapidly. The Davidians had armed themselves heavily in anticipation of an apocalyptic showdown with government agents, who they likened to the Babylonians and Assyrians of Biblical times. David Koresh had been the ""prophet"" or leader of the Davidians since 1987.When the FBI assumed responsibility for resolving the standoff, it faced an unknown number of men, women, and children who had barricaded themselves in a large compound, and who refused to surrender. They were heavily armed with hundreds of weapons, including fully automatic machine guns and .50 caliber rifles, and with hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition. They had already demonstrated their willingness to use those weapons on February 28.:During the next 51 days, over 700 law enforcement personnel participated in the effort to end the standoff. Between 250 to 300 FBI personnel were present in Waco at any given time, along with hundreds of officers and agents from other federal, state, and local agencies.The standoff finally ended on 19 April 1993, when the FBI attempted the expected non-lethal solution of introducing nonlethal tear gas into the compound and the Davidians responded by setting fire to the compound, culminating in a shootout with ATF agents:Seven weeks after the standoff began, the Attorney General approved an FBI request to introduce nonlethal tear gas into the compound. The Attorney General based her decision on a number of factors, including the impasse in the negotiations, the extreme difficulty in maintaining a safe and secure perimeter around the compound, the risk of disease caused by deteriorating sanitary conditions in the compound, the remaining Davidians' refusal to leave any time in the foreseeable future, and the Davidians' ability to hold out for many more months, given their large stockpiles of food and water.The Attorney General and her senior advisers, with input from the FBI and the U.S. military, reviewed several options before concluding that inserting tear gas was the only viable, non-lethal option. The plan was to insert gas periodically over a 48-hour period, to then withdraw, and then to wait as large numbers of people left the compound. The Attorney General approved the operation on Saturday, April 17, ordering that it be implemented beginning Monday, April 19.:On April 19, the FBI telephoned the compound at 5:59 a.m. to inform the Davidians that tear gas would be released into the compound, and to assure them that the FBI was not launching an assault. At 6:02 a.m., an FBI tank with an attached boom began inserting gas into the compound. The Davidians opened fire on the FBI's vehicle within two minutes.At 12:07 p.m., the Davidians started simultaneous fires at three or more different locations within the compound. This was established by a team of independent arson experts; by video shot from an aircraft utilizing Forward Looking Infrared Radar (FLIR) technology; by observations of FBI agents who saw an individual appearing to light one of the fires; by statements from survivors admitting that the Davidians set the fires; and by [material redacted as required by statute]. The fires rapidly engulfed the compound in flames and smoke.At approximately 12:25 p.m., the FBI agents closest to the compound heard what they described as ""systematic"" gunfire. Many agents believed at the time that those inside were killing themselves, killing each other, or both.The remains of 75 individuals (50 adults and 25 children under age 15) were recovered in the ruins of the compound. At least 17 of those individuals died of gunshot wounds, including several children. Another child was stabbed to death. In addition to the 75 persons who died during the April 19 fire, five other bodies, all with gunshot wounds, also were recovered. Those five bodies were of the Davidians presumably killed during the February 28 shootout with the ATF. Some of those five bodies showed evidence of having been shot from inside the compound. At least one of those five bodies showed evidence of suicide.:So how could Hillary Clinton have been responsible for this bloody event?  The only answers come from fringe conspiracy sites, who improbably claim that she -- despite having no authority over the Department of Justice or any other law enforcement agency in her position as First Lady -- was even more improbably running the Waco operation and issued an order for the final assault on the compound to Attorney General Reno through Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster ... something apparently known only to Linda Tripp, a former U.S. civil servant White House employee:Appearing on CNN's Larry King Live, fmr. White House aide Linda Tripp suggested that Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster -- at Mrs. Clinton's direction -- transmitted the order to move on the Branch Davidian compound, which culminated in a military style attack. ""Give me a reason not to do this,"" Janet Reno is said to have begged aides shortly before orders were issued in the final assault -- during which 85 Branch Davidians were burned alive.Tripp's allegations lend weight to charges made previously by Special Forces expert and Waco investigator, Steve Barry -- who claimed Hillary Clinton set up a special ""crisis center"" in the White House to deal with Waco.:The typical narrative of this conspiracy scenario bizarrely maintains that Hillary Clinton held enough sway to issue the order for an assault on the Waco compound because White House counsel Vince Foster was her ""longtime boyfriend"" and ""sexual partner,"" while Associate Attorney General Webster (""Webb"") Hubbell was the real biological father of Clinton's daughter Chelsea.  This scenario even more bizarrely claims that Clinton's putative motivation for issuing the order was that she was disgruntled over the Branch Davidian issue's hogging all the headlines while she was working to craft a healthcare reform package:Hillary was the one who ordered the FUBAR final assault on the holed-up Branch Davidians in Waco on April 19th, 1993. Hillary was putting pressure on Vince Foster (her longtime boyfriend, sexual partner and emotional husband) and Webb Hubbell who was the #3 guy at Justice Department, to have a forceful resolution to the Waco standoff. Webb Hubbell is also probably the father of Chelsea, not Bill Clinton.      One big reason Hillary placed Hubbell in the #3 spot at the Justice Department was so that he would not have to go through a Senate confirmation hearing where the ugly and probably true details about Hubbell being the biological father of Chelsea might be revealed in this process.Mrs Clinton grew more and more impatient as the Waco stand-off came to dominate the headlines. Hillary wanted to get so-called ""heath care reform"" done, and Waco was taking all the headlines in spring.:The Department of Justice (DoJ) oversees the FBI, and the attorney general heads the DoJ. At the time of the Waco incident the attorney general was Janet Reno, who  -- after consulting with the President and FBI officials -- gave the final approval for the assault on the compound (although the FBI maintained a great deal of leverage as the lead agency on the ground). A detailed Justice Department report described numerous FBI and Justice Department officials involved in the decision-making process that led up to the end of the siege -- but made not a single mention of Hillary Clinton or Vince Foster:From the time the standoff at the Branch Davidian compound began on February 28, the principal headquarters responsibility in Washington for planning and decision-making lay with the Terrorism and Violent Crimes Section of the Justice Department's Criminal Division (TVCS/CRM) and the Violent Crimes and Major Offenders Section (VCMOS) of the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division (CID). As the Chief of the TVCS/CRM, James S. Reynolds was substantially involved, as were both Deputy Chief Mary Incontro and section attorney John Lancaster. John C. Keeney was the Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division during the crisis, and Deputy Assistant Attorney General (DAAG) Mark Richard oversaw the activities of TVCS/CRM. AG Reno relied a great deal on DAAG Richard during the latter days of the crisis. The primary headquarters responsibility for decision-making throughout the crisis at the FBI lay with Director Sessions, Deputy Director Clarke, and Associate Deputy Director Gow.:The Attorney General believes she was adequately informed and that the FBI was forthcoming. She was impressed with the quality and timeliness of responses to her questions or to her requests for additional information. When she asked the FBI to seek input from the military, she was impressed that the FBI arranged a face-to-face briefing within two days. The FBI did not try to ""railroad"" her. Instead, they were respectful and seemed genuinely appreciative of the hard questions she posed. She did not believe that anyone at the FBI deliberately played up the issue of child abuse. In any event, that was only one of the many factors she considered in deciding to approve the tear-gas plan. The FBI kept an open mind, and no one ever suggested to her that they knew best or that they knew it all.While the operation involved hundreds of law enforcement officers from numerous local, state and federal agencies, and its aftermath resulted in multiple investigations by both the government and news media, we found no credible evidence that one of the people involved in the multitude of decisions that were made concerning the standoff was Hillary Clinton."
406,406,601.MelGibsonInterviewfr,"In early July 2023, right around the release of the film, ""Sound of Freedom,"" a video interview from 1998 with actor and director Mel Gibson went viral on Twitter.One of the most popular tweets included a video that lasted three minutes and 10 seconds, and read, ""SHOCKING: Mel Gibson (Sound of Freedom) is the REAL DEAL. Warned about the evils of HOLLYWOOD in 1998. Predicted how they'd turn on him. Alludes to actors being actual demons. He knows something very dark & wants to EXPOSE it.

The seriousness in his voice is chilling pic.twitter.com/6l8Mu6LVxV-- E (@ElijahSchaffer) July 9, 2023:We reached out to Gibson's representation by email to ask about the interview but did not receive a response before publishing this story. This article will be updated in the future if any further details come to light.BackgroundBefore we get into the details of this viral video and its loud, spooky-sounding music that was added after its original broadcast by an unknown editor, we first should cover a few facts.First, the interview was recorded in Los Angeles on Aug. 25, 1998. The interviewer was British film director, producer, writer, and composer Mike Figgis. A poster for Gibson's 1997 film, ""Conspiracy Theory,"" is visible behind Gibson during the video, showing the words, ""The Paranoia Begins August 8.""The interview was recorded for ""Hollywood Conversations,"" in association with Red Mullet Productions, with the title, ""Mike Figgis in Conversation with Mel Gibson."" Figgis is perhaps best known for directing the 1995 film, ""Leaving Las Vegas."":Second, the brief clip of the interview that was being virally shared on Twitter was re-edited by an unknown person, apparently from a longer, previous re-edit that was posted in 2022. In the video, several parts of the interview were presented out of order when compared to the original broadcast. Many users on Twitter questioned the context of the video, a subject we'll cover in full in this story.Third, contrary to what some social media users appeared to believe, Gibson was not credited with directing, producing, writing, or apparently having anything to do with ""Sound of Freedom,"" which was released on July 4. According to IMDb.com, the film was directed by Alejandro Monteverde, written by Rod Barr and Monteverde, and had multiple producers, none of which was Gibson.The confusion that led some people to believe Gibson was involved in ""Sound of Freedom"" may have stemmed from the fact that the film starred Jim Caviezel, the same actor who portrayed Jesus Christ in the 2004 film, ""The Passion of the Christ."" Gibson directed, produced, and co-wrote the Biblical movie.Additionally, Gibson appeared in a video in which he urged viewers to go see ""Sound of Freedom"" in theaters, saying in part, ""One of the most disturbing problems in our world today is human trafficking, and particularly the trafficking of children."" This may have led some people to believe he was involved in the movie.:NEW: Mel Gibson is promoting 'Sound of Freedom' which is set to be released tomorrow July 4th, exposing the reality of child sex trafficking.""The most disturbing problems in our world today is human trafficking, and particularly the trafficking of children. Now, the first step... pic.twitter.com/Uf61Vk2Hew-- Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) July 3, 2023Gibson's mention of trafficking referenced the story behind ""Sound of Freedom,"" which centers on a former government agent and the rescue of children from sex traffickers.Social media users made several different claims about the viral interview video, such as the claim that he had exposed the ""evils"" of coming to Hollywood. At the same time, other users indicated that Gibson's words were carefully alluding to sex trafficking and pedophilia happening in the town, even though he did not specifically mention these topics. As such, rather than having readers concentrate on a single fact-check rating at the top of our story that provides a single answer for multiple claims, we've instead chosen to simply lay out all of the data that we have gathered, including our own transcription of Gibson's remarks.:SummaryIn what looked to be the original, 24-minute interview from 1998, Figgis asked Gibson about a range of topics. Those topics included questions about Gibson's options for careers coming out of high school, thoughts about asking actors to read for parts in casting sessions, the lack of ""decent"" film roles for women, the role of money in Hollywood, and the ""social contract"" that's associated with working in the town.As for the Twitter video that lasted just over three minutes, it presented several parts of the original interview out of order and in a way that may have stripped away some some context, not to mention the fact that the clip included loud, scary-sounding music.Gibson's Remarks in Context:The portions of the viral video from 0:00-2:03 and 2:56-3:10 came from near the end of the original, 24-minute interview with Gibson. During this part of the original interview, he appeared to be speaking about the idea of an actor becoming successful in Hollywood and then in the next instant being tossed out like yesterday's garbage, perhaps by the people you'd least expect to do such a thing.We have transcribed the context of this part of the interview below. We recommend watching the Twitter video above, then reading Gibson's full remarks below (or watching the entire interview). Again, bear in mind that not all of these clips were presented in the Twitter video in sequential order.The words that appear in bold reflect the portion of the remarks that appeared in the Twitter video:Figgis: Is there a collective ethos, or, somebody once said my problem was I didn't understand the social contract here [in Hollywood]. I now understand what that means. Do you understand it?:Gibson: The social contract? I think I do.Figgis: Yeah, what is it for you?Gibson: The social contract. You can't get mad. You can't get mad. You can't let it get you, because you have to have, you have to make a deal with everyone else, and it's almost unspoken, that you are going to be fucked over at some point by people who you may have done something nice for. And it may happen that by circumstance, or, even very purposefully, that you fuck someone over, but that shouldn't get in the way of you being about to sit down and have fun with them. Am I on the right track? You can't build a resentment about it. You have to still try and love those people, because that's the way they're thinking.Figgis: Is it very personal?Gibson: No, it's not personal. They don't really mean to hurt you. Not really. I don't quite understand, well, I mean there's a lot of motivations for why it happens. Many.Figgis: I mean, money will make you do stuff as well, won't it? I mean...:Gibson: Yes, yeah, well, whoever.Figgis: I mean, if there are many millions riding on a decision, it's hard to be philosophical.Gibson: Yes. Yeah, very, very hard. Very hard to be, you know, you have to choose what level of integrity you're coming in on. And I've often felt it. I've sat there and I have felt the knife slipped firmly through my shoulder blade and tried to have it shoved the other side through my heart. And I've actually felt the whole thing, and I've gone, ""Ahh."" (inaudible) Or, I'll think, ""Fuckin..."" And you'll resent it for a little while, and you have to let it go. Otherwise, you'll eat yourself alive. And I think it takes that kind of cockroach resilience to survive in this town. I mean, this is a bizarre place. And it doesn't take very long, and I'm sure you've experienced this if you've stayed here for any length of time. You come in. You're fresh from the outside. You're off the boat from the farm. Still got shit on your shoes. You're in here. People are charmed by that, that you've still got shit on your shoes. They're charmed by that fresh approach you bring to it. And that's a real thing. But they're also stroking the shit out of you, you know, licking you all over. And that's kind of good for you, too. But it doesn't take very long before you realize, or before it gets to you. It's cascading on you all the time. You can't get away from certain attitudes, from certain modes of behavior, that this town and the industry dictate. And no matter how strong you are, when you come in off the farm with those convictions and a certain line of attack, no matter how strong you are, you are going to be affected by this place. It's going to divert you from where you were going. You're going to be diverted. When I came over here, I was, oh God, I was in my mid-20s, the first time I really came over here. You know, I had a whole bunch of weird, paranoid suspicions, about what the hell was going on because there was a lot of stuff I couldn't understand.:Figgis: Right.Gibson: And nobody was really bothering to explain it to me.Figgis: They don't.Gibson: And, I formed a bunch of opinions about the town and about the people in it that were like, surely that couldn't be, because a whole place can't be like, you know, weird town, you know, where the stranger wanders in and all the people are in the bar and they all shut up when he looks at them, and they tell you don't go to the house on the hill. It's like that. And then you go away and you think, no, that's, I was wrong. That's insane thinking. I'm paranoid. I imagined that stuff. That couldn't be the reason for why so and so was acting like, could it? And then you find out later on the track that you were exactly on track with a lot of this stuff, not specifically on track, but that you could, that some of your worst nightmares were real at the time, and you think (shocked facial expression).And this is what I mean by actually starting to swim up or down stream with the rest of the salmon, eventually, if you stay here long enough. You'll find yourself doing that. And you have to... There's a way of doing it without doing it. That takes time. And it takes relaxation.:Figgis: Not being uncomfortable about...Gibson: Not being uncomfortable. Realizing it for what it is...Figgis: Projecting.Gibson: Understanding what it is. Once you understand it, well then you're not afraid of it anymore, so you can just walk around it and through it, and then get on with what you tried to get on with in the first place. A place like this can humiliate you, and it can be, it can either, it can humiliate you, it can be humbling. I mean, it does rip your life to pieces, if you'll let it. And it's always pounding at the walls. These little guys, these little heathens with no soul downstairs with horns on their head, with a battering ram trying to like, beat your walls in. But that's your own devils, you know?Figgis: As a matter of interest, do you think it's easier because you're an outsider who came in?Gibson: I think so, because it was glaring to me, because I was an outsider who came in. But who isn't an outsider coming into this?:Christopher WalkenThe last-remaining section of the viral video shared on Twitter covered the 2:03-2:56 marks.In an early part of the original interview, separate from the other discussions covered above, Figgis asked Gibson about how he deals with choosing actors to work with. The two men then both mentioned that they didn't prefer to ask actors to read lines during casting sessions, with Gibson comparing aspects of the practice to prostitution.During this section of the interview, Figgis mentioned actor Christopher Walken. Gibson then shared a story about meeting with Walken to see if he wanted to work with him. Gibson ended up saying to Figgis of his fellow actor, ""Oh no, Chris Walken is the Antichrist,"" a moment followed by laughs.As at least one Twitter user pointed out, Gibson's mention of ""Antichrist"" was possibly a reference to a movie. Earlier in 1998, Walken had starred in ""The Prophecy II,"" a film in which his character, Gabriel, is returned to Earth after being taken down to hell by Lucifer in the first film, according to TV Tropes.:Again, the bolded parts below were what appeared in the viral video that was shared on Twitter:Gibson: I was so far away from the technical aspects of reading and doing things within some parameter that is given in audition processes that, I thought it was hopeless anyway, so I thought, fuck it, threw it away, and was relaxed. And that's the best way to find out whether or not this actor or actress will suit your requirement, is to have them relax, and then you can talk about the fucking weather, and you'll know within 15 minutes.Figgis: If this is a person you want to work with.Gibson: Mmm hmm.Figgis: Yeah. Christopher Walken, the first time I ever did a casting session in America, terrified me.Gibson: Me too.:Figgis: Fucking (inaudible) I came to meet the guy. They said, oh he's flying in from God knows where. 500 miles.Gibson: Yeah, but he didn't need a plane, right? It was like...Figgis: He was doing all that kind of Scorcese stuff. And I said, have you had a chance to read the script? He looked at me and said, ""Do you like my face?"" And I went, ""Yes."" And he said, ""Well, that's fucking great, cause if you don't, get DeNiro. Fuck you. I'm outta here,"" and stood up and walked out. And everyone said, ""Well, I think that was quite a good meeting.""Gibson: No, he came to see me on a rooftop in New York. I said, ""Hey, can I talk to you?"" And he said, ""Sure."" He floated in sideways through a crowd of people. He was wearing black. And it was like one of those old vampire movies where they don't walk, but they glide. And he was a dancer, you know, so he's very graceful. And he moves sideways and he just sat down in a chair next to me. And it kind of frightened me. And he's a very smart guy. And we started talking, and I didn't say much of anything about the script. Nothing. I just started talking about the Middle Ages, and he began to talk tortures. And we swapped tortures, because I read this book on torture. And I tried to recall some of the most heinous things I'd ever read in this book, and he was like, ""Ahh, ohh,"" and he would try and top it. And my assistant was there, and he left because he couldn't stand it anymore. The air had turned cold. And then he left, and I wanted to leave, because I knew I didn't want to work with him. And he was getting scary. And then I turned around, and it was on top of the Peninsula Hotel. I turned around to avoid his steady gaze at one point. And I was looking at the building with the top of the 6's on it, so there was a huge, illuminated triple-6 in red, and I went from that to that to that, and he started smiling. And I thought, oh no, Chris Walken is the Antichrist (laughs).:Additional NotesAt the 12:10 mark in the original interview, a moment that didn't appear in the brief Twitter video, Gibson mentioned a ""successful producer"" who he said would remain unnamed. Gibson said of this producer, ""His whole opinion about women on film from beginning to end is very brief. He says, 'Women on film? Either naked or dead. Both is better.'""In another moment, the full context of which can be viewed beginning at the 8:52 mark here, Gibson answered a question about a shortage of stronger roles for women in film. He said, ""I think the male of the species is more adept at the telling of a story. That's why you go to any bar. It's not women telling jokes. It's guys telling jokes. Women are notoriously bad joke tellers, most of them. Some of them are good. Some of them have the capacity for it. But I think, just generally, men are better at it, at telling stories. And when they tell a story they have to, it has to issue from themselves and their own experience. And it's very hard if most of the storytellers around are men to actually have a good story about a woman."":Note: The full, 24-minute interview was also made available on a Vimeo account with Figgis' name."
407,407,465.WhenUSPoliticiansSpr,"The ongoing chaos in the aftermath of the November 2020 presidential election has no precedent in modern U.S. history.Against the grim backdrop of skyrocketing coronavirus cases, outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump has let loose a barrage of tweets throughout the days and nights following the election, promoting a baseless conspiracy theory that the race was rigged against him by a nationwide voter fraud scheme.To be clear, there was no such scheme. Trump's Democratic political rival, President-elect Joe Biden, won decisively in both ballots and electoral college votes. And Trump's own Department of Homeland Security released a statement describing the November 2020 election as ""the most secure in American history.""Nevertheless, Trump has as of Nov. 13, 2020, refused to acknowledge the reality of his electoral loss and has pumped out disinformation on Twitter, refusing to concede while executive branch agencies have failed to cooperated with Biden's transition team.:The chaos has been compounded by public officials' actions and use of social media to spread disinformation, putting the platforms' election integrity policies under the microscope.The experts we spoke to said that for a variety of reasons, these policies weren't as effective as they could have been in protecting the democratic process. But they also noted that political leaders are themselves responsible for spreading incendiary rhetoric during a sensitive period for both national security and public health.Here's what we learned.What the Platforms Did and How Well That WorkedThe major platforms, namely Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, were heavily criticized in the wake of the 2016 election, in which U.S. intelligence officials reported that Russian government operatives flooded the platforms with trolls, bots, and ads carrying disinformation in an effort to help Trump.:Come 2020, these platforms were armed with policies in place for Election Day. Twitter, Trump's favored means of mass communication, covered many of his inflammatory and false tweets with a cautionary message about misleading information and limited their reach.Facebook took down a large group dedicated to the conspiracy theory that the election was stolen. Both Facebook and YouTube said they would block political advertising temporarily, while YouTube carried a display panel above election-related searches containing verified information.The platforms are getting better at addressing specific false claims, said Darren Linvill, associate professor in communications at Clemson University who researches state-sponsored disinformation, in an interview with Snopes. Problematic online movements, however, still flourish on the platforms, ""hence post electron is going not so well.""In the days following the election, Trump's followers turned up at vote counting centers during tabulations, banging on windows and chanting, ""stop the count"" or ""count the vote,"" which led to election workers feeling threatened.:Facebook took down a Stop the Steal group with hundreds of thousands of members for trying to incite violence, but as The New York Times reported, in some respects it may have been too late. The group ""had done its work. In its brief life span, it became a hub for people to falsely claim that the ballot count for the presidential election was being manipulated against President Trump.""Once the election was called for Biden, Twitter reverted to handling Trump's account under its policy for world leaders, which meant that with the exception of calling for violence, tweets that would otherwise be taken down under the platform's terms of service were left up because Twitter viewed doing so as being in the public's interest.Instead of limiting the tweets' reach, Twitter had labeled them with a link leading to verified information that stated, ""This claim about election fraud is disputed."" Here's an example::Trump's post-election disinformation campaign wasn't just harmful. It demonstrated why social media use by all public officials needs to be regulated, said Jennifer Grygiel, a social media expert and associate professor of communications at Syracuse University.Grygiel noted that the way many public officials and government agencies, from the federal to the local level, use social media presents a risk to the public wellbeing and to democracy because it gives them the ""ability to circumvent the free press and steer public opinion that aligns with the government.""That's not good for democracy, even if a public official uses social media respectfully, Grygiel noted, because as the number of news outlets shrink and government social media accounts gain followers and influence, the possibility arises that the public could become inundated with unchecked government propaganda.""A conflict exists because those who are supposed to be tasked with regulating social media to make sure it doesn't harm the public are also getting elected by using social media,"" Grygiel said. ""We need to start making sure that an elected official is not able to abuse social media to harm the public and ensure the ability of the free press to hold them accountable.""It's not a Republican issue, either. Grygiel pointed out that other public officials are famous for effectively using social media, like U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.:But, Grygiel added, ""No one really expected the president of the United States to be the major spreader of disinformation.""Jessica Feezell, associate professor of political science at the University of New Mexico, pointed out why platforms like Twitter and Facebook are so tempting for politicians.Before the advent of social media, political figures had to pay for campaign ads or have something legitimate to report to the public in order to call a news conference. Now, Feezell said, public figures with large followings on social media can generate a great deal of attention for themselves with social media posts.""There's paid-for media and campaigns, and there's free media, and Twitter is just free media,"" Feezell said. ""When those posts get rebroadcast by mainstream and cable news, it goes even further. It's pretty remarkable.""It's powerful, she said, because public figures and government officials can frame the news by generating such noise on social media.:""If Trump can keep the news media's attention on [baseless claims of] fraudulent votes, people will continue to think in their daily lives that 'fraudulent votes' are important,"" Feezell said. ""The entire front page is being sucked up by America's electoral politics at the moment.""The Call is Coming From Inside the (White) HouseIn 2016, disinformation campaigns using social media as the vector were largely run by the Russian government. But in 2020 they came directly from the White House and members of Congress. ""We're our biggest problem"" now, Linvill told us in a previous interview.Daniel Kreiss, director of media and communication at the University of North Carolina, told us that focusing criticism of disinformation on the social media platforms appears non-partisan, making it easier for journalists to point to. But noting Trump's failure to concede defeat, and the near-unity in Republican legislators endorsing the lie that mass-scale voter fraud took place and failing to acknowledge Biden as president-elect, Kreiss said the problem originates upstream from the platforms.:""The GOP has generally failed to embrace the legitimacy of the president-elect and have been willing to float questions about voter fraud -- it's all over the place, coming from GOP party elites themselves,"" Kreiss said. ""It's my opinion that Facebook and Twitter are downstream from this much greater political crisis. At the end of the day, if [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell refuses to come out and say Joe Biden is the president-elect, and the election was free and fair, there's nothing Facebook and Twitter can do about it.""We contacted McConnell's office with questions about why Republicans have largely failed to acknowledge Biden as president-elect, despite Trump's own administration stating that the 2020 election was secure. We didn't get a response in time for publication.Julia Hellwege, assistant professor of political science at the University of South Dakota, told us in a phone interview that she is concerned with the chipping away of norms and traditions that many in the U.S. have taken for granted for decades, but which buttress crucial aspects of democracy like the peaceful transfer of power.:""Under normal circumstances there would be a loser and a concession speech and we move on with our lives, not because they are written in to our Constitution, but because they are norms that are part of American and democratic values,"" Hellwege said. ""When we don't see this and instead we get uncertainty, that to me signals an erosion of these norms and values.""That erosion, Hellwege said, is dangerous.""We haven't seen it in this country, but we have seen it in other countries,"" Hellwege added. ""It's often what we see in countries that descend away from democratic systems. It's those small things that are the first to go -- democracy chips away slowly.""It's not just norms like concession speeches that got chipped away in 2020. Aside from driving the ""voter fraud"" disinformation campaign, Trump's White House has refused to cooperate with Biden's transition. Until now, a federal agency called the General Services Administration was unknown to many Americans. But it shot into the public consciousness when its administrator, Trump appointee Emily Murphy, refused to sign a letter of ascertainment that would allow the Biden team access to administration personnel and millions of dollars in funds to begin the transition process.:With coronavirus cases raging, Murphy's refusal to perform what was up until now an unremarkable bureaucratic task raised fears that her actions could hamper the incoming administration's efforts to deal with the ongoing public health crisis and endanger national security.""We are in the midst of the first presidential transition in the modern era to be conducted remotely. We are already facing pretty significant challenges, not just with the coronavirus pandemic, but with the fact that transitions in government are known to be periods of time when the threats of attacks from foreign actors are heightened,"" said Donald Sherman, deputy director of the government watchdog non-profit Citizens for Ethics in Washington. ""It's critically important for the national security apparatuses of the outgoing and incoming administrations to be working together in concert and communicating to ensure our national security infrastructure can make the decisions that need to be made and the president can make the decisions that need to be made on day one.""The Trump administration's actions in this regard are ""wildly irresponsible,"" Sherman said, and what Murphy is doing is ""reckless."":We reached out to the General Services Administration to ask what the reason was for the delay in allowing Biden's transition team access to funds and personnel, and a timeline for when that access would be granted. We received no response in time for publication."
408,408,681.DidPoliceinNCEscortP,"Claim:In June 2022, deputies from the New Hanover Sheriff's Office ""escorted"" far-right Proud Boys protesters towards an LGBTQ Pride event for children at a library in Wilmington, North Carolina. Rating:UnprovenAbout this rating Fact CheckIn June 2022, viral social media posts claimed that police in Wilmington, North Carolina, had ""escorted"" protesters from the far-right Proud Boys group towards an LGBTQ reading event for children, at a local public library.:For example, on June 22, trans rights activist Erin Reed posted several photographs to Twitter, along with the following description:Proud Boys stormed the Pine Valley Public Library in Wilmington, North Carolina. I did some research from people who witnessed things on the ground and took pictures, and it would seem that not only was the Sheriff's office ineffective - they ESCORTED the proud boys to the room!:Also on Twitter, @wapplehouse shared similar photos and wrote: the fucking Proud Boys showed up to a local Pride story time event today for 7 year olds and to the surprise of absolutely no one were escorted into the building and right to the room it was being held in by the [New Hanover Sheriff's Office].A spokesperson for the New Hanover Sheriff's Office (NHSO) firmly denied to Snopes that any officer had ""escorted"" the Proud Boys towards the event. The spokesperson told Snopes the agency had video footage which corroborated that assertion, but its public release was unlikely because of the demands of North Carolina state law. Either way, no one has so far made public any evidence that definitively establishes the truth of that law enforcement agency's role in the June 21 incident. As a result, we are issuing a rating of ""Unproven."" If relevant evidence becomes available, we will update this fact check accordingly. :What Happened When Proud Boys Protested the Pine Valley Library Pride Reading Time Event?The event in question was an LGBTQ ""Pride reading time"" for children, and took place at Pine Valley public library in Wilmington, North Carolina, on June 21. It was protested by local members of the Proud Boys, a far-right group. Earlier in June, several of that movement's leaders were charged with seditious conspiracy over their alleged role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. More broadly, the summer of 2022 had seen a rising tide of homophobia and transphobia in the U.S., with a particular rhetorical focus on purportedly protecting children from ""groomers"" -- a homophobic slur with a long and odious ancestry. The photographs and descriptions that formed the basis of viral ""police escort"" claims were originally published by Angie Smith Kahney, who was present at the library at the time of the protest. :In a series of Facebook and Instagram posts, she shared pictures of NHSO deputies talking with protesters, as well as walking and standing near them. In one, she wrote that the sheriff's deputies had ""led the Proud Boys and their entourage right through the library TO THE ROOM FULL OF CHILDREN...""Snopes put those allegations -- that police had ""escorted"" the Proud Boys into the library and/or towards the room where the event was taking place -- to Lt. JJ Brewer, a spokesperson for the NHSO. Brewer firmly denied them, saying ""That's 100 percent incorrect.""Rather, he said, an NHSO supervisor had endeavored to walk ahead of the crowd of protesters and make sure they could not enter the room where the Pride reading time event was taking place. According to Brewer, while the protesters were legally permited to enter the main library building, they would have needed to be properly registered, and accompanied by children, in order to attend the event itself. He added that none of the protesters ever entered that room, nor did they attempt to enter it, and ""at no time did they cause a disturbance in the library."":We asked Smith Kahney for her response to those assertions, but we did not receive a response in time for publication. However, in an earlier Facebook post, she insisted that the Proud Boys were indeed disruptive and intimidating inside the library, and shouted obscenities at children and their parents, and said it was library staff -- rather than sheriff's deputies -- who ensured the protesters did not have access to the room.Snopes also asked New Hanover County officials for their account of the events that took place at the Pine Valley library -- which is operated by the county -- on June 21. In a statement provided to Snopes, Linda Thompson, the county's chief diversity and equity officer, said the protesters only entered the library building after the reading event had concluded, although some attendees still remained inside the room:...After the Storytime program had ended, several members of the protesting group wanted to come inside. Anyone from the public is permitted inside the building as long as they are not actively protesting or disturbing other patrons, based on the library's code of conduct. The library director came inside with them and deputies quickly made their way to the door of Storytime, to ensure safety for library patrons and staff who were still in the room. The members of the protesting group were not allowed in the closed room where the event had been held and families were still in, and there was no disturbance inside the building. Sheriff's deputies and library staff also provided help to parents and kids who were still in attendance (some had left already) on where to exit the library following the event. Parents and children were not in danger at any time.:Video footage will likely be required in order to definitively answer questions about the NHSO's role in the incidents, and whether or not they ""escorted"" Proud Boys towards the event. So far, such footage has not been published, and it is not clear what actions and events are shown in the still images posted online by Smith Kahney.Brewer told Snopes that the sheriff's office did have such footage, and that it clearly demonstrated that deputies did not ""escort"" the protesters towards the room, so that they might intimidate or harass attendees at the Pride event. However, as Brewer himself pointed out, North Carolina has unusually strict rules around the publication of police bodyworn camera footage. Police, for example, cannot unilaterally release such footage, but a judge can authorize its release. Brewer told Snopes it was therefore not likely that the bodycam footage would imminently be made public. Until or unless relevant evidence does become available, our rating remains ""Unproven."":"

A highly troubling ""urgent bulletin"" issued earlier today by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) states that it has received information from the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) warning to expect a ""radical change"" in the government of the United States, possibly within the next fortnight, based on information they have received from ""highly placed"" sources within the Pentagon.According to this MoFA bulletin, GRU intelligence assests were notified by their Pentagon counterparts this past week that President Barack Obama is preparing to invoke the powers given to him under 50 USC Chapter 13 to hold that various American States are now in a ""state of insurrection"" thus allowing him to invoke the National Emergencies Act under 50 USC SS 1621 and invoke the highly controversial ""continuity of government"" plan for the United States allowing him, in essence, to rule with supreme powers.https://www.eutimes.net/2013/10/pentagon-warns-to-expect-radical-change-in-us-government-soon/:   Origins:   This October 2013 item about ""highly placed"" sources in the Pentagon supposedly warning Russian officials to expect a ""radical change"" in the U.S. government isn't a real news item; it's just more fictional ""Sorcha Faal"" sensationalism that originated with a single disreputable source, the whatdoesitmean.com political conspiracy site, of which  RationalWiki says:Sorcha Faal is the alleged author of an ongoing series of ""reports"" published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don't think much of it. Each report resembles a news story in its style but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don't contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish.Previous examples of WhatDoesItMean.com nuttery include a May 2013 report that Russian President Vladimir Putin had threatened U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry with a world war over a ""bee apocalypse"" supposedly caused by American agricultural biotechnology corporations.  :It stretches credulity to the extreme to imagine that if a U.S. president were imminently planning to declare a ""state of insurrection"" existed within the U.S. and invoke the National Emergencies Act (especially to the extent that Pentagon sources were issuing warnings to foreign officials about such plans), there wouldn't be a single mention of this monumental development anywhere in the American or global news media.  Unfortunately, other political conspiracy sites which have more professional-appearing names and layouts than whatdoesitmean.com, such as the European Union Times, republish the former's fantastic ""Sorcha Faal"" reports, creating the misleading impression that such material is being reported by multiple legitimate news sources.As RationalWiki notes of the European Union Times:The European Union Times strays deeply into tinfoil hat territory. For example, it regularly re-publishes the hilarious ""reports"" of ""Sorcha Faal."" If you see a headline that is really ""out there"" (for example, ""US Earthquake Weapon Test Fails Again, Destroys New Zealand City""), scroll to the bottom and have a look at the ""Source"" link. If it points to whatdoesitmean.com, it's the handiwork of ""Sorcha"".

411,411,445.WastheManchesterTerr,"Claim:The suicide bombing attack at the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England was a hoax.Rating:FalseAbout this rating OriginOn 22 May 2017, various conspiracy theories began to emerge on the Internet pushing narratives that a suicide bombing attack that killed 22 people at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England was either a hoax or a ""false flag"" -- a mass tragedy staged by the government (or governments) to manipulate the public.:One such widely-shared video was posted to YouTube the same day of the attack, and has since been viewed thousands of times. In it, a male narrator concludes that the attack was a hoax, because he takes at face value the words of an announcer who was trying to calm a panicked crowd at Manchester Arena by assuring them there was no need to run in the aftermath of the explosion.An archived copy of the conspiracy video can be viewed on the Wayback Machine:https://web.archive.org/web/20170523181833/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vhw9zunZLkIn footage from a camera phone taken inside the arena immediately after the bomb exploded, the announcer's voice can be heard urging calm. He says:Ladies and gentleman, please take your time. There's no need to bunch up. There's no problems here. Just take your time and exit the building. There's no need to bunch up and run. Take your time, there's no problems here. Thank you for coming and having a good time tonight. Everything is fine. Just take your time in exiting the building. Thank you very much. Walk slowly, there's no need to run.:Me and a friend trying to exit Manchester Arena while the staff were telling everyone to keep calm and not run #scary #arianagrande pic.twitter.com/r9GFZpOe4D-- alex (@butterywig101) May 22, 2017The explanation for the announcer's verbiage is simple. After the explosion, footage from inside Manchester Arena shows panic, with people running for the building's exits. This is recipe for a stampede, and the announcer was trying to prevent that from happening -- and may well have succeeded. After posting the video in which the announcement can be heard, the same Twitter user said people did slow down in order to listen to him:We were trying to get out as quick as possible but people were stopping to listen to he announcement so it was difficult to-- alex (@butterywig101) May 22, 2017:But the narrator of the conspiracy video took the announcer's words literally, saying that by directing people not to crowd and panic, he inadvertently revealed nothing had actually happened:Supposedly 19 killed, 50 injured by a massive explosion, and this man says over the P.A. 'don't panic, don't run, don't bunch up, there's no problem here.' See the problem here? This is nothing but a fabricated hoax, and this of course, this audio he's saying wasn't meant to be captured of course and to be put out for public consumption. It doesn't jive of course with the narrative that this was a of course terrorist attack... 'Everything is fine.' And everything is fine... This is an open and closed case, right off the bat.The conspiracy video's narrator states his belief that the attack was staged as part of a series of fake tragedies to control the masses. This is demonstrably false. Greater Manchester Police confirmed that they have spoken to grieving families of the 22 deceased and that the coroner is performing postmortem examinations. Once this is complete, identities of the victims will be made public. Police are actively investigating the attack and have taken multiple people into custody. There is also ample footage taken by concert goers that shows everything from the moment the bomb exploded to people scrambling for safety. Authorities have identified the suicide bomber as 22-year-old Salman Abedi, a British citizen who had been on their radar for his extremist views.:In an e-mail, Manchester police panned the suggestion the attack was a hoax. They told us:We are currently dealing with a live investigation into the attack which has left 22 innocent people dead. We take great offence to any suggestion that the attack on the Manchester Arena is some sort of 'false flag' or 'drill', as I'm sure the rest of the people of Manchester and the families of the victims would.Another iteration of the conspiracy theory was posted by notorious fake news-generating web site, YourNewsWire. The post pushes the baseless ""false flag"" conspiracy that the British government knew about the attack beforehand and even practiced for it days earlier but did nothing to prevent it, as evidenced by a terror attack drill at Manchester mall days earlier:British intelligence and law enforcement were aware of plans to kill as many people as possible at the O2 Arena in Manchester, but rather than apprehend the terrorist, they let him kill 19 people, and the death toll may yet rise.Britain's open borders have provided the elite with the useful terrorists necessary to do their dirty work for them. British intelligence and law enforcement 'allowed' this attack to happen in order to justify cracking down on the innocent population even further, taking away more and more civil liberties, until we are living in a police state.:As ""evidence"" the article points to a year-old video from RT (formerly Russia Today, a Kremlin-funded television station) that depicts a drill conducted by police at Trafford Centre in Manchester the evening of 9 May 2016. But YourNewsWire either misread the year, or is deliberately misleading readers by claiming that the drill occurred ""less than two weeks"" before the 22 May 2017 suicide bombing attack at the concert:Less than two weeks after RT posted footage of crisis actors preparing for a terrorist attack in Manchester, a radical Islamic terrorist carried out a bloody attack on young girls, and it was allowed to happen.Terrorists are walking freely into our countries and being allowed to perform barbaric acts that terrorize good, law-abiding citizens. In some cases law enforcement and intelligence actually assist the terrorists.According to The Guardian, the 2016 drill was meant to mimic similar attacks in Paris and Brussels and included 800 volunteers. This is no surprise -- the terror threat level in the United Kingdom has been ""severe"" since 2014, which means authorities believed an attack was ""highly likely."" After the Manchester suicide bombing the level was raised to ""critical"" meaning an attack is ""imminent."" Practicing for the likely event of a terrorist attack in a country that has been on alert for that very thing is hardly suspect.:British authorities are actively investigating the Manchester attack and as of 24 May 2017 have taken seven people into custody as they work to head off further tragedies. There is no credible evidence supporting the claim the tragedy was a hoax or a ""false flag"", and YourNewsWire has a long track record of promoting false information."
412,412,26.ConspiracyWeary,"Claim:Singer Avril Lavigne died and was replaced by a doppelganger.Rating:FalseAbout this rating A bizarre theory claiming that singer Avril Lavigne died and was replaced with a doppelganger has been circulating online since the idea was first offered by the Portuguese-language blog ""Avril Esta Morta"" (Avril Is Dead) back in 2012; in October 2015, a reader asked:There is a rumor that Avril Lavigne is actually dead and that her doppelganger ""took over"" as her. Is this real? Or is it just a whole bunch of bs?:Since then, a ridiculous amount of ""evidence"" has surfaced to prove that the person currently posing as Avril Lavigne is an impostor. Song lyrics were analyzed, photographs were examined, and soon the conspiracy theory was propagated by web sites such as God Like Productions::Too bad I can't post the link here because it certainly will get me banned LOL, but it's a VERY VERY well built website, probably made by a die-hard fan of Avril Lavigne, and the author of the article scrutinized several details of her career to came to a conclusion that the Canadian singer hanged herself before the second album and was replaced by a doppelganger, who left several clues about the death of the original Avril, in the lyrics and covers of the next albums. Some lyrics are pretty blatant by the way! I quoted the verses that highlight a possible suicide! According to the article's author, she killed herself after she went home and found out that her parents abandoned her.Nobody's Home:Open your eyes and look outside, find the reasons why. You've been rejected, and now you can't find what you left behind. Be strong, be strong now. Too many, too many problems. Don't know where she belongs, where she belongs. She wants to go home, but nobody's home. It's where she lies, broken inside. With no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes. Broken inside.:Her feelings she hides. Her dreams she can't find. She's losing her mind. She's fallen behind. She can't find her place. She's losing her faith. She's fallen from grace. She's all over the place. Yeah,ohThe elaborate theory was even broken down by popular publications such as Vice and Gawker, and soon fans of the singer started questioning whether or not she was alive.But in July 2015 the ""Avril Esta Morta"" blog admitted that the theory was completely fabricated as an object lesson in internet misinformation and rumor:Avril is not dead...The blog was a way to show how conspiracy theories can seem real. Many people believe everything they see on the internet, but is it right? There are many conspiracy theories about many things, but some seem no more convincing than theories that are not real. Avril Lavigne never died and was replaced by a lookalike, I created this theory to see if people would believe it, and thousands of people believed it was a fact. An important point is that I created this theory with no intention of lying; all I did is offer arguments that anyone could search for information about and prove. I used information to form a real theory that is in fact unreal. I apologize to people who believed that she was dead and feel disappointed about this revelation, but this was an exercise to teach to become more skeptical cand not believe everything you see! It was never my intention to offend anyone, just to create a theory and test people's reaction to it. You will observe I left some clues that it was all just a theory and not a fact, for example when in the beginning of the blog I referenced the ""supposed death of the singer Avril Lavigne."" In other words, it is just a guess! If you want to believe that she is dead, that is your choice, but I say that it was all just a theory created by me.:Unfortunately, the damage was already done. The above-quoted update was only ""liked"" 500 times within six months of its original publication. The Vice article, on the other hand, has been shared tens of thousands of times.As such, a number of Avril Lavigne's fans still believe that she passed away and was replaced with a doppelganger:I watched a creepy conspiracy video last night about how Avril Lavigne is actually dead and I'm still freaked out-- jacey (@jacerain) November 5, 2015I kinda believe avril lavigne is really dead -- santa baby (@shaghennessy) November 5, 2015So apparently Avril Lavigne is dead, and has been replaced by a look a like named Malissa.-- white cheddar (@Duda1Hayley) November 5, 2015:After reading theories about how Avril Lavigne is dead, I'm convinced this is true -- princess (@Arianaspoon) November 4, 2015In summation, there is no truth behind the theory that Avril Lavigne killed herself and was replaced by an actress. This theory was created with the sole purpose of proving how easy it is to spread misinformation on the Internet.Well, mission accomplished."
413,413,231.DidRogerStoneSayTrum,"Claim:In September 2020, Roger Stone said U.S. President Donald Trump should, if he loses the November election, declare martial law. Rating:Correct AttributionAbout this rating Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.In September 2020, readers asked Snopes to examine the accuracy of news articles that claimed that Roger Stone, a Republican strategist and convicted felon who worked for U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 presidential election campaign, had said the president should declare martial law in the event that he loses the 2020 election. :On Sept. 11, 2020, left-leaning website Media Matters reported that: ""Roger Stone is making baseless accusations of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election and is urging Donald Trump to consider several draconian measures to stay in power, including having federal authorities seize ballots in Nevada, having FBI agents and Republican state officials 'physically' block voting under the pretext of preventing voter fraud, using martial law or the Insurrection Act to carry out widespread arrests, and nationalizing state police forces.""The following day, HuffPost published an article with the headline ""Roger Stone Calls For Trump To 'Declare Martial Law' To Seize Power If He Loses,"" and on Sept. 13, Business Insider reported that:""In an interview with Alex Jones' far-right conspiracy-theory site, Infowars, Stone echoed groundless claims pushed by Trump that the Democratic Party would rig the election. Stone encouraged Trump to consider declaring 'martial law' should he lose reelection, or invoke the Insurrection Act. Using those new powers, Stone suggested, he should order the arrest of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, 'the Clintons,' and 'anybody else who can be proven to be involved in illegal activity.'"":Those reports quoted Stone accurately. On Sept. 10, 2020, Stone appeared as a guest on Jones' show, where the two men, without providing supportive evidence, presented a somewhat convoluted conspiracy theory of a left-wing attempt to ""steal"" the Nov. 3 election.It's worth noting that in November 2019, Stone was convicted on seven felony counts of witness tampering, lying to and obstructing a Congressional committee, in relation to his role as a go-between with Wikileaks for the Trump campaign, around the time of a high-profile dump of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee. He was sentenced to 40 months in prison, but Trump commuted his sentence in July 2020.According to Jones and Stone, the 2020 election plot involved Democratic officials, the Democratic party, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, and former U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton, as well as tech CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook. Stone speculated that former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, and even the staff of The Daily Beast news website, could be parties to the conspiracy. Neither Stone nor Jones presented solid evidence to support their claims. :At one point in the interview (about 80 minutes into the episode), the following exchange took place:Jones: What does Trump need to do, with [sic] 53 days out? Because it's clear they think they can steal it, they've said they're going to oppose it, Big Tech -- Zuckerberg says they're going to launch it for weeks or months, hold it up. I mean that's their plan, how do we counter this?Stone: The president should call former Congressman Bob Barr, and he should ask him -- he should appoint him a special counsel, he should order his appointment as a special counsel with the specific task of forming an election day operation using the F.B.I., federal marshals and Republican state officials across the country, to be prepared to file legal objections and if necessary, to physically stand in the way of criminal activity. Jones: Exactly, and the whole Democrat strategy is if federal officers or locals enforce election law, that's criminal and that's blocking votes, when they have bombed the country with 80 million basically fake ballots to gum things up on purpose. And the Clintons are now, as you said, chortling, admitting that they have a military plan, once the election is in question, to remove Trump. Is that wishful thinking? Or do they have a small cadre and they're trying to act powerful? What's the plan?:Stone: I don't want to overplay the facts here, but if someone will study the president's authority in the Insurrection Act and in his ability to apply -- impose -- martial law if there's widespread [inaudible, might be ""cheating""], he will have the authority to arrest Mark Zuckerberg, to arrest Tim Cook, to arrest the Clintons, to arrest anybody else who can be proven to be involved in illegal activity. So Stone said Trump could, and should, under the auspices of martial law and the Insurrection Act, order the arrest of anyone suspected of orchestrating election fraud. According to Stone, the occurrence of election fraud will be made clear by the event of a Trump defeat. Later in the interview, he stated that:""Force will be met with force. That's the way this is going to have to work. It's really unfortunate, I'm not an advocate of that. I'd like to have an honest election in which the real winner takes office. The real winner will not be Joe Biden...""Therefore, by prejudging the result of the election -- stating that a Trump defeat would be de facto proof of widespread election fraud -- Stone was in effect saying that the president, if he loses, could and should, under the auspices of martial law and the Insurrection Act, arrest and charge certain prominent figures with election fraud. The news articles referenced above therefore quoted and reported Stone's remarks accurately.:"

It doesn't appear on his Twitter timeline on Dec. 18, 2020, nor can it be found in a searchable database that archives all of his tweets, or a database listing his deleted tweets.The fake tweet appears to play on calls by some Trump supporters for Trump to invoke martial law and order the military intervene in the 2020 presidential election over a conspiracy theory that the vote count was skewed by massive fraud. Proponents of the theory claim that Trump, not President-elect Joe Biden, won the election.News reports circulated in mid-December 2020 saying that Trump had toyed with the idea of invoking martial law in a heated meeting inside the White House, which drew a backlash, including from U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who called it ""embarrassing.""Trump responded on Dec. 19, 2020, by claiming on Twitter that reports he had considered invoking martial law were false: :Trump lost to President-elect Joe Biden by more than 7 million votes and 74 Electoral College points.

Amateur Radio and MARS organizations will take part.""This exercise will begin with a national massive coronal mass ejection event which will impact the national power grid as well as all forms of traditional communication, including landline telephone, cellphone, satellite, and Internet connectivity,"" Army MARS Program Manager Paul English, WD8DBY, explained in an announcement.""We want to continue building on the outstanding cooperative working relationship with the ARRL and the Amateur Radio community,"" English said. ""We want to expand the use of the 60-meter interop channels between the military and amateur community for emergency communications, and we hope the Amateur Radio community will give us some good feedback on the use of both the 5-MHz interop and the new 13-MHz broadcast channels as a means of information dissemination during a very bad day scenario.The date the training exercise was to begin coincided with a conspiracy theory which apparently originated with an amateur video from Kansas bounty hunter Jordan Peltz (who, despite the patch ironed onto his shirt, is not a law enforcement official). In the video, he warned -- without any supporting evidence -- that ""antifa"" had been planning a violent ""Day of Rage"" for 4 November 2017::Paul English, the Army MARS program manager quoted in the press release, confirmed to us that it was a pre-planned training exercise:Yes the ARRL announcement about this exercise is legitimate. The coronal mass ejection scenario is simulated ... notional. Resulting from the CME is the simulated...notional power and communication outages. These events are all notional ... simulated.

The announcement released on October 24 has not been widely distributed to the media, because the drill is simulating a total grid collapse and could spark public fear ...Bizarrely enough ... the US Department of Defense (DOD) training exercise will occur on ANTIFA's day of rage across the United States.Readers also asked about different variations of the rumor on Facebook and Twitter, most of which claimed that an extended loss of power would occur:Please hurry with this one.

No, we did not plan this to coincide with any particular protest. The date for COMEX 17-4 was set more than a year in advance. Keeping track of the various protest groups calendar of events is more than a little out of our lane.d. Yes, will will actually practice a solar storm scenario, go off the air, protect our radio equipment. After the notional storm, we will practice using emergency power (at least for a little while just to say we can, but not long enough to waste gasoline since the electrical service will actually still work), and of course establish radio contact with Amateur Radio Operators throughout the United States.e.

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. Key Facts:There is no verifiable evidence that COVID-19 vaccines have killed, or will kill, more military personnel than the disease itself.Dr. Lee Merritt, a self-described Navy surgeon, stated during an August 2021 lecture that based on the number of reported cases of myocarditis following vaccinations in the U.S. military, the vaccines have killed more young active duty personnel than COVID-19 has.It is true that myocarditis has been recorded as a rare but potentially serious effect following the receipt of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine both in civilians and in military personnel. However, the likelihood of experiencing a serious case of myocarditis is low, and health experts say the benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential risks of infection. Furthermore, patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were 16 times more likely to develop the inflammatory condition than those without COVID-19 -- a statistic health officials argue makes the case for getting vaccinated. As of this writing, more than 1.2 million service members had been fully vaccinated, and another 384,000 had received at least one dose. Of those enlisted in the military, 241,389 people have contracted COVID-19, resulting in 52 COVID-19-related deaths. :In the weeks following a federal mandate requiring that U.S. military personnel receive a full regime of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines, the internet was rife with misinformation surrounding the vaccines' safety and efficacy. A YouTube video posted on Aug. 28, 2021, claimed that a Navy surgeon had sounded the alarm about the alleged dangers of the vaccine, asserting that the COVID-19 vaccine has killed more military personnel than the disease itself. ""Navy surgeon has a warning. These numbers are in our military and very accurately tracked,"" reads the video's description. However, it does not state who the speaker is, the speaker's affiliation, the date of the speech, or the event at which the speech took place. The video garnered nearly a half-million views in the first month it was available online. In addition, it was widely shared on social media with a caption declaring,  ""The Vaccine Program has killed more active duty members than Covid19."" The video was posted just days after U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III issued a memorandum that mandated service members complete a regime of U.S.-approved COVID-19 vaccines. The speaker in question was identified by the social-video hosting website BitChute as Dr. Lee Merritt, an orthopedic surgeon affiliated with the fringe COVID-19 conspiracy theory group America's Frontline Doctors (AFD). And the video was first published on Aug. 26, after Merritt was speaking at AFD's one-year anniversary of the summit during a talk titled, ""What is VAERS and What Does it Show?"" (VAERS is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System maintained by the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services.) In the two-minute clip, the speaker vaguely referenced the VAERS system but did not show data on screen nor provide specific sources for her information. :We watched the entire 17-minute segment and transcribed the two-minute snippet shared to YouTube. This is what Merritt said about COVID-19 vaccines and the deaths of military personnel:One of my big problems is our vaccination of the military. I'm a 10-year Navy surgeon and so I have Navy people and Army people calling me. There were only 20 deaths of all the active duty in 2020 for COVID. Twenty in all the services put together. They have a big now -- that they didn't have when I was in -- they have a big epidemiologic base and they can find out exactly what's going on. There were only 20 deaths.We're vaccinating everybody and we've already had tumors and we've had 80 cases of myocarditis, which I'm going to get to, but myocarditis has significant mortality -- the 5 year mortality rate I think is 66%. So, with the vaccine program we have ostensibly killed more of our young active duty people than COVID did.Merritt's argument boils down to this: Based on the number of cases of myocarditis reported to VAERS following vaccinations in the U.S. military, the vaccines have killed more young active duty personnel than COVID-19 has. We'll evaluate her claims below.:Who Is Dr. Lee Merritt?Merritt is a licensed doctor in Nebraska whose LinkedIn profile described her as self-employed at Enlighten Omaha, a tattoo and hair removal facility. The online appointment booking platform Mindbody Online allowed users to book a ""Lee Merritt"" for services including ""acne scar treatment"" and hair removal. Before Enlighten Omaha, Merritt listed a five-year employment as an orthopedic and spinal surgeon at Stewart Memorial Community Hospital. (Her personal website, on the other hand, largely features misinformation about COVID-19 and a banner that points users to a message that reads, ""where to get hydroxychloroquine."") The only affiliation Snopes could find to link Merritt to the U.S. Navy was through her LinkedIn profile, which stated that Merritt attended a residency program for orthopedic surgery at a ""Naval Hospital"" in San Diego from 1983 to 1987. WebMD listed her education as a residency at the U.S. Naval Medical Center.Snopes contacted the center to confirm whether Merritt had attended a residency program but did not hear back in time for publication. We also reached out to the Military Health System, the Navy, and the Department of Defense to determine whether Merritt was affiliated with any branch of the military and to confirm details of her speech. On March 17, 2022, we received a response from the Defense Health Agency (DHA) noting that it plans to complete our information request by Oct. 31, 2022. DHA contributed the delay to ""a high volume of requests, limited resources, and the need to search for and collect records from a facility geographically separated from this office."":So, we did dig through the data available. What is Myocarditis? Myocarditis is a condition characterized by the inflammation of the heart while pericarditis, on the other hand, is an inflammation of the outer lining of the heart. In both cases, inflammation is the immune system's response to an infection or another trigger, according to a Sept. 6 statement issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).:Though it is rare, evidence suggests that there is a likely causal association between myocarditis and mRNA vaccines. The presence of a viral infection in the body is a common cause of myocarditis and such introductions can be made through vaccines. The CDC said it is actively monitoring reports of myocarditis and pericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination, and in August 2021, the agency released data that showed a small increase in cases of myocarditis after people received the Pfizer and Moderna two-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, especially in young adults and most often after the second dose. Cases usually presented within several days after vaccination but were mild and resolved on their own.Merritt's claims about myocarditis and its alleged relationship to vaccine deaths hold little merit, are purely speculative, and largely flawed. Here's why.In an analysis of data from nearly 900 hospitals, the CDC found that myocarditis in-patient encounters were 42.3% higher in 2020 than in 2019 -- but not because of the vaccine. Data released in early September showed that between March 2020 and January 2021, patients who contracted COVID-19 had nearly 16 times the risk for myocarditis when compared with those who had not been diagnosed with the condition, a statistic that health officials say highlights the importance of vaccines to prevent illness. :""During March 2020 - January 2021, the period that coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk for myocarditis was 0.146% among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during an inpatient or hospital-based outpatient encounter and 0.009% among patients who were not diagnosed with COVID-19,"" wrote the health agency. ""Overall, myocarditis was uncommon among persons with and without COVID-19; however, COVID-19 was significantly associated with an increased risk for myocarditis, with risk varying by age group.""  CDC: Reported Cases of Myocarditis in the MilitaryAs of this writing, military officials have not responded to Snopes' request for further data about the number of myocarditis cases reported from military vaccinations, and how many, if any, resulted directly in death. However, health experts note that though it is rare, myocarditis has been an observed side effect of some mRNA vaccines -- including the two currently authorized in the U.S. for COVID-19 -- with a majority of those cases observed in young males. The CDC notes that myocarditis has an overall incidence rate of about 40 cases per 1 million in vaccinated individuals. So, researchers writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) reviewed medical records from 40 hospitals to identify cases of myocarditis following vaccination. Of the more than 2 million vaccinated individuals studied, 20 developed myocarditis and an additional 37 developed pericarditis within 3.5 days after being vaccinated. Among those, 32 people were admitted to a hospital with three in the intensive care unit. No deaths from either condition were reported. Their analysis confirmed the CDC pattern; however, the researchers noted that myocarditis cases are likely underreported, given a majority of people will not go to the hospital if they are not experiencing life-threatening conditions, or if they do not require treatment. :Does that statistic also apply to the military? It's possible. Another retroactive analysis published in JAMA studied myocarditis rates in the Military Health System between January and April 2021. Of more than 2.8 million doses administered to military personnel, researchers found a total of 23 males (22 serving in the military and one retired at the time of the study's publication) with a median age of 25 sought medical attention within four days of their vaccine because they had ""marked chest pain."" All received brief supportive care and recovered or were recovering at the time of the report. Military members may also be more at risk of developing myocarditis after vaccination given their demographic. The CDC noted that myocarditis after mRNA vaccines occurs with the highest frequency following a second vaccine dose administered to males between 12 and 29 years, a population that the Council on Foreign Affairs says largely makes up the armed services. It's important to note that it has been established that mRNA vaccines, like those for smallpox and influenza, as well as traditional live viral vaccines, have a causal relationship with myocarditis and pericarditis. It's been no secret that COVID-19 vaccines are among those linked. A briefing document by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from December 2020 recorded one case of myocardial infection that resulted in death, though it's not known if that was a military member, following a vaccination of Corminaty (previously Pfizer-BioNTech). Moderna also reported an association from the vaccine and myocarditis.:In short, it is true that myocarditis has been recorded as a rare but potentially serious effect following the receipt of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.  However, the likelihood of experiencing a serious case is low and health experts recommend the benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential risks of infection. Tracking Merritt's ClaimsThe U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) tracks COVID-19 vaccination and death rates in collaboration with the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, as well as the State Department and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. At the time of this writing, the agencies reported that more than 1.2 million service members had been fully vaccinated and another 384,000 had received a partial dose. Of those enlisted in the military, 241,389 people had contracted COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic (data includes Active Duty, Reserve, and National Guard).In her speech, Merritt stated that there were ""only"" 20 COVID-19 deaths ""in all the services put together"" in 2020. The DOD has reported that since the onset of the pandemic, 52 military personnel have died from COVID-19 (though that number nears 500 when factoring in civilians, dependents, and contractors affiliated with the department).:The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a national early warning system established in 1990 to detect possible safety concerns with vaccines licensed in the U.S. Co-managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FDA, the system has been a source of contention since the onset of the pandemic in large part due to its inherent flaws. As we have previously reported, VAERS accepts reports of adverse events after vaccination, but it does not establish a cause-and-effect relationship between symptoms and a vaccine. It is simply a public reporting tool that anyone can contribute.""VAERS collects data on any adverse event following vaccination, be it coincidental or truly caused by a vaccine. The report of an adverse event to VAERS is not documentation that a vaccine caused the event,"" noted the Department of Health and Human Services.To view potential deaths linked to any of the three COVID-19 vaccines currently available in the U.S., we searched through the VAERS system using the parameter of ""purchased by"" the military, which returned dozens of results.  (You can view the results by clicking this link, pressing the ""I Agree"" button at the bottom of the page, hit the ""Results"" tab, and then press the ""Request Form"" tab with the repopulated information).:Also, a search through the database specific to COVID-19 vaccine doses purchased by the military that resulted in death from myocarditis returned no results:  Screengrab/VAERS As we stated previously, many of these entries are rife with typos or factual incongruences that make them difficult if not impossible to independently verify against death reports. Take the entry below, for example. The vaccination date of an unnamed 75-year-old is listed as Dec. 30, 2020, but the date this alleged patient died occurred a month prior on Dec. 1. : VAERS In short, there is no way to verify the authenticity of the entries into the VAERS system. Though it is a violation of federal law to knowingly file a false VAERS report, we've seen similar unverifiable claims surface time and again. :We are awaiting more specific answers from military officials and will update this page when we have more information. Update [March 17, 2022]: Updated to include response from DHA."

In the aftermath of the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, that left 14 people dead on 2 December 2015 a photograph purportedly showing one of these ""crisis actors"" was posted on Facebook.While the above-displayed photograph does indeed show an actress with a fake gunshot wound, the image was not taken in 2015 and does not capture a ""crisis actor"" at work. The woman pictured is actress Kristen Bell, and the photograph was snapped several years prior to the San Bernardino shooting during the filming of a scene for NBC's popular sci-fi drama Heroes.Greg Beeman, an executive producer on Heroes, posted the image to his web site on 1 December 2008:Sadly -- as of this episode Kristen Bell departs the show -- we loved having her here. She is a pro and an all-around good egg. The scene where Sylar burns her body was her last scene in the series -- but I actually directed her on her last day of shooting. This was the scene at the rental car dealership from episode 10. When we wrapped that scene the Assistant Director announced that Kristen was finished in the series. There was a huge round of applause and weepy eyes all around. Tim Kring and Kristen had explored keeping her around longer -- and I know Kristen wanted to come back.There were potential storylines about pregnancies and babie ... But the truth is she has a very busy career with a lot of feature films, pilots and much else in the works. We had no official contract with her -- and she couldn't commit to exactly when she could return. And so it was decided that this would be the most exciting way to end her character. She will be missed.:This isn't the first time that this photograph of Kristen Bell has been tied to a violent event.

418,418,640.WasaHolisticDoctorKi,"Claim:Justine Damond became one of dozens of holistic doctors fighting ""Big Pharma"" who suspiciously died.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 16 July 2017, alternative health blogger Erin Elizabeth reported on her web site Health Nut News that Justine Ruszczyk (who primarily used her fiance's surname, Damond), a 40-year-old Australian woman living in the U.S. who was shot and killed in mid-July 2017 by Minneapolis police, was among a growing list of holistic doctors who had died under suspicious circumstances. That narrative was further twisted by the disreputable conspiracy site YourNewsWire with the headline, ""Holistic Doctor, Working Against Big Pharma, Shot Dead By Police."":Elizabeth compiled a list in 2016 of what she characterized as more than sixty holistic doctors that died between June 2015 and August 2016, asserting that the deaths were somehow connected. Although Elizabeth stopped short of saying who the culprit was, the implication was that the healers were being systematically killed because of their occupations.As we noted in May 2017, the tragedies are unrelated to each other -- there is no evidence of a conspiracy to wipe out holistic doctors. Elizabeth's list was a sloppy compilation of natural deaths, accidents and crimes. Ten of the people on the list, in fact, had no connection to holistic medicine. That didn't stop YourNewsWire (and others) from turning the Damond shooting into yet another tragedy blatantly exploited by conspiracy theorists:According to reports, the police who arrived (including the one who shot her) had their body cameras turned off.The well-known health and lifestyle coach, who was actively campaigning for people to take control of their lives and reject Big Pharma's crippling products, joins the long list of holistic doctors and healers who have been killed in suspicious or unsolved circumstances during the past two years.:There are subgroups of Americans who are disproportionately killed by police, but holistic healers as a group are not among them. African-American people and mentally ill people, for example, have higher likelihoods of being victims in such incidents. To say that Damond's death is the result of her occupation as a holistic healer is to disingenuously supplant a factual social problem with a fictional one. The Sydney, Australian native's 15 July 2017 death could be linked instead to an actual pattern in the United States in which civilians are extrajudicially killed while interacting with police officers.As of 24 July, 688 people have been killed by American law enforcement in 2017, according to the tracking site KilledByPolice.net. The web site tallied 1,162 law enforcement-related deaths in 2016. (Because the federal government has fallen short in tracking such killings, volunteers have stepped up to the plate with databases like Killed By Police and Fatal Encounters.)According to the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office, Damond did die from a gunshot wound to the abdomen, and her death was ruled a homicide. But contradicting the suspicion that Damond was the target of an assassination due to her alternative health practices, she herself dialed 911 at 11:30 P.M., because she heard what she believed to be a sexual assault outside her Minneapolis, Minnesota home -- and her call for emergency services ended with her death. :According to the Minneapolis Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which is investigating the incident, two Minneapolis Police Department officers, Matthew Harrity and Mohamed Noor, responded to the call. Harrity was driving and Noor was in the passenger seat. According to the BCA's preliminary investigation, Harrity said he was startled by a loud noise just as Damond approached the squad car. Noor opened fire through Harrity's open driver's side window, striking Damond in the abdomen.Further contradicting the notion that Damond's death was an assassination, both officers tried to revive her. They ""immediately exited the squad and provided medical attention until medical personnel arrived,"" according to the BCA. The case is part of an ongoing -- and wrenching -- public discourse over police killings. Neither Harrity or Noor's body cameras filmed the shooting, nor did the squad car's camera. Police killings of people like Philando Castile, Eric Garner, Mike Brown, Manuel Diaz, and Kelly Thomas have resulted in civil unrest in recent years.:Almost exactly one year before Damond's death, St. Anthony, Minnesota police Officer Jeromino Yanez killed Philando Castile during a traffic stop. Castile was a licensed gun owner who had told Yanez he had his permitted weapon with him in the car; he was shot while trying to comply with the officer's orders. The grim aftermath of the shooting was broadcast live on social media by his girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, who was in the car with him along with her 4-year-old daughter. Yanez was charged with manslaughter, but was acquitted in June 2017.Although questions have been raised in news reports about Noor's and Yanez's training in relations to the deaths of the two Minnesota residents, there is no evidence to suggest that ""Big Pharma"" somehow influenced the two officers who responded to Damond's 911 call to target her for assassination in an ongoing conspiracy to kill off holistic healers."
419,419,174.NoEvidenceLisaLoring,"On Jan. 28, 2023, former child actor Lisa Loring died at the age of 64, reportedly after having ""suffered a massive stroke brought on by smoking and high blood pressure.""Loring was perhaps best known in her role as Wednesday Addams on ""The Addams Family,"" which aired on TV from 1964 through 1966. She also appeared on episodes of the soap opera, ""As the World Turns.""On Jan. 29, Variety.com reported that her daughter, Vanessa Foumberg, confirmed the news that had previously been posted on Facebook by a friend. The friend wrote:It is with great sadness that I report the death of our friend, Lisa Loring. 4 Days ago she suffered a massive stroke brought on by smoking and high blood pressure. She had been on life support for 3 days. Yesterday, her family made the difficult decision to remove it and she passed last night. She is embedded in the tapestry that is pop culture and in our hearts always as Wednesday Addams.Beautiful, kind, a loving mother, Lisa's legacy in the world of entertainment is huge. And the legacy for her family and friends -- a wealth of humor, affection and love will long play in our memories. RIP, Lisa. Damn, girl...you were a ton of fun.:Despite this information being reported about Loring's cause of death, on Jan. 30, the Twitter account @DiedSuddenly_ tweeted erroneously about the news anyway, implying a COVID-19 vaccine caused her death. The account's owner, who apparently pays $8 per month for the Twitter Blue service in order to display a blue checkmark, mentioned Loring's passing with the hashtag ""#diedsuddenly,"" despite there being no evidence that her cause of death had anything to do with COVID-19 vaccines or booster shots.The account's name references the widely debunked ""died suddenly"" conspiracy theory, which we've reported about before. In recent months, the usage of the two words ""died suddenly"" had become a way to push a rumor that posits, without credible evidence, that COVID-19 vaccines have increased incidences of people suddenly dying with little to no warning.:Other tweets also made baseless reference to COVID-19 vaccines causing Loring's death.We previously shut down a rumor posted by the same @DiedSuddenly_ account that misled users about the story of COVID survivor Claire Bridges.Despite being shown to be misleading, the account did not appear to ever issue any sort of correction as a way of showing accountability.:Earlier in January, a rumor was promoted that Lynette ""Diamond"" Hardaway of the right-wing Diamond and Silk duo had ""died suddenly."" The apparent implication was that the COVID-19 vaccine was to blame. In fact, the rumor even appeared to be pushed at Hardaway's funeral by her former colleague, Rochelle ""Silk"" Richardson.However, The Associated Press did some digging and found that Hardaway's death certificate said she died of ""heart disease due to chronic high blood pressure.""The apparent strategy for some users who push the ""died suddenly"" conspiracy theory (other than to pay to receive a blue checkmark) is to publish news about young people, athletes, and celebrities as soon as they pass away, with the implication that the COVID-19 vaccine was at least partially to blame. Sometimes, this is done before more is known about the cause of death.By the time the person's cause of death is reported days or weeks later, with official records being revealed that do not make any mention of COVID-19 vaccines as being part of the cause of death, the users who initially pushed the misleading news choose to not issue any corrections. Their strategy has apparently been to ignore the authoritative information coming from records and medical professionals. Instead, they look to find fresh stories of more recently deceased people, so they can continue to push the same kinds of rumors in an endless, baseless fashion.:This story will be updated if more details come to light regarding Loring's cause of death."

Bush at Guantanamo Bay.Rating:Originated as SatireAbout this rating In January 2022, websites and social media accounts aligned with the QAnon cluster of conspiracy theories enthusiastically shared a false and distasteful post that claimed U.S. military officials had overseen the execution, at Guantanamo Bay, of former President George W. Bush. :For example, on Jan. 6, TrustTheQ.com published an article with the headline ""George W. Bush Hanged at GITMO,"" which claimed that the 43rd president had been summarily convicted of ""murder and treason"" and, having been detained at Guantanamo, was executed by hanging there ""on Tuesday morning"" [Jan. 4].The same piece was republished on BestNewsHere.com, and formed the basis of videos by various conspiracy theorists who evidently interpreted it as an earnest account.In reality, though, the ""Bush execution"" story was not only utterly false, but originated on Real Raw News -- a website that routinely publishes sensationalist conspiracy theories and QAnon-adjacent clickbait, while using the disclaimer that the site contains ""humor, parody and satire""::Snopes regularly debunks some of the gory fantasies published by Real Raw News about the fictional arrest and execution of various political figures, including Hillary Clinton, Bill Gates, Chelsea Clinton and, of course, Bush -- who was the subject of a fake ""arrest"" story by Real Raw News just weeks earlier. As such, the stories' trademark style -- laughable dialogue, action-movie one-liners, and a seemingly infinite pool of anonymous ""sources"" inside the most elite and secretive U.S. military circles -- will have become familiar to some readers, by now. However, most readers perusing the story on TrustTheQ.com, for example, or watching ""gh05tR0b 5's"" YouTube commentary on it, would not have been aware of its true origins, and would not have been directed to the ""humor, parody and satire"" disclaimer on RealRawNews.com.This is one of the reasons why Snopes sometimes writes about satire -- because even content that was originally published with a ""satire"" disclaimer is routinely stripped from that context and republished elsewhere, without any such warnings. : "

Marjorie Taylor Greene made another controversial statement in June 2021, this time saying that she does not believe in evolution.:Greene made the remarks during an interview on Steve Bannon's podcast in which they discussed COVID-19 origin theories. Bannon asked her if she believed in gain of function research, in which scientists deliberately enhance pathogens in a lab to study them and prepare for future pandemics. She responded:No, I don't buy it because I don't believe in evolution. I don't believe in that type of so-called ""science"" [uses air quotes]. I don't believe in evolution, I believe in God and these viruses were not making people sick until they created them and [...] weaponize these viruses to be able to attach to our cells and make us sick. This has caused so many people to die all over the world. This is a bio-weapon. Greene was again furthering an unproven conspiracy theory about the origin of the novel coronavirus that claims COVID-19 came from a lab and was intentionally spread to the public.

422,422,62.WalmartClosureConspi,"Claim:Various military- and legal-related conspiracy theories explain why several Walmart stores suddenly closed in April 2015.Rating:FalseAbout this rating WalMart looms large in the American landscape -- not just as the operator of a ubiquitous chain of retail discount stores that encompasses over 4,500 outlets across the U.S., or as the economic behemoth that is both the world's largest company (by revenue) and the world's biggest private employer. No, WalMart also looms large as a shadowy behind-the-scenes force, a willing collaborator in furthering furtive government plots through actions such as transporting signs announcing the upcoming imposition of martial law on WalMart trucks, allowing federal immigration officials free rein to enter WalMart stores and arrest anyone suspected of being an illegal immigrant, and secretly funding the legal defense costs of a white police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black teenager.:It's no wonder, then, that rumors began to swirl in April 2015 when several WalMart stores around the U.S. were abruptly closed due what WalMart claimed were ""plumbing problems"": WalMarts in Pico Rivera, California, Livingston, Texas, Midland, Texas, Brandon, Florida, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, all suddenly closed their doors, with WalMart corporate announcing that some of those outlets would be shuttered for six months or more.Several aspects of these closures struck WalMart employees and shoppers as implausible. How was it that several stores in widely dispersed areas of the U.S. with nothing in common all needed to be shut down simultaneously in order to address ""plumbing problems""? Why were all these stores closed with barely more than a few hours' notice to WalMart customers and workers? Why should rectifying plumbing issues require that these stores be closed for upwards of six months? Why the seeming lack of required city work permits and marked septic or plumbing trucks at the affected locations? In the absence of more satisfying explanations, skeptical onlookers developed numerous conspiracy theories about the ""real"" reasons behind the closures:: The closures were a form of ""union-busting"" activity intended to get rid workers who were publicly critical of WalMart's labor practices, such as employees of the Pico Rivera store. However, this theory doesn't account for why several other WalMart stores not particularly known as hotbeds of labor activism were also shuttered. The closures were linked to the U.S. Army's Jade Helm military exercise scheduled for the summer of 2015 (which involved soldiers trying to operate undetected amongst civilian populations in areas where residents will be advised to report any suspicious activity), the imposition of martial law, and the construction of so-called ""FEMA Domes"" across Texas. (This theory didn't account for why WalMart stores in states far outside the geographic range of the Jade Helm exercises, such as Florida and Oklahoma, should also have been closed. The affected stores received radioactive food shipments from the Fukushima region of Japan (the site of the a nuclear power plant that melted down after a massive 8.9 earthquake hit that country in March 2011) and are closed for necessary decontamination efforts. (This theory didn't account for why only five geographically dispersed WalMarts out of the thousands of U.S. stores would have been so affected.  Were these five WalMart stores unique in importing food products from Japan?): WalMart violated local and federal building codes in erecting their stores and needed a cover story to explain closures required to furtively remove dangerous construction materials such as asbestos. (But why would only five WalMarts out of thousands have been built with code-violating materials? And why risk calling attention to the issue by shutting them all down simultaneously?) WalMart closed the stores in order to avoid having to pay out damages for some unspecified form of lawsuit. (This didn't make much legal sense, as closing particular stores wouldn't protect the WalMart corporation from lawsuits involving them, businesses typically carry liability insurance to cover such contingencies, and the financial losses the chain would suffer from closing down multiple stores for several months each would likely be costlier than anything but a very large lawsuit.) The closed WalMart stores were being converted into giant entrance facilities for a network of underground tunnels that the U.S. military would use to link ""deep underground military bases"" (DUMBS) and secretly transport troops across the U.S. (But why risk public exposure by building all those entrances in existing WalMart stores when the federal government owned plenty of land all over the country? And unless the military only intended to move troops to and from a handful of states, they'd need other entrances and exits, so where were are those other entrances going to be located, and how would the military have covered their construction? For that matter, how was this massive underground tunnel complex across the U.S. going to be built in the first place?): The closed WalMart stores were to be used as ""food distribution centers"" and housing for ""invading troops from China, here to disarm Americans."" (Didn't seem likely Chinese ground troops could disarm the entirety of America while being housed and fed in just four states out of fifty.) Something involving lots and lots of helicopters that allegedly ""flew to one of the mysteriously closed Walmart stores in Texas."" (This according to one anonymous source in Spring, Texas, who apparently couldn't identify whether that store was the one in Livingston or Midland, even though those cities are over 400 miles apart).As unsatisfying as it may be, the most plausible theory from this bunch was that the closed WalMart stores all had really bad plumbing problems."
423,423,464.FacebookSoftBansAlex,"Facebook announced on 27 July 2018 that they had temporarily suspended conspiracy troll Alex Jones for violating their platform's rules, meaning he won't be able to post content to his InfoWars-related Facebook pages for 30 days. However, other InfoWars administrators can and are continuing to post content.The move came as the social media giant both touted their efforts to crack down on misinformation with the 2018 midterm elections looming and struggled to justify allowing Jones, a long-time purveyor of misinformation and conspiracy theories, to maintain pages on Facebook. A company spokesperson said four videos attacking religious affiliation and gender identity posted by InfoWars had been removed from Facebook, while a fourth had been taken down for bullying:Our Community Standards make it clear that we prohibit content that encourages physical harm [bullying], or attacks on someone based on their religious affiliation or gender identity [hate speech]. We remove content that violates our standards as soon as we're aware of it. In this case, we received reports related to four different videos on the Pages that Infowars and Alex Jones maintain on Facebook. We reviewed the content against our Community Standards and determined that it violates. All four videos have been removed from Facebook:Facebook appeared to follow YouTube's lead, which two days earlier had banned the same four videos for hate speech against Muslims and transgender people, and depictions of child endangerment. Those videos are all still live on the InfoWars web site, however.One of the videos shows a man shove a boy of about seven years old onto his face on a paved surface. As the child wails, a voice-over intones, ""Prevent liberalism and use condoms. Help save America. This has been a public service announcement from InfoWars.com."" In another video, Jones says Eastern Europe isn't taking in any migrants from North Africa or the Middle East ""because they know they're not compatible, they don't work, they commit massive crime, they are extremely caveman-like and war-like and treat women like dogs. They also attack people that own dogs. You don't have dogs under Islam."" In yet another clip he likens drag culture with child abuse.The question about Jones and his large Facebook following garnered widespread attention when CNN reporter Oliver Darcy asked about it during a 11 July 2018 event meant to tout the platform's commitment to fighting fake news. Darcy questioned how allowing Jones and InfoWars to remain on Facebook was consistent with the company's stated mission, to which Facebook executives replied that ""just ... being false doesn't violate [Facebook's] community standards."":The platform's decision to ban videos for hate speech violations raised questions about InfoWars' habit of presenting predominantly non-white, Muslim migrants to Europe as a threat. We asked Facebook why a series of other posts published over a two-day period that cast migrants as threats didn't similarly run afoul of the hate speech standard::A Facebook spokesperson told us the posts, when taken on a case-by-case basis, did not violate the company's community standards on hate speech because they individually either didn't use dehumanizing language or directly attack migrants. They also did not overtly call for violence and thus could not be interpreted as threats.Mark Pitcavage, senior research fellow for the Center on Extremism at the Anti-Defamation League, told us that although an anti-immigrant or anti-Muslim message is implied in many InfoWars posts, Facebook's moderators would be hard-pressed to interpret each post individually as constituting hate speech because of the level of nuance involved:Dealing with Jones on a post-by-post basis doesn't do much because these posts taken individually don't cross a clear line.A number of these posts contain troubling language [yet] don't contain overt hate speech. But taken together, someone reading a bunch of these can certainly learn or imbibe intolerance or possibly even hatred toward immigrants or Muslims from the sum total of content.You would have to look at the totality of the content and ask, when all of this is judged together, is this a site that is contributing to anything in any positive way, or is it a site that can only cause harm to society and provide a negative user experience for people on the platform? To what extent is he using or exploiting the platform in question to present ideas that are problematic, dangerous, and may incite violence or intolerance?:Jones and his ilk often use made-up nightmare scenarios about Muslim ""no-go zones"" and rampant migrant crime in Europe to tap into anti-immigrant sentiment in the U.S., where audiences may not have easy access to information that would debunk stories about events occurring thousands of miles away and reported in different languages.Pitcavage recalled how in 2015 Jones was able to motivate his followers to take political action over a conspiracy theory he pushed claiming that Jade Helm, a military training exercise was in fact an effort by the Obama administration to invade Texas: ""Jones does have the ability to motivate people to actually take action when he gets sufficiently agitated about something. The themes he chooses to promote, it becomes important. If he increasingly has anti-Muslim or anti-immigrant content, that is inevitably going to have an effect on his audience.""On 25 July 2018, Leonard Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa, parents of Noah Pozner, a 6-year-old murdered in the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school massacre, published an open letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg blasting the social media giant for ""protecting"" hoax theories claiming that the victims of the school shooting were ""crisis actors"" and that the shooting never took place. Jones is currently being sued by Pozner and De La Rosa, who claim he defamed them by heavily promoting those stories on InfoWars.:Amid these controversies, Facebook was also criticized for allowing a 23 July 2018 video to remain on their platform in which Jones ranted, ""It's not a joke. It's not a game. It's the real world. Politically. You're going to get it, or I'm going to die trying, bitch,"" about U.S. Department of Justice special council Robert Mueller, who is currently investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election."
424,424,51.DoestheBarinBarExamD,"Claim:In the United States, the lawyers' ""bar"" stands for ""British Accredited Registry"" and is part of a property-grabbing conspiracy.Rating:FalseAbout this rating One of the more unusual and complicated theories associated with the sovereign citizen and tax protester movements is the belief that lawyers who are members of bar associations in the United States are, in fact, agents of the British crown and do not have legitimate status in American courts. This theory is partly informed by a false but widely repeated claim that the word ""bar"" in this context is an acronym for ""British Accreditation Register"":::Here's how the elaborate and confusing theory is outlined in an anonymously-authored essay called ""Hiding Behind the Bar,"" which has been republished and shared in tax protester and sovereign citizen circles for more than a decade:During the middle 1600's, the Crown of England established a formal registry in London where barristers [lawyers] were ordered by the Crown to be accredited. The establishment of this first International Bar Association allowed barrister-lawyers from all nations to be formally recognized and accredited by the only recognized accreditation society.From this, the acronym BAR was established denoting (informally) the British Accredited Registry, whose members became a powerful and integral force within the International Bar Association (IBA). Although this has been denied repeatedly as to its existence, the acronym BAR stood for the British barrister-lawyers who were members of the larger IBA.Almost every part of this is factually inaccurate. For one thing, the International Bar Association was founded in 1947, not in the 1600s. Second, we could find no evidence of the existence of a professional association for lawyers called the ""British Accredited Registry,"" either in 2018 or at any previous time in history.:A History of the American Bar, a 1911 book by the Pulitzer Prize-winning legal scholar Charles Warren, contains no mention of any ""British Accredited Registry"" or ""British Accreditation Registry"" (with ""accredited"" and ""accreditation"" being used variously in different versions of this conspiracy theory). It would also make little sense for a group of lawyers in 17th century England to form a group describing itself as ""British."" Great Britain (composed of England, Wales and Scotland) does not have, and has never had, a unified courts system, instead being separated into two systems: England and Wales and Scotland. In fact, Great Britain itself was not even formally created until 1707, when the Acts of Union joined the Kingdom of Scotland with the Kingdom of England (which included Wales).But more broadly, this theory offers a confused summary of the history of ""the bar.""In the Middle Ages, lawyers in London established four ""Inns of Court"": Lincoln's Inn, the Inner Temple, the Middle Temple, and Gray's Inn. These were physical buildings but, more figuratively, they were also the professional associations for lawyers working in the more important English courts.  A ""barrister"" was a legal expert or advocate who has been ""called to the bar."" This is a metonymic phrase which is rooted in the physical barrier that was present in a courtroom, to separate fully qualified lawyers entitled to plead cases before a judge from (roughly speaking) trainee lawyers and members of the public. In modern times, this physical barrier generally separates participants in a trial (such as lawyers, clerks, defendants, the jury, and the judge) from the gallery in which members of the public and the news media sit.:So someone who has been ""called to the bar"" has been given the right to advocate before a judge and is thereby known as a ""barrister."" A ""bar association"" is, roughly speaking, a professional association for lawyers, akin to a guild.  In some jurisdictions, bar associations are limited to barristers (as opposed to solicitors, a different type of lawyer); whereas in others, they are open to all members of the legal profession. In some jurisdictions a bar association is the body that licenses and regulates legal professionals, and in others it is merely a professional association.The ""BAR"" conspiracy theory essay goes on to say:When America was still a chartered group of British colonies under patent -- established in what was formally named the British Crown territory of New England -- the first British Accredited Registry (BAR) was established in Boston during 1761 to attempt to allow only accredited barrister-lawyers access to the British courts of New England. This was the first attempt to control who could represent defendants in the court at or within the bar in America.Today, each corporate STATE in America has it's [sic] own BAR Association, i.e. The Florida Bar or the California Bar, that licenses government officer attorneys, NOT lawyers. In reality, the U.S. courts only allow their officer attorneys to freely enter within the bar while prohibiting those learned of the law -- lawyers -- to do so.They prevent advocates, lawyers, counselors, barristers and solicitors from entering through the outer bar. Only licensed BAR Attorneys are permitted to freely enter within the bar separating the people from the bench because all BAR Attorneys are officers of the court itself. Does that tell you anything?:A 1930 essay published in the Cornell Law Review (page 393) refers to a bar association's having been established in Boston in 1761, but remember that a bar association is no more than a kind of guild for lawyers. ""Bar"" is not an acronym for ""British Accredited Registry,"" because that acronym is a fabrication. As with many sovereign citizen theories, the essay builds on the shaky foundations of an inaccurate account of the history of bar associations in the United States and draws confused conclusions about the function and legal status of lawyers.Many of these claims are based on the etymology of certain words, rather than their modern meaning. For example, the author of the essay referenced above presents the origins of the word ""attorney,"" citing Webster's 1828 dictionary definition, as: ""In the feudal law, to turn, or transfer homage and service from one lord to another."" That essay also proclaims:Here's where the whole word game gets really tricky. In each State, every licensed BAR Attorney calls himself an Attorney at Law. Look at the definitions above and see for yourself that an Attorney at Law is nothing more than an attorney -- one who transfers allegiance and property to the ruling land owner.:That passage is false. Whatever the older origins of the word ""attorney"" might be, the modern definition of that word is much broader. Merriam-Webster defines an attorney as simply ""one who is legally appointed to transact business on another's behalf."" In common American parlance, ""attorney"" is used interchangeably with ""lawyer.""This fixation on word origins leads to something like a game of Telephone in the logic of the conspiracy theory, with false conclusions being drawn from inaccurate or incomplete premises. Here are more examples, summarized from the essay:Attorneys often give themselves the title ""esquire""In feudal England, an esquire or ""squire"" was a kind of property manager for a wealthy land-ownerEsquires used to be responsible for ""attornment,"" which in feudal England involved transferring land and property between lordsTherefore, lawyers who describe themselves as attorneys or have the title ""esquire"" are ""sworn oath officers of the State whose sole authority is to transfer your property to their landowner-employer."":The historical origins of the word ""esquire"" did have to do with the transfer of property between feudal land-owners, but that was hundreds of years ago. This argument is roughly analogous to claiming that because the title ""Ph.D"" derives from the Latin ""philosophiae doctor"" (""doctor of philosophy""), microbiologists with Ph.D at the end of their names have no legal right to conduct scientific research because they are actually philosophers and not scientists.""A BAR [British Accredited Registry] licensed Attorney is not an advocate,"" the theory goes on to falsely claim, ""so how can he do anything other than what his real purpose is?"":He can't plead on your behalf because that would be a conflict of interest. He can't represent the crown (ruling government) as an official officer at the same time he is allegedly representing a defendant.His sworn duty as a BAR Attorney is to transfer your ownership, rights, titles, and allegiance to the land owner. When you hire a BAR Attorney to represent you in their courts, you have hired an officer of that court whose sole purpose and occupation is to transfer what you have to the creator and authority of that court. :It's not clear what the origins of the the fabricated acronym are, but ""British Accredited Registry"" was invoked as early as 2001 by Austin Gary Cooper, a long-time ""sovereign citizen"" activist. In 2003, a U.S. District Court in Colorado barred Cooper and his wife Martha Cooper from selling advice on how to avoid paying federal income tax after the couple set up groups called ""Taking Back America"" and the ""Ten Foundation,"" which advised their paying customers that they could renounce their United States citizenship, call themselves ""American citizens"" instead, and escape their tax obligations. In 2006, Cooper was given a six-month prison sentence for criminal contempt after failing to comply with that court order, which obliged him to hand over the names of his customers, among other requirements. During court proceedings, Cooper accused the judge of treason and called him a ""Nazi bastard"" and a ""British Accredited Registry"" lawyer, saying: ""You people are going to destroy our country. British accredited registry bar association, you're going to destroy our country ...""In 2017, prosecutors in Tennessee charged Cooper, who is now 69 years old, with 10 counts of forgery and filing a fraudulent lien. The case was ongoing as of January 2018.:"
425,425,541.MarjorieTaylorGreene,"This article is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.When Georgia representative and sometime QAnon enthusiast Marjorie Taylor Greene met with fellow House Republicans on Feb. 3, she may have apologized. Or she may not have.During the closed-door meeting in which Greene's conspiracy theory beliefs came up, we don't know exactly what went down because, well, it was behind closed doors. Speaking after the event, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy described Greene's remarks as an apology, saying that Greene had denounced her previous statements and social media postings - which included the idea that mass school shootings are ""false flag"" operations and that California forest fires were started by Jewish space lasers - and that ""she said she was wrong."" :U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, one of 10 Republicans who voted in support of the 2021 impeachment of Donald Trump, had a different take: ""She was somewhat contrite, but personally I never heard an apology."" He added: ""I didn't hear an 'I'm going to say this publicly.'""As a scholar who has written about the art of the public political apology, I found the whole episode fits into a larger pattern of nonapology apologies in the modern political landscape. Sorry seems to be the hardest wordAn apology, according to the Canadian sociologist Erving Goffman, is ""a splitting of the self into a blameworthy part and a part that stands back and sympathizes with the blame giving."" Goffman goes on to say that after an offense has occurred, the job of the person apologizing is to show an understanding of the norm violated and the harm done.:What this means in practice is that offenders must identify what they did wrong and then demonstrate that they take responsibility for that wrong, that they accept the blame. To be a true apology this has to be accompanied with some sincerity and with a sense of how the offender will act differently in the future.If a public apology includes these four elements - naming the harm, taking responsibility, sincerely accepting blame and committing to act differently - then it can help repair a relationship or even save a reputation.Even if we are to take McCarthy's word that an apology occurred in Greene's case, we are none the wiser as to which parts of her embrace of QAnon and other conspiracies she had said sorry for.The day after the Republican conference meeting, Greene took to the floor of the House of Representatives and characterized her past posts in this way: ""These were words of the past and these things do not represent me, they do not represent my district and they do not represent my values."":She went on say that she had ""stumbled across"" QAnon and ""was allowed to believe things that weren't true, and I would ask questions about them and talk about them. And that is absolutely what I regret.""So, is this to be taken as an apology? Whether Marjorie Taylor Greene has met the criteria established by Goffman is, at best, open to interpretation.But she isn't alone - good public apologies seem rare today.'Mistakes were made'Part of the difficulty has to do with the loss of standards held in common by a community. For a scholar like Goffman, it was taken for granted that an apology reflected common norms of behavior.:Gone are the days when Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy could agree, as they did in their second debate in 1960, that the United States should apologize when it is wrong, as when a long-planned Paris summit in 1960 collapsed after it was revealed the U.S. had covered up spy-plane flights over the Soviet Union. They naturally disagreed about whether the U.S. was in the wrong, but they agreed that apology was sometimes necessary. Nixon went on to become an expert in the art of the nonapology, as seen in his response to the Watergate scandal. His ""mistakes were made"" approach, which uses a passive voice to avoid laying the blame directly on oneself, was later adopted by others, including Ronald Reagan over the Iran-Contra affair.Today's culture is too fractured for most public figures to risk a full-fledged apology. In the U.S., gerrymandered districts, continual fundraising appeals to a base, hyperpartisan media and a polarized electorate have conspired to deliver an environment in which apologizing is fraught with concerns. If one apologizes, it signals a backtracking to the base one is courting. If one refuses to apologize, that rallies supporters and donors.:In such circumstances, it is hard to admit you are wrong much less that you have behaved badly. In such an environment, it is perhaps understandable why Greene's apology was behind closed doors and not delivered in public.'Never make excuses' might have been a more accurate line for John Wayne's Capt. Brittles.Silver Screen Collection/Moviepix via Getty ImagesThe death of the public apology has been long in the making. It fits an approach best exemplified by Nathan Brittles, a character played by actor John Wayne in the John Ford Western ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon."" The 1949 film popularized the expression ""Never apologize - it's a sign of weakness,"" which has become the slogan of a type of public toughness over the past half-century. Ironically, that slogan is misunderstood; Nathan Brittles takes responsibility for the failure of his mission in the movie. The line should be ""Never make excuses - it's a sign of weakness.""This (mis)understanding of the apology as a sign of weakness has certainly been the mantra of Donald Trump for many years. The former president's style was to attack and insult, playing effectively to a base, and never say sorry.:Four-star apologyIn the absence of public apologies from elected political leaders, perhaps it is better to look to the military, like the fictional Capt. Brittles, for outward signs of contrition.While Trump avoided taking responsibility over failings in the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the four-star general heading the government's Operation Warp Speed vaccine program, Gustave Perna, was more accountable.Speaking in late December, Perna took responsibility for how errors in the projections of COVID-19 vaccines to be distributed resulted in states getting fewer doses than they had been promised. ""I want to take personal responsibility for the miscommunication. I know that's not done much these days. But I am responsible. And I take responsibility for the miscommunication,"" he said, adding, ""I failed. I am adjusting. I am fixing. And we will move forward from there."":That apology names the harm, takes responsibility, accepts blames and commits to doing better. And it was delivered in public, in stark contrast to Greene's expressions of regret.Edwin Battistella, Professor of Linguistics, Southern Oregon UniversityThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

The YouTube page that originally up this video is populated with grainy, vague videos that are supposedly space phenomena, like a gun on Mars, or buildings on the moon's surface.:The post, though dubious in its origin, was picked up by conspiracy theory blogs like Disclose.tv:Commenting on this latest video UFO blogger, Scott C. Waring noted on his UFO Sightings Daily blog that the alien ship has a huge main body with four individual prongs which look like arms.""This UFO was spotted by UFO researcher Streetcap1 of YouTube, "" Waring wrote. ""The video shows a long-armed UFO in the distance.""According to the prolific alien hunter, the video also shows that our own sunlight reflects from the body and arms of the UFO, causing it to glisten which proves the authenticity of the video. The reflective properties of the mysterious object confirm its existence, and the object was seen for only a few seconds before NASA's infamous blue screen appeared.""I feel that the public is trusting NASA less and less when it comes to revealing life on other planets, "" Waring said. ""Their true goal seems to be to gather important intelligence, and drip feeds the public enough to satisfy their curiosity.""Other UFO and alien enthusiasts noticed that there was a similarity between this ""four armed UFO"" and a UFO that has in the past been sighted, multiple times, flying past the sun on NASA SOHO images.:(SOHO is short for the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory spacecraft, tasked by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration with studying the sun.)While the video shows almost nothing except a blurred image followed by a blue screen -- all of which could have easily been created with a toy and rudimentary video-making skills -- dubious blogs and conspiracy-minded people have circulated the story along with the claim that this object has been seen before, but NASA is trying hide it:SOHO cameras captured similar flybys in 2011, 2012, and 2016... Our Sun appears to be a popular stopover for interstellar crafts, including cruiseships, battleships, and expeditionary fleets, passing through our solar neighborhood.If the object has appeared before, and if there are alien spacecraft using the sun as an interstellar freeway overpass, it seems unlikely that anyone would be able to cover it up. It also defies reason that NASA's own equipment is picking up images of extraterrestrial spacecraft and distributing those images on a platform that the public is easily able to access -- but that the agency is denying it.:The video can be seen here:"
427,427,636.WastheDeathofFBIAgen,"Claim:FBI agent Sal Cincinelli's death is linked to the Clinton Foundation.Rating:FalseAbout this rating If you are experiencing distress, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or visit online here.One of the most enduring conspiracy theories around is known as the ""Clinton body bags."" That theory posits that any death that can be linked to former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton should be linked, even if no real-world evidence exists to do so. Basically the theory suggests that people who had incriminating evidence against the Clintons have all died under suspicious circumstances, with the assumption the Clintons were responsible for the deaths.:No evidence exists that the Clintons, who have have been in the public spotlight for decades and investigated multiple times, are guilty of ""bumping off"" anyone. But as with many conspiracy theories, the lack of evidence hasn't stopped the spread of misinformation.The most recent iteration of this theory focused on the death of Salvatore (""Sal"") Cincinelli, an FBI agent who died in Austin, Texas, in July 2019. Junk news sites like True Pundit picked up on the story, reporting without evidence that Cincinelli ""investigated the Clinton Foundation"" and thus his passing must be linked to the Clintons. The Foundation is a charitable non-profit founded by the two Democrats and is the frequent fixation of the Clintons' political opponents and conspiracy theorists.We know of no link between Cincinelli and the Clintons or their foundation, though he is linked to a different high-profile case. Cincinelli was the brother of Valerie Cincinelli, a former New York City police officer who has been accused of attempting to hire a contract killer to murder her ex-husband and her boyfriend's teenage daughter.:Austin police are investigating Cincinelli's death as self-inflicted. Police were called to a ""deceased person"" at the address of the Container Bar on Rainey Street in downtown Austin just before midnight on July 16. The FBI has declined to comment on the case, including possible motive. But a 2012 Reuters story featuring Cincinelli characterized him as having left a high-paying career on Wall Street two years prior to join the FBI as a financial-crimes specialist.Some readers on social media thought it suspicious that local news outlets didn't report the death, but that is no surprise. Except under special circumstances, such as when an incident involves a public figure, legitimate news sources generally avoid reporting on suicides because of a well-documented risk of copycat fatalities. Mental health organizations also urge that when reporting is necessary, outlets should avoid sensationalizing or providing information that could encourage others to follow suit.The suicide story became public when the New York Post first reported it about a week after it occurred, noting that the FBI agent was related to Valerie Cincinelli, an ongoing news item in New York.:In sum, no evidence exists that Cincinelli's death is linked to the Clintons or the Clinton Foundation, and the connection appears to be a fabrication by junk news sites and those parroting it on social media without evidence. At this time, the only information available is that Austin police are investigating the death as a suicide."

As of Jan. 10, her cause of death had not yet been released, according to The Associated Press (AP). The other half of the duo, Rochelle ""Silk"" Richardson, is her sister.:The AP noted that a November 2022 tweet asked for prayers for Hardaway, but not did specify any further details.Diamond and Silk rose to fame in right-wing circles around the 2016 U.S. presidential election, where they showed ardent support of former U.S. President Donald Trump.:It was Trump who announced Hardaway's death on Truth Social on Jan. 9:Really bad news for Republicans and frankly, ALL Americans. Our beautiful Diamond, of Diamond and Silk, has just passed away at her home in the State she loved so much, North Carolina. Silk was with her all the way, and at her passing. There was no better TEAM anywhere, or at any time! Diamond's death was totally unexpected, probably her big and precious HEART just plain gave out. Rest In Peace our Magnificent Diamond, you will be greatly missed!As for the claim about whether Diamond and Silk were fired from Fox News for COVID-19 conspiracy theories, we found credible reporting that supported this rumor.On April 27, 2020, near the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, The Daily Beast reported, ""Fox News Cuts Ties With Diamond & Silk, Unofficial Trump 'Advisers' Who Spread Bonkers Coronavirus Claims"":Fox News has cut ties with MAGA vlogging superstars Diamond & Silk, who had contributed original content to the network's streaming service Fox Nation since shortly after its late 2018 launch.The sudden split comes after the Trump-boosting siblings have come under fire for promoting conspiracy theories and disinformation about the coronavirus. ""After what they've said and tweeted you won't be seeing them on Fox Nation or Fox News anytime soon,"" a source with knowledge of the matter told The Daily Beast.After rising to prominence during the 2016 election, Lynette ""Diamond"" Hardaway and Rochelle ""Silk"" Richardson leveraged their newfound celebrity into regular sycophantic appearances on Fox News, resulting in President Donald Trump raving about their performances, featuring them at rallies, and treating them as ""senior advisers."":The Daily Beast added that Fox Business TV host Trish Regan ""was also ditched by Fox after her own comments calling the pandemic an 'impeachment scam.'""The more recent reporting from the AP following Hardaway's death provided further details of the firing from Fox News:The network removed them from its list of contributors in 2020 after they came under fire for spreading false information about the pandemic and vaccines.

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. :In November 2020, as news broke that a vaccination for COVID-19 was being prepared for distribution, a rumor started circulating on social media that the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline owned a laboratory in Wuhan, China -- the Wuhan Institute of Virology -- where conspiracy theorists falsely maintain the COVID-19 pandemic originated. This rumor, which reads like a game of six-degrees of separation, attempts to trace a line from GlaxoSmithKline, to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, to the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, to billionaire philanthropist and frequent right-wing boogeyman George Soros, and, in some iterations of this rumor, to Microsoft CEO Bill Gates.Here's one version of the rumor that was posted to Twitter::This tweet reads: ""The Chinese biological laboratory in Wuhan is owned by Glaxo! Who, by cnance [sic], owns Pfizer! (the one who produces the vaccine!) Which, by chance, is managed by Black Rock finances. Who, by chance, manages the finances of the Open Foundation Company (SOROS FOUNDATION)!""This nonsensical game of connect the dots starts with a false assertion. The pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline does not own the Wuhan Institute of Virology.The Wuhan Institute of Virology -- a research lab in China that has been the center of conspiracy theories since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic -- is operated by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), and is funded, in large part, by the Chinese government. It is not owned by GlaxoSmithKline or any other private company.""Over the past 40 years, half of its income has come directly from central-government investment; the rest has been from competitive funding or technology transfer. CAS could not develop without the funding and support of the central government."":It's also false to say that GlaxoSmithKline owns the pharmaceutical company Pfizer. While these two companies share some common interests -- in 2018, they announced a joint venture that combined their consumer health businesses -- they remain two distinct companies. The Wall Street Journal reported at the time:Pfizer Inc. and GlaxoSmithKline PLC plan to combine their consumer health-care units and eventually spin off the joint venture, creating the world's largest seller of drugstore staples like Advil and Sensodyne toothpaste.The deal, announced Wednesday, will free up both companies to concentrate on prescription medicines, which tend to be more profitable if also higher risk.The joint venture represents an unexpected conclusion to a yearlong process by Pfizer to shed its consumer business, as it and other pharmaceutical companies focus on higher-margin prescription drugs. While Glaxo has shared that focus, the British drugmaker had remained committed to its consumer business, which its chief executive led before her promotion to the top job last year.:This joint venture, however, did not involve one company buying the other. This rumor appears to have been created with the intent of stirring up confusion and skepticism over the COVID-19 vaccine by connecting pharmaceutical companies to a laboratory in Wuhan, China. GlaxoSmithKline, however, does not own the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Furthermore, claims that COVID-19 was ""manufactured,"" or that it ""escaped from"" this Chinese lab, are nothing more than baseless conspiracy theories. "
430,430,124.ConspiracyTheoristsT,"Claim:Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was trafficking children via the Ever Given cargo ship that got stuck in the Suez Canal in March 2021. Rating:FalseAbout this rating In March 2021, a massive cargo ship called the Ever Given got stuck in the Suez Canal, blocking one of the world's busiest shipping routes. As authorities began working on a way to dislodge the stuck ship, conspiracy theorists went to work spreading unfounded rumors claiming that the ship was being used by former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a child-trafficking scheme.:The claim that Clinton is trafficking children via the stuck cargo ship is based on a pair of seemingly odd coincidences.First, the company that owns this ship is Evergreen Marine Corporation. According to journalist Ronald Kessler's book ""In the President's Secret Service: Behind the Scenes with Agents in the Line of Fire and the Presidents They Protect,"" ""Evergreen"" was the name the Secret Service once used for Clinton.Second, the call sign for this boat is ""H3RC,"" which, with a little fudging, appear to be Hillary Rodham Clinton's initials. :Why Clinton would leave behind clues to implicate herself in this alleged crime has not been explained. Furthermore, if there were any truth to these claims, one would expect a massive police presence at the Suez Canal as children are removed from these ships, as well as the announcement of an investigation into Clinton. None of that has come to pass, however, as this is nothing more than a perceived coincidence. Conspiracy theories are often built by people in search of dots to connect. In this case, some social media users noticed that this international incident bore some superficial coincidences to Clinton -- who has been the target of a variety of baseless QAnon and Pizzagate conspiracy theories concerning the occult and child trafficking since her run for president in 2016 -- and concluded that the only explanation was that Clinton was trafficking children through the Suez Canal via cargo ship. With the same barrier of evidence (taking two random factoids and forcibly drawing a line to connect them), one could argue that since this ship's International Maritime Organization (IMO) number is the same as a dentist's office in Jacksonville, Mississippi (minus the area code), this cargo ship was clearly carrying thousands of pounds of dentures. :The conclusion that this ship was trafficking children (and that Clinton was somehow involved) was reached despite the fact that no children have been seen in the containers aboard this ship, no records have been unearthed that would connect Clinton to this company, or that the Evergreen Marine Corporation has been in operation since the 1960s, long before Clinton first warranted Secret Service protection. It should also be noted that anti-trafficking organizations such as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking, and The Polaris Project, have made no statements suggesting that this cargo ship could be carrying trafficked children. In July 2020, a similarly baseless rumor was circulated that claimed the furniture store Wayfair was involved in child trafficking. This rumor was based almost entirely on the perception that some of Wayfair's cabinets seemed overpriced. Polaris, the organization that runs the U.S. National Human Trafficking Hotline, released a statement at the time saying that its phone lines had been clogged by conspiracy theorists, which had made it ""difficult for the Trafficking Hotline to provide support and attention to others who are in need of help."":"

Bourdain's girlfriend, actress Asia Argento, accused Weinstein of raping her.The tweet angered Hillary spokesman, Brian Fallon. He took to Twitter to tell Bourdain to ""eat a scorpion."" Many other Clinton winged monkeys followed suit.:""It's no secret that people who cross the Clinton's [sic] wind up dead ... mostly from suicide,"" the article continued, invoking a decades-old, long-debunked conspiracy theory linking Bill and Hillary Clinton to the supposedly ""mysterious"" deaths of some 50 former ""associates.""But apart from a displaying a series of tweets from 2017 in which Bourdain did, in fact, take Hillary Clinton to task for what he termed her ""disappointing"" initial response to the Weinstein allegations, provoking an irate response from one of her aides, the article offered no substantiation whatsoever for its central claim, namely that Bourdain's death was connected to his ""crossing"" her.In asserting that connection (attributed to unnamed ""investigators""), the web site was plying its stock-in-trade -- that is, blending fact, fiction, and hyperbole to weave conspiracy-drenched clickbait stories for social media consumption. Previously published YourNewsWire.com articles promoted such idiotic claims as Melania Trump hired an exorcist to rid the White House of demons, former child actor Macauley Culkin accused ""Satanic"" Hollywood executives of wearing shoes made from murdered children, and Pope Francis ordered ""white women"" to ""breed"" with Muslims.:French authorities have confirmed that Bourdain's death in Colmar, France, where he was filming a television show, was a suicide.

432,432,78.ConspiracyTheoriesMa,"This article about conspiracy theories is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.Conspiracy theories tend to prosper in times of crisis. When people are looking for ways to cope with uncertainty and threat, conspiracy theories may seem to offer simple answers. However, instead of making things better, conspiracy theories often make things worse.Over the course of history, conspiracy theories have been linked to conflict, prejudice, genocide and the rejection of important scientific advances. Recently, belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories (such as that the virus is a hoax) have been linked to vaccine rejection and reluctance to take action to stop the spread of the virus.However, despite their significance, we know almost nothing about how conspiracy theories affect children, or how beliefs in conspiracy theories change across the lifespan. This is because existing research on the psychology of conspiracy theories has only been conducted with adults. Scientists have not been able to study conspiracy beliefs in children because age-appropriate research methods have not been available.:We decided it was time to address this issue by developing a questionnaire suitable for young people. We have called it the adolescent conspiracy beliefs questionnaire. Using this questionnaire, we found that adolescents in the UK seem most likely to start believing in conspiracy theories around the age of 14. In one of our studies, we found that as adolescents reach around this age, their conspiracy beliefs were higher than in younger age groups. In another study, we found that 18-year-olds displayed higher belief in conspiracy theories compared to a mixed-age sample of older adults. It therefore seems that adolescence could be a peak time for conspiracy theorising.We asked participants to decide how much they agreed with nine different statements, each on a scale of 1 to 7. These included assertions such as ""secret societies influence many political decisions"", ""governments have deliberately spread diseases in certain groups of people"", and ""secret societies control politicians and other leaders"". We then calculated average scores across the nine items. A higher average score indicated a higher belief in conspiracy theories.:Between the ages of 11-14 and 14-16, belief in conspiracy theories increased from an average score of 3.72 to 4.67. Young people aged 16-17 also displayed a higher average (4.39) than the younger children. Furthermore, participants aged 18 reported higher conspiracy beliefs (4.06) than a mixed-age sample of older adults (3.81). Around the age of 14, conspiracy beliefs therefore appear to peak, and remain heightened into early adulthood, but then they appear to plateau.Why conspiracy beliefs are taking holdMany adolescents have been home schooled and isolated from their peer groups for much of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is therefore not surprising that their social media use has significantly increased during this time. This could be the ideal situation for conspiracy theories to flourish in younger groups. Indeed, a recent poll by the UK Safer Internet Centre found that 43% of young people have noticed their peers sharing misleading online content, such as fake news, over the last year, and that 48% see misleading content every day. Digital literacy is not currently a core part of the UK national curriculum, and so young people may sometimes struggle to separate fact from fiction.:https://youtu.be/7tpgp1cCWoQ   Psychological stress could also contribute to conspiracy beliefs in younger people. Our research also uncovered initial evidence that paranoia and mistrust are associated with young people's conspiracy beliefs. Other research suggests that adolescents aged 13-15 are less likely to rely on emotion regulation strategies than at other points in their life. This means that adolescents may have trouble controlling, understanding and expressing their emotions at this age, which may lead to increased anxiety and, in turn, increased belief in conspiracy theories. The additional stress and mental health worries caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may lead adolescents to turn to conspiracy theories even more to try to cope with feelings of anxiety and isolation.We know that helping adults feel more empowered can reduce their tendency to believe in conspiracy theories. That is, feeling more in control of one's social environment can reduce reliance on conspiracy theories. Also, belief in conspiracy theories is lowered when people are encouraged to think analytically. An important next step would be to examine whether such techniques help reduce conspiracy beliefs in younger people.:Our project has spotlighted young people's conspiracy beliefs for the first time. Conspiracy beliefs seem to flourish in teenage years and the COVID-19 pandemic may have made things worse.

Suarez responded angrily on his Facebook page, both to having his photographs lifted without attribution and to the fact they were appropriated by conspiracy theorists, saying in French that there were storms throughout Switzerland the night the pictures were taken (24 June 2016) and that the weather patterns had been predicted by Swiss meteorologists.:Suarez told us he and two friends were chasing the storm as it swept over Geneva, trying to capture the cloud formations and lightning. He reiterated his frustration over having his photographs published without his permission in a message to us, and also expressed dismay over the purpose they were used for:With the culture of digital photography and photos with smartphones, it is common to think that a photo has no value. I work with a photo agency located in the south of France, and I've seen the prices fall the last 15 years. The photographer is not recognized nowadays... Actually, the behavior of some media, agreeing to work with photo microstock agencies or even asking photographers to work for free, and worse, sometimes stealing the photos, is unacceptable. And in fact, that's what happened with our photos of the Geneva thunderstorm. They were stolen to demonstrate stupid theories.Suarez also told French-language magazine Le Dauphine that the pictures weren't even taken over CERN, ""but a little further on the Geneva basin."" Suarez also tweeted, ""I don't allow anyone, person or entity, (newspaper, TV, blog, etc.) to publish a picture posted on my wall, without my permission."":But Suarez' condemnations could not stop multiple web sites from taking his photographs and using them alongside the story line that CERN created an interdimensional ""portal."" One headline reads, ""What is CERN doing? Bizarre clouds over Large Hadron Collider 'prove portals are opening.'"" Yet another reads, ""Is THIS the portal to another dimension? Bizarre clouds spotted over Hadron Collider."" The stories appear mainly in tabloids and web sites with names like ""Ancient Code"" and ""Prophecy News Watch.""The narrator of the Freedom Fighter Times video says he can see a face in the cloud and angrily notes:It's amazing, because they keep messing with nature and denying it, and here is yet more proof that they are messing with nature... Now is it a coincidence that they just started their Awake experiment?""Later, after determining the picture wasn't faked, the narrator says::What portals are being opened in this cloud?... Now of course somebody's gonna call me crazy or a conspiracy theorist. That's OK, that's great. But you know what, when you actually come to the chance of where you're gonna awaken to these crazy experiments that CERN is doing, you have to realize that people have filed lawsuits against CERN.He then shows another photograph of what he says is the same area, this time with a rainbow arched over it, and goes on to warn that rainbows are a reminder that God will flood the planet if people don't repent from their sins. According to CERN's web site for the AWAKE experiment, it is the first accelerator of its kind to test plasma wakefield acceleration:A plasma wakefield is a type of wave generated by particles travelling through a plasma. AWAKE will send proton beams through plasma cells to generate these fields. By harnessing wakefields, physicists may be able to produce accelerator gradients hundreds of times higher than those achieved in current radiofrequency cavities. This would allow future colliders to achieve higher energies over shorter distances than is possible today.:CERN sits on the French-Swiss border in Switzerland and houses the world's largest particle collider -- a machine that allows scientists to test an array of theories in particle physics. Perhaps because experiments conducted at CERN carry the promise of answering large, fundamental questions about space, time and the nature of physical existence, as well as ringing in a new era of scientific accomplishments, it has been a focal point of conspiracy theorists who fear it will be a launchpad for a doomsday scenario.The video from Freedom Fighter Times (which has hundreds of thousands of views) can be seen here: :"

Her subsequent career as a mainstream, secular pop artist and sex symbol, whose lyrics and music videos are often laced with irony and humor, has made her a particular target for unfounded Satanism-related conspiracy theories.   YourNewsWire.com, of course, is well known for peddling fabricated stories and conspiracy theories such as this one."
435,435,71.ConspiracyTheoriesTa,"The Denver International Airport (DIA) has long been the focus of intrigue. Even a seemingly unremarkable video of a pile of luggage, which was being used to test new baggage claim equipment at the airport, sparked widespread fascination on social media.That's because DIA has unusual features -- which some consider otherworldly signs of malfeasance. We'll discuss those features, some of which have stirred controversy for years, below.Is the Airport Controlled by a Secret Cabal?A popular TikTok video posted on June 2, 2021, by @hyperfocuspod noted that an underlying theme of rumors and urban legends surrounding the airport is that it is controlled by a vague, unnamed group.There are a lot of specific theories, but the basic idea is that the airport is controlled by some all-powerful ""they,"" the TikTok user said in the video. ""Such as Free Masons, the New World Order, Nazis or neo-Nazis, or the Illuminati."": :The answer to ""who owns"" or ""who controls"" Denver's airport, however, couldn't be more boring. Like other major airports in the U.S., the short answer is: The government does.""The City and County of Denver owns and operates Denver International Airport,"" according to DIA's website. ""Under the city charter, the management, operation and control of Denver International Airport is delegated to the city's Department of Aviation. The Manager of the Department of Aviation is appointed by and reports directly to the Mayor of Denver.""Secret SocietiesA pervasive belief about the airport is related to claims about a secretive cabal that owns or controls it. The airport's website points to a capstone demarcating a time capsule as the flashpoint for this belief. The capstone reads, in part, ""The time capsule beneath this stone contains messages and memorabilia to the people of Colorado in 2094."":It also contains a symbol for the Freemasons, a generational guild which is often the focus of conspiracy theories, and the names of contributors, the first one of which is ""New World Airport Commission,"" which sounds similar to ""New World Order,"" the premise of one of the most prevalent and persistent conspiracy theories of modern times.But according to the city of Denver, that only underscores the generosity of local masonic lodges in helping with airport construction. As for the airport commission, the city said:The capstone also makes mention of a group called the New World Airport Commission. Unlike the Freemasons, this group doesn't actually exist, making its inclusion a little tougher to explain. And, as some like to point out, the name is suspiciously close to that of the so-called New World Order. But, according to a 2007 Westword article, the name is likely a reference to Czech composer Antonin Dvorak's ""New World Symphony,"" and the New World Airport Commission was simply a temporary commission created to arrange the new airport's opening festivities.:Tunnels or Structures Underneath the AirportA subset of the conspiratorial beliefs surrounding the airport holds that it contains an underground network of tunnels and structures that extend to Colorado Springs Air Force Base, or the Cheyenne Mountain Complex.But that's not true. According to the city, the reality behind these, too, are fairly mundane:Although the airport acknowledges that there are several subterranean levels beneath the main terminal (including the trains that carry passengers to and from different concourses and a long-defunct automated baggage system), they say the tunnels only extend out to the perimeter of the airport, less than two miles.They also insist that you're much more likely to meet mundane office workers than billionaires in ceremonial robes, since some of the underground levels host work and office spaces. And they're adamant that any purported evidence of space aliens is just graffiti from mischievous employees, some of whom have been known to don lizard masks to prank unsuspecting coworkers and members of the media.:'Blucifer,' the 'Demonic' Horse StatueInstalled in 2008, one of the airport's iconic fixtures is a towering statue of a rearing horse, ""Blue Mustang."" With its glowing red eyes, the sculpture has become part of the airport's lore.Adding to its imposing presence is the fact that Luis Jimenez, the artist who created the statue (known as ""Blucifer"" to locals), tragically died in an accident while constructing the piece when part of it broke off and fell on him.But the statue isn't ""demonic,"" as some assert. Jimenez's death was a tragic accident, and none of the statue's features were created with the intent to give the horse an ominous air. Jimenez's widow, Susan, explained the features in 2019 to Colorado Public Radio.The sculpture is laden with symbolism, but none of it demonic. Instead, it's a blend of references to Jimenez's personal and cultural life journey.:The red eyes are just LED flood lights, inspired by an experience Luis had at home:Susan understands that the ""eyes have been a point of focus."" She remembers a time Luis was home alone at night. He heard something in the living room and went to investigate.""He sees these two eyes,"" she said. ""And he said the hairs on the back of his neck stood up.""He had thought there was an invader in their home, but then felt a nudge from a familiar source. It was their horse Black Jack, the model for Luis' final work, who had mysteriously broken into their living room.""And so [do the eyes] have anything to do with that incident and this kind of you're afraid of something but then it's OK [because you realize] it is familiar,"" she said. ""I don't know. But the eyes do not have any evil intent whatsoever.""And the horse is blue, Susan Jimenez said, as a tribute to the family's pet horse Black Jack, who had served as the model for the sculpture. Black Jack had a coat pattern known as blue roan, a mixture of black and white hair that creates a blue appearance.:The glittery paint quality selected by Jimenez was a nod to lowrider cars, symbolic of the Chicano working class experience, Dale Kronkright, head of conservation at the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, New Mexico, explained to Colorado Public Radio."

Matt Gaetz, R-Florida, made remarks that earned him condemnation, particularly in light of the fact that U.S. Senate Republicans voted on May 28 to block a bipartisan committee to study the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.:Gaetz's fellow Republican House member, U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Illinois, for example, accused Gaetz of inciting violence:Gaetz, who is under investigation in a federal sex trafficking probe, stated during the rally in Dalton, Georgia:And so let us use the Constitution to strengthen our argument and our movement. We have a First Amendment right to speak and assemble, and we better use it. The internet's hall monitors out in Silicon Valley, they think they can suppress us, discourage us. Maybe if you're just a little less patriotic. Maybe if you just conform to their way of thinking a little more, then you'll be allowed to participate in the digital world. Well you know what? Silicon Valley can't cancel this movement, or this rally, or this congressman.We have a Second Amendment in this country, and I think we have an obligation to use it. The Second Amendment, this is a little history lesson for all the fake news media, the Second Amendment is not about, it's not about hunting, it's not about recreation, it's not about sports. The Second Amendment is about maintaining within the citizenry the ability to maintain an armed rebellion against the government if that becomes necessary. I hope it never does, but it sure is important to recognize the founding principles of this nation and make that they are fully understood.:Video of Gaetz' comment can be viewed here:It's not the first time Gaetz has made such a remark. Although he had been railing against alleged speech suppression on social media platforms, Gaetz posted a similar statement on May 28 to Twitter::He also made a similar statement on May 7, 2021, during a rally in Florida.Gaetz has been holding rallies with fellow U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, a Qanon conspiracy theory supporter who won her seat representing Georgia's 14th Congressional District after running unopposed in 2020.:Both Greene and Gaetz are vocal promoters of former U.S. President Donald Trump, who incited the attack on the Capitol with a disinformation campaign falsely alleging the election was stolen via a mass-scale voter fraud conspiracy.Four people died that day, and three police officers who defended the Capitol died in the days after. Roughly 140 police officers were injured, some seriously. As a result of this violence, Trump has been banned by mainstream social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube."

Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic have since taken the issue to court, citing defamation.:We previously debunked a number of conspiracy theories about Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic. Dominion provides a wide variety of election services, including hardware and software. Smartmatic creates and offers ""electronic voting technology and services designed to make elections more auditable and transparent."" Despite a false rumor, no, Smartmatic does not own Dominion.On Feb. 1, 2021, two QAnon supporters posted unsupported claims about Myanmar, Dominion Voting Systems, and Smartmatic. First, @FrederickSelous posted to social media about Dominion::It claimed: ""The White House is freaking out after Myanmar military arrests political leaders for election fraud in their November 8 elections. Myanmar used Dominion Voting Systems.""The post featured pictures of former U.S. President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and Aung San Suu Kyi. Suu Kyi, Mayanmar's civilian leader, was detained during the early 2021 military coup.The QAnon supporter appeared to deduce sort of malice from the dated pictures. However, they were captured during Obama's presidency in 2011 and 2012. At the time, he promised support for Myanmar from the United States.Another QAnon supporter going by the handle @MajorPatriot posted another baseless conspiracy theory. ""Look what I just found,"" read the post. It pointed to a 2017 tweet by Smartmatic and appeared to indicate that the company was involved in Myanmar's elections.:Both claims were false. Myanmar did not use Dominion Voting Systems, Smartmatic, or any other machines or electronics in its election process.In 2020, Myanmar used paper ballots that were counted by hand. No electronics appeared to have been involved. Black and blue ink were accepted. Among the many interesting ""non-sensitive"" materials required in the election were rope, candles, and lighters. Plastic baskets were also used for counting votes.::A special fact sheet for Myanmar's 2020 general election made no mention of Dominion or Smartmatic. The detailed document, provided by STEP Democracy, described the entire 2020 electoral process. This section was about vote counting:At 4:00 PM or after the last voter has left, the polling station will be closed. The polling station officer can assign other polling station staff for counting, or s/he takes on this duty him/herself.Following persons can be present inside the polling station at the opening of the ballot box and counting of the ballot papers:- Polling Station Members.- Witnesses (Candidates, Voters, Election Agents, Agents from Political Parties, etc.)- Public (Media persons, people)- Polling Station Agents.- Election Observers if present.First, the assigned staff open the Advance Voting (in-constituency) ballot box and count the votes.

(Photo by Kaung Zaw Hein/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)The Associated Press reported that the military in Myanmar ""charged that there was massive fraud in the election -- particularly with regard to voter lists -- though it has not offered any proof."" No credible evidence of purported massive voter fraud was presented regarding the 2020 U.S. presidential election either.:An Instagram video featured both false claims about Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic. It was posted on Feb. 2, 2021. It appeared to indicate that former U.S. President Donald Trump would return to the White House after a supposed upcoming military coup. The video featured the words ""the calm before the storm,"" ""are you ready,"" and other overly dramatic phrases.Following his presidency, Trump moved to his Mar-a-Lago property in Palm Beach, Florida. At the time of the military coup in Myanmar, he was preparing for his second impeachment trial. He was charged with ""incitement of insurrection.""We reached out to both Dominion and Smartmatic for comment about the possibility of any past dealings with Myanmar. A spokesperson for Dominion told us that the company has never had any voting systems in Myanmar. Smartmatic also responded: ""Smartmatic had no involvement in Myanmar's 2020 elections. In fact, Smartmatic has never provided any election technology or services to authorities in that country. Any claim to the contrary is simply false.""In sum, Myanmar did not use Dominion Voting Systems or Smartmatic for its 2020 general election. Votes were cast and counted by hand.:"
438,438,96.NoMaricopaCountyBall,"Claim:November 2020 election ballots from Maricopa County, Arizona, were destroyed in a March 6, 2021, chicken barn fire.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer took to Twitter on May 15, 2021, to state his exasperation with what he described as ""unhinged"" lies about the November 2020 election, namely a false claim by former U.S. President Donald Trump that an elections database in that Arizona county had been ""DELETED!"" by county officials.:After his tweet went viral Richer made appearances on CNN in which he denounced conspiracy theories that continue to circulate a half-year after the presidential election, driven by a recount underway in Arizona. The controversial recount is being performed by Cyber Ninjas, a private firm hired by the Republican-led Arizona Senate, led by a proponent of Trump's election disinformation campaign alleging a massive-scale vote fraud conspiracy that supposedly cost Trump the election.What Is the Conspiracy Theory About the Chickens?During an appearance on May 18, 2021, on the CNN primetime show ""Don Lemon Tonight,"" Richer stated the following when asked what the craziest conspiracy theory about the Arizona recount that he has heard:No, the craziest conspiracy theory by far is that one of the board of supervisors who happens to own a very large chicken farm took ballots from the 2020 election, fed them to 165,000 chickens and then had them incinerated. Now, what actually happened is that this poor man had a serious fire at one of his barns and 165,000 chickens did die.But the idea that they had ballots inside of them -- I mean, you know, and legitimate people indulge this. A prominent member of the state legislature indulged this in a conversation. And it is just, you know, what is going on here? That's facially laughable.:Where Did This Conspiracy Theory Originate?The chicken-ballot narrative appears to have originated with a false claim published by the pro-Trump conspiracy site Gateway Pundit, which on March 6, 2021, reported that, ""Dumpsters full of shredded ballots were located today in Maricopa County Arizona.""The Gateway Pundit story appears to have been lifted from a Facebook post from Pinal County resident Staci Burk, a pro-Trump ""Stop the Steal"" activist, who had filed a failed lawsuit challenging the 2020 presidential election results. Burk's post stated that dumpster divers had recovered shredded ballots from behind the Maricopa County ballot tabulation center, and alleged that was evidence of election malfeasance.Richer's office debunked that claim at that time. Maricopa County Elections Department spokesperson Megan Gilbertson told the Arizona Mirror in a story published March 9, 2021, that the shredded ballots weren't from the 2020 election. State law, she said, requires election officials to keep ballots for 24 months after an election is canvassed.:Gilbertson noted that the county sends out sample ballots, which are printed on the same paper as the ballots used in the election, and that such ballots are also available online. And there are many voters who received ballots in the mail but didn't return them, she said.""The ballot shown in the picture could be any one of those things. What it is not is an official voted ballot from the November General Election. The 2.1 million voted ballots from the November General Election are safe and accounted for in a vault, under 24/7 surveillance,"" Gilbertson said.Chance would have it that on March 6, tragedy struck the family business of Maricopa County District 4 Supervisor Clint Hickman, and the ""shredded ballots"" conspiracy theory metastasized.A fire broke out at the farm and destroyed two barns at the Hickman's Family Farms location roughly 50 miles west of Phoenix. In that fire, 166,000 egg-laying hens perished.:The Gateway Pundit seized on this fire, with a headline that same day that read, ""After Finding Shredded Ballots in the Dumpster Earlier Today - A Mysterious Fire Breaks Out at Maricopa County Official's Farm.""The Gateway Pundit story further reported, ""Individuals in the county found shredded ballots at this location today (Saturday, March 6th). And now tonight two barns on the farm of one of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors caught on fire,"" adding later, ""There better be a good investigation into these fires. Did any shred catch fire in the chicken coops?""A flurry of conspiratorial social media posts connecting the chicken fire to the false claims about shredded ballots followed. Here is an example of one::Is There Evidence of Ballot Destruction in the Fire?No.We reached out to the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, which is the agency investigating the cause of the fire, and the Buckeye Valley Fire District, the firefighters who responded to extinguish the blaze. Both told us there was no evidence of wrongdoing, and no evidence found that ballots were destroyed at the site.According to a fire report provided to Snopes by Buckeye Valley Fire District upon a public records request, emergency crews responded to a structure fire on Salome Highway in the city of Tonopah just after 1 p.m. A second structure also caught fire as crews battled the blaze. One person was transported to the hospital in stable condition. Maricopa Sheriffs told us in an email that, ""The investigation revealed there was no evidence of a crimes. The cause of the fire was listed as unknown. The Arson investigation revealed no election ballots."":"

A search of FEMA's press releases, Facebook account and Twitter account shows that the agency has not said any such thing.

They only need to register with FEMA for assistance.  They can do this online at disasterassistance.gov or call 1-800-621-3362.:This is just the latest in a series of false claims surrounding FEMA, and forms part of the long-standing ""FEMA camps"" conspiracy theory, which holds that the federal government is planning to build concentration camps and impose martial law in the aftermath of a natural disaster.

The president is fulfilling a promise to end the controversial program and redirect government funding away from geoengineering operations and towards other programs like roads, the aging electrical grid infrastructure and of course his proposed wall between the United States and Mexico.:""Today marks a great day for our country where we turn out [sic] backs on the secret poisoning of our skies, and look to a new future with better roads, a secure electrical grid, and a great wall to protect us from Mexico,"" said President Trump reading prepared comments out in front of a Boeing 767 which had been retrofitted for chemtrail spraying. ""And hear me you, we are not going to let scientists and other elite eggheads tell us about how to control the environment anymore. It's America first, not the skies first.""There was no truth to this article, which originated with the Nevada County Scooper, a self-described satire website:The Scooper is a satirical website is in scope and intent. Sometimes it's funny; often it is not. in scope and intent. It provides social criticism in a satirical, sometimes news-genre setting. We are not a ""fake news"" site, but rather an entertainment one. Sometimes it's just plain-old crappy writing with a few bad jokes. Our intention is not to fool or trick anyone, but obviously it happens. We firmly believe that you can soften a person's willingness to listen by injecting irony, and yes sometimes humor, into the conversation.:Not only is the site satirical in nature, but chemtrails are a debunked conspiracy theory, making it extremely difficult to tour a chemtrail plane. The photograph posted with the story, which White House Director of Social Media Dan Scavino Jr. originally posted on 17 February 2017, shows Trump touring a Boeing Dreamliner in Charleston, South Carolina::Although the inside of this plane may look unfamiliar to most commercial airline passengers, there is nothing amiss in this image. The tanks in the photograph, which conspiracy theorists may mistake for chemtrail storage, are actually water ballast tanks that are used during test flights. Wired explained the tanks' use in an article about a similar 747-8 test plane:The interiors are all business for flight test. In the front of the airplane, there are 16 water ballast tanks with another 16 in the aft end. A single ballast tank also sits closer to the middle and it looks like there's a spot for one more across the aisle.These tanks are filled with water and engineers can transfer water between the tanks during flight to shift the weight of simulated cargo or passengers. The center of gravity, or CG as pilots call it, is important to the flight characteristics of any airplane. During flight test, Boeing must ensure the plane is safe and efficient at full forward and full aft CG as well as any combination between the two."

Rating:FalseAbout this rating As any victim of 2017's Fyre Festival would surely tell you, just because someone posted something on Instagram does not mean that post was in any way a representation of reality. Case in point: a post from an Instagram user  published on 20 January 2019 alleging that President Ronald Reagan, at some indeterminate point in time, had described Nancy Pelosi as ""extremely evil""::Displaying a flawed understanding of both the constitutional power granted to United States presidents as well as standard punctuation, the poster suggested ""it's time Trump exercises his right of reduction in force and get rid of this b****"", referring to Pelosi. The post, which included hashtags such as ""#endtimes"", ""#islam"" and ""#libtards"", was the earliest reference we've found to this alleged Reagan quote. The meme has since been shared by numerous other accounts that promote the QAnon conspiracy theory.:We found no record of Reagan's ever making such a statement in any public forum. We reached out to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library to ask if there was any possibility the 40th president ever uttered anything close to these words, and Michael Pinckney, an archivist with the library, told us in response that ""I couldn't find any source for this quote. I researched President Reagan public speeches and Nancy Pelosi doesn't even show up. [I] also researched our open papers and again, her name doesn't come up."":""On a personal level,"" Pinckney told us via email, ""this doesn't sound like something President Reagan would say."" Joanne Drake, the Chief Administrative Officer for the Reagan Foundation, concurred. Via email, she told us ""President Ronald Reagan never spoke those words at any time - and never would."" Although Nancy Pelosi's time in national politics began in 1987, at the tail end of Reagan's presidency and political career, the Pelosi family and the Reagan family (both from California) have enjoyed cordial relations. At the unveiling of a Ronald Reagan statue in June 2009, for example, Nancy Reagan and Nancy Pelosi shared these words:Pelosi ... noted [President Reagan's] civility, a quality that has since all but vanished in Washington. ""Ever a gentleman, he never questioned the motives of the person because he knew people in public office loved our country and acted on behalf of the American people,"" Pelosi said.Former first lady Nancy Reagan, 87, whose last visit to the Rotunda was when her husband lay in state there five years ago, singled out the speaker among the many dignitaries gathered. ""I'm very grateful to her,"" she said. ""Everybody else, too, but particularly Nancy.""Her voice breaking, Nancy Reagan added, ""It's nice to be back under happier circumstances,"" With that, the two women, both dressed in white, warmly embraced and turned to unveil the enormous bronze likeness.:It is true that Nancy Pelosi hails from a powerful family of Baltimore Democrats. Her father, Thomas D'Alesandro Jr., ""served 22 consecutive terms in public office, from state delegate to city councilman to U.S. congressman to Baltimore mayor, followed by a low-level appointment from President John F. Kennedy to something called the Federal Renegotiation Board."" Pelosi's brother, Thomas D'Alesandro III, has also served as mayor of Baltimore.Because this quote only emerged 14 years after Reagan's death as an unattributed, unsourced Instagram meme for ""#libtards,"" because we found no evidence to support the notion that Reagan ever said anything close to these words, and because the sentiment expressed does not sound like something Ronald Reagan would say, we rate this claim as false."
442,442,613.HowtoCounterCOVID19M,"This article about COVID-19 misinformation on Chinese social media is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.Conspiracy theories about COVID-19 have accompanied the pandemic from the beginning. Crucial to managing the pandemic is mitigating the effects of misinformation, which the World Health Organization dubbed an ""infodemic.""Conspiracy theories and misinformation are global phenomena that affect people's perceptions of other countries, yet little is understood about which COVID-19 conspiracy theories are popular on Chinese social media, how this differs from misinformation on U.S. social media and what lessons this holds for countering global misinformation. As researchers who study online media and public discourse, my colleagues and I examined conspiracy theories about the origins of COVID-19 and narratives that debunk them on Sina Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter and one of the major Chinese social media platforms. :We found that popular conspiracies on Weibo about the origins of COVID-19 differ substantially from those in the U.S., with many claiming that a national government deliberately constructed the coronavirus. Conspiracy posts and posts attributing responsibility to the U.S. surged during Sino-U.S. confrontations. Surveys show that many Americans also believe COVID-19 conspiracy theories, however most of those conspiracy theories involved personalities such as Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci or unfounded alternative explanations for the illness, such as 5G, the new high-speed wireless network technology. :Weibo is one of China's largest social media platforms, with over 500 million users active monthly.AP Photo/Andy WongWe also found in our analysis of Chinese social media that debunking posts can be more effective when they come from women and influencers, who are people with large followings on social media. Debunking posts are also more effective when they cite scientists as the source. We believe these techniques could be effective not only in China but in other countries as well.Nationalism and international conflictWe collected and analyzed COVID-19 posts from a pool of 250 million Weibo users from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2020. Although conspiracy theories related to 5G, the bogus documentary ""Plandemic"" and Bill Gates were prevalent in the U.S., these conspiracy narratives were not popular on Weibo (4.95%). Prevalent conspiracy theories on Weibo centered around whether COVID-19 was deliberately made as a bioweapon by the U.S., China, Japan or another country. :The volume of conspiracy theories and debunking narratives surged during times of Chinese-U.S. conflict from January to April 2020. These include when President Donald Trump first referred to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese Virus"" on March 16; during several diplomatic conflicts around March 25, on April 21 when Trump announced a green card ban to prevent people from immigrating to the U.S.; and when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the 5G Clean Path  on April 29, which required that wireless communications entering and exiting U.S. diplomatic facilities bypass the equipment of ""untrustworthy"" communications companies like China's Huawei.During these Chinese-U.S. confrontations, we also observed a surge in posts that focused on blaming the U.S. as the original source of COVID-19. The pandemic has exacerbated a global trend toward nationalism. These two forces have given rise to vaccine nationalism, which could threaten the plan for global access to COVID-19 vaccines. Meanwhile, about 78% of Americans faulted China for its handling of the COVID-19 outbreak, according to a Pew Research Center survey. :COVID-19 is an example of how science can be distorted to divide people within a country and across nations. To understand how to effectively communicate about the pandemic, it's important to take into account the political contexts in which science and health communication occur.:Lessons for countering the COVID-19 infodemicFighting conspiracy theories is a difficult battle. Scholars of communication and psychology point out the psychological mechanisms that cause people to reject factual information if it challenges their worldview or sense of themselves.My colleagues and I offer three strategies for countering misinformation that can overcome these political and psychological hurdles. First, create a constructive media environment to inoculate the public. We suggest that political parties and media should avoid using nationalistic and politically motivated narratives when communicating about the pandemic. They should produce more messages that advocate for common interests and values for fighting the pandemic and the infodemic. We also recommend that public agencies, scholars and social media companies conduct more experiments to explore effective misinformation inoculation strategies that can help the public recognize and reject politically driven conspiracy theories. To help the public become more sophisticated in processing messages, researchers and communicators could give the public a small dose of conspiracy narratives and explicitly warn about the political motives behind these conspiracy theories. :Second, improve public awareness through deliberation.We recommend that a long-term solution to fight misinformation is to develop opportunities for conversations between people of different political orientations in order to have constructive dialogues that develop mutual understanding and to form thoughtful opinions. People with deeply divided views can have constructive conversations with each other. Vulnerable populations can be empowered to have thoughtful engagement with each other. Third, choose effective message senders and sources to correct misinformation.We suggest that social media companies and public agencies consider actively seeking help from credible influencers, and women who don't have large followings, to disseminate debunking information. Information on social media competes for public attention. Our research found that posts that came from influencers, as well as women without enormous numbers of followers, and that cited scientists or other scholars, received more likes, comments, retweets and hashtags. :The right messenger and the right information source are critical for increasing public engagement and understanding of science.Cuihua Shen and Jingwen Zhang of the University of California, Davis; Anfan Chen of the University of Science and Technology of China; and Jingbo Meng of Michigan State University contributed to this article.:Kaiping Chen, Assistant Professor of Science Communication, University of Wisconsin-MadisonThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

443,443,518.DidJusticeRuthBaderG,"At age 85, Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the oldest member of the U.S. Supreme Court.  She is also regarded as one of the court's more liberal justices, so when she was hospitalized in November 2018 after fracturing three ribs, many Democrats were fearful Ginsburg's injuries were a sign that declining health might compel her to step down from the bench in the near future -- well before the November 2020 elections that might allow the Democrats to regain the White House or a U.S. Senate majority and thus have some control over the selection of her replacement.Ginsburg's injury also prompted renewed interest in a 27 September 2018 report from the Santa Monica Observer, an article holding that Ginsburg was experiencing a recurrence of cancer and had disclosed to her law clerks and to members of the Senate Judiciary Committee members that she would be retiring in January 2019:While the Nation is preoccupied with the appointment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy, it appears there will soon be another vacancy on the US Supreme CourtU.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has had a re-occurrence of malignant melanoma, she has told her law clerks. Ginsburg was treated in 1999 for colon cancer and had surgery in 2009 for pancreatic cancer.She has told key Democratic members of the Senate about her medical condition, including ranking Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee Dianne Feinstein. This explains in part the ""take no prisoners"" attitude of the Democrats during the Kavanaugh nomination, carefully orchestrating weak 37 year old allegations against Kavanaugh by Women he barely remembers knowing in High School and College.:(The term ""malignant melanoma"" typically refers to a particular type of skin cancer that is distinct from pancreatic or colon cancer.  We found no record of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's having previously been treated for malignant melanoma.) :Curiously, no reputable news outlet reported similar information about Ginsburg at the time, nor has any reputable news outlet reported on the subject in the intervening months since the Observer's article was published -- despite the abundance of leaks in Washington that make such rumors virtually impossible to keep a secret.  Also curiously, Ginsburg's supposed retirement decision came just a few months after she had suggested she would remain on the court for another five years:Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said she hopes to stay on the Supreme Court until the age of 90.""I'm now 85,"" Ginsburg said on Sunday. ""My senior colleague, Justice John Paul Stevens, he stepped down when he was 90, so think I have about at least five more years.""She has already hired law clerks for at least two more terms.How is it that not only did an obscure Santa Monica newspaper/website seemingly manage to scoop the entire U.S. news media on a subject of momentous importance, but none of those news outlets even so much as took note of it?  Could it be that, as Santa Monica Next suggested, the Observer publishes fake news penned by non-existent staff?:Santa Monica Observer plays fast and loose with the facts.Under the ""News"" section of the Observer's website is this headline: ""Kanye West Appointed Under-Secretary of the Interior After Meeting at Trump Tower.""It is unclear whether the article is meant to be satire since there is no indication that it is different from the other, actual headlines also listed under ""News.""The other peculiar thing about The Observer is that it's unclear whether the authors are real people. The story ""Cornell University Astronomers Claim to Have Detected 234 Alien Civilizations"" is by Sarah Storkin, according to the byline on the article. However, the photograph that accompanies her byline appears to have been pulled from the online resume of one Hannah Sorkin, a university student in Staffordshire, England.Indeed, our review found that the Observer has a history of publishing scads of questionable, false, and outright ridiculous articles, ranging from conspiracy theory (""Bedridden, Sick Hillary Clinton Sends Body Double to Debate Donald Trump"") to alien encounters (""Alien Spacecraft Explodes Over Greenland, Releasing 2.1 Kilotons of Explosive Force"") to fake news (""Gov. Brown Signs Bill Allowing Dead People to Vote, As Long As They're Democrats"") to the out-and-out absurd (""YouTube Shooter Said to Be the Dwarf in the Jose Cuervo Beer Commercials"").  :And we don't really need to say much about the credibility of a source that reported rapper Kanye West was appointed ""Under-Secretary of the Interior,"" a position that hasn't existed for nearly thirty years now.  Looking behind the scenes doesn't inspire much confidence in the Observer's bona fides, either. Their listed business address corresponds to the location of the Kathmandu Boutique, which is a rather strange place from which to be running a supposed news operation.  (The Observer subsequently altered the address on their website after we questioned it.)Moreover, the site's roster of editorial staff appears to consist of a non-existent editor represented with a stolen profile picture and a couple of other writer/editors who are real but haven't published anything in the Observer in years.  Meanwhile, current Observer articles are published under the bylines of persons who aren't identified as staff at all.The Observer's publisher, David Ganezer, acknowledged in response to our inquiry that Observer writers employ pseudonyms and that the site ""frequently"" alters the dates of published material (as they did with the Ruth Bader Ginsburg article) to artificially enhance its currency.:In short, this ""news"" about an imminent Ginsburg retirement was reported exclusively by a single obscure site -- one that publishes fake news written by fake people.  In the event, Ginsburg never announced her retirement and remained on the bench until she passed away in September 2020."

According to the quote meme, the sentence appeared on pages 67 and 68 of the aforementioned diary.:We have so far been unable to find any evidence whatsoever that shows this is an actual quote from Biden's daughter.:We previously published a detailed story about rumors of the existence of a diary that allegedly belonged to Ashley Biden. Passages from the purported diary were released by the right-wing blog National File in October 2020, just one month ahead of the U.S. presidential election. The diary's authenticity has never been confirmed. That said, for good measure we skimmed through all 112 pages of the PDF file that is alleged to be a reproduction of that diary and found nothing resembling this quote. Some Facebook commenters appeared to believe the passage was real, despite the fact that the post included no links or source material of any kind. One person commented, ""Our President. Wake up America."" Other users remarked that they found the quote to be ""sick."" We even noticed one person claiming that the diary was ""clearly staged by the Biden administration.""One of the most engaged posts containing the quote meme was in a tweet from Nov. 30, 2022.::Additionally, in October 2022, the quote appeared in a post on the r/conspiracy subreddit on Reddit. So skeptical were the users of the self-described ""free thinking"" Reddit forum about the Ashley Biden quote that the top comments of the post were filled with dismissals.Despite all of the skepticism in the r/conspiracy post, the thread still showed a score of around 1,300 points, meaning that it had been believed to be real by quite a few users.This story will be updated if more details come to light, but for the present we are rating it ""Unfounded"" due to a complete lack of evidence.Note: In regard to the alleged authenticity of the diary itself, some have claimed that the FBI has issued statements confirming it is real. Fact-checking website PolitiFact has debunked this claim, issuing a rating of ""False."""
445,445,394.DidJustinTrudeauTran,"Claim:Prime Minister Justin Trudeau transferred control of the Canadian border to the United Nations.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 10 December 2018, Canadian blogger Spencer Fernando reported that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had turned the country's border security over to the international United Nations organization:The Trudeau government has betrayed the Canadian People by signing the UN Global Compact on Migration, dealing a severe blow to Canada's sovereignty.The Compact will be used by the Trudeau government to crackdown on the press (at least the ones he isn't bailing out), by trying to silence any speech that is critical of 'migration.'Additionally, the Compact begins a transfer of authority from national governments, to the centralized authority of the United Nations, turning migration (AKA control of national borders), into something dominated by supranational institutions.It's a clear step by the global elites and the Trudeau government to wipe out Canada's borders, and push our nation further in the direction of being a 'post-national state,' where Citizenship, borders, and democracy are stripped of all meaning.:The Trudeau-led Canadian government did sign on to the U.N. Global Compact for Migration on 10 December 2018, along with more than 160 other countries.  But that agreement doesn't usurp the control of national borders and hand it over to the U.N. The agreement states the opposite and makes several references to respecting sovereignty and each nation's control of their own international boundaries. Item 7 of the preamble, for example, states:This Global Compact presents a non-legally binding, cooperative framework that builds on the commitments agreed upon by Member States in the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants. It fosters international cooperation among all relevant actors on migration, acknowledging that no State can address migration alone, and upholds the sovereignty of States and their obligations under international law.And under the ""Unity of Purpose"" section, the agreement again affirms sovereignty of each state:National sovereignty: The Global Compact reaffirms the sovereign right of States to determine their national migration policy and their prerogative to govern migration within their jurisdiction, in conformity with international law. Within their sovereign jurisdiction, States may distinguish between regular and irregular migration status, including as they determine their legislative and policy measures for the implementation of the Global Compact, taking into account different national realities, policies, priorities and requirements for entry, residence and work, in accordance with international law.:Global News similarly noted of the agreement that:[T]he pact sets out a ""non-legally binding, cooperative framework,"" meaning it's more of a declaration rather than a legally binding treaty.Indeed, the pact's preamble states explicitly that it ""reaffirms the sovereign right of states to determine their national migration policy,"" meaning governments will not sign away their rights to design their migration policies by signing onto the pact -- contrary to [Conservative leader Andrew] Scheer's criticisms.Indeed, Scheer's characterization of the pact's legal authority was dismissed as ""factually incorrect"" by a former Conservative immigration minister.Chris Alexander, who served as immigration minister under Stephen Harper, tweeted that the pact ""is a political declaration, not a legally binding treaty.""The popularity of the blog post was likely the result of its similarities to the popular conspiracy theory that the United Nations is both trying to undermine the sovereignty of nation states and that it is a driving force behind global migration.:As RationalWiki points out, conspiracy theories about the New World Order, a vague idea that a nefarious secret cabal is plotting to undermine the United States, often incorporate claims about the U.N. erasing national borders:Current conspiracy theories about the UN usually portray it as the heart of an alleged ""New World Order"" (NWO), or at least implicate it as a major player in said Order. The UN effectively acts as a Rorschach test for political cranks to project their paranoia onto. Some more recent conspiratorial notions include:The UN is in cahoots with [insert favored bogeyman here]. (Popular choices include the Jews, the NWO, communists, environmentalists, ""globalists,"" corporo-fascists, Illuminati, the Catholic Church, Freemasons, Reptoids, Them, etc.).The idea of the UN instituting a world religion or the UN being a vehicle for the Antichrist has become a common trope among the rapture ready set. Jack Chick was fond of this one.[8] This idea is also shared to some extent by Jehovah's Witnesses, who consider UN to be the ""image of a wild beast"" from Revelation 13 and the ""disgusting thing that causes desolation"" mentioned in Matthew 24:15, which will soon act to destroy all other religions, and finally turn against JWs. The UN has also been accused of being the Harlot being described as ""Sitting atop the Nations, Multitudes, Languages, and Tongues""The UN has launched smaller projects such as the ""North American Union"" to gradually erase national borders.:The first-ever migration pact was signed by the majority of U.N. member states after 18 months of discussion and negotiation, despite ""vociferous"" objection by the United States under the Trump administration."
446,446,530.DidtheClintonFoundat,"Claim:Chelsea Clinton's 2010 wedding was paid for by the Clinton Foundation.Rating:UnprovenAbout this rating In mid-January 2018, a more-than-a-year-old rumor that the Clinton Foundation illegally paid for Chelsea Clinton's 2010 wedding began recirculating on social media, after the only daughter of Bill and Hillary Clinton took to Twitter to criticize United Sates President Donald Trump for disparaging African countries, El Salvador, and Haiti in an ongoing debate about immigration.:The rumor first appeared two days before the 8 November 2016 presidential election, when the document-dumping site WikiLeaks posted a hacked email between Democratic operatives seemingly discussing it. The rumor was kicked up again by supporters of President Trump after two damaging breaking news stories hit: one by the Washington Post reporting that Trump had asked during a discussion about immigration why people from ""shithole countries"" were coming to the U.S., and another by the Wall Street Journal reporting that one of Trump's attorneys had paid a six-figure sum to adult film actress Stormy Daniels to remain silent about a 2006 sexual encounter.;The unfounded Chelsea Clinton wedding rumor was pushed by the usual suspects:Chelsea loves the Haitian people. They paid for her wedding, after all. https://t.co/rYmmXiswGE-- Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) January 12, 2018:The story got a major boost by Fox News guest Tom Fitton, the head of right-wing activist organization Judicial Watch, who claimed in an interview on the conservative cable channel that Haiti got ""shafted"" by the Clinton Foundation because Chelsea's wedding and a major earthquake in Haiti took place in the same year, insinuating that funds intended for earthquake relief in Haiti were diverted to the Clintons' daughter's wedding instead:.@TomFitton: ""@ChelseaClinton's wedding was back in 2010, which was the year of the [Haiti] earthquake, and the allegation was that Foundation resources were used for Clinton's wedding."" pic.twitter.com/jK5kcr9zR5-- Fox News (@FoxNews) January 13, 2018The claim that the Clinton Foundation diverted funds from the Haiti quake to Chelsea Clinton's wedding is a reach at best, especially considering the discussion in the e-mail exchange between former Bill Clinton aides Doug Band and John Podesta on 4 January 2012 was itself nothing more than the relaying of a rumor. In it, Band told Podesta that he had caught wind of scuttlebutt regarding Chelsea Clinton's activities and the Clinton Foundation finances from a friend of a friend, as it were::I just received a call from a close friend of [Bill Clinton] who said that [Chelsea Clinton] told one of the bush 43 kids that she is conducting an internal investigation of money within the foundation from [Clinton Global Initiative] to the foundation. The bush kid then told someone else who then told an operative within the republican party I have heard more and more chatter of [Chelsea Clinton] and [Bari Lurie] talking about lots of what is going on internally to peopleNot smart...The investigation into her getting paid for campaigning, using foundation resources for her wedding and life for a decade, taxes on money from her parents....I hope that you will speak to her and end thisOnce we go down this road....The e-mail was made public as part of a trove of leaked messages which U.S. intelligence agencies reported were stolen by Russian hackers from the Democratic operatives in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election and were then handed over to WikiLeaks as part of an effort not only to not only help then-candidate Donald Trump, but also to sow social division and doubt in the American democratic process. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is currently investigating allegations of collusion between the Trump camp and Russia.:No tangible evidence has yet turned up documenting that the cost of Chelsea Clinton's 2010 wedding to investment banker Marc Mezvinsky was paid out of Clinton Foundation coffers, and it's unclear exactly what Band meant by Chelsea Clinton's using foundation ""resources"" for her wedding, or why she might have been investigating who paid for her own wedding. What is clear is that Band was talking about hearsay, and the e-mail offered only nebulous information about what was being investigated (and by whom). Adding more uncertainty to the motivations and context for the exchange was the fact that Band apparently had a sour relationship with Chelsea over his role at the Clinton Foundation.According to Bill Clinton's spokesperson, Angel Urena, Chelsea's wedding in Rhinebeck, New York was paid for by her parents, which Clinton himself reiterated on Twitter:No Clinton Foundation funds--dedicated to Haiti or otherwise--were used to pay for Chelsea's wedding. It's not only untrue, it's a personal insult to me, to Hillary, and to Chelsea and Marc. https://t.co/YEHqqYrsxW-- Bill Clinton (@BillClinton) January 13, 2018:The Clinton Foundation's finances are independently audited annually, and reports are posted to the charity's web site for public examination. Certified public accounting firm BKD audited the Clinton Foundation's finances for the year 2010 and found no evidence of any misleading or inaccurate financial statements made on Internal Revenue Service disclosure forms.The charities of both 2016 major party presidential candidates were the sources of much scrutiny and partisan flame-throwing in the months before the election, but the Clinton Foundation has been the target of an unending parade of debunked-yet-resilient conspiracy theories. Here are just a few of the many examples:o The suicide death of former Haitian official Klaus Eberwein was linked to the foundation.o A former foundation executive, Eric Braverman, had suspiciously gone ""missing."":o After giving a speech supporting Hillary Clinton's candidacy at the Democratic National Convention in 2016, Gold Star father Khizr Kahn was accused of accepting a six-figure wire transfer from the Clinton Foundation.Perhaps the most persistent conspiracy theory about the Clinton Foundation is the one with the longest legs to date: a debunked but jarring claim that Hillary Clinton made a deal to transfer 20 percent of U.S. uranium deposits to a Russian company in exchange for donations to the foundation has made it to the highest levels of government. In November 2017, the Justice Department announced it would review the Uranium One allegations.In July 2016, Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tennessee) filed fraud complaints with several federal agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service, against the Clinton Foundation. The IRS followed up by notifying Blackburn that her complaint was being referred to the Exempt Organizations Examinations office in Dallas, Texas. Meanwhile, Washington Post investigative reporter David Fahrenthold documented in detail several instances in which the Donald J. Trump Foundation violated federal rules against ""self-dealing,"" which forbid non-profit heads from using charity money for personal benefit.:In 2016, Donald Trump paid a fine to the IRS for making a political donation using Trump Foundation money. The Trump Foundation filed paperwork for dissolution in November 2017."
447,447,573.FALSEElenaKaganTiedt,"Claim:   President Obama nominated Elena Kagan for the U.S. Supreme Court as a reward for her help in getting nine challenges to his eligibility dismissed. FALSEExample:   [Collected via e-mail, August  2010]Well, someone figured out why Obama nominated Elana Kagan for theSupreme Court. Pull up the Supreme Courts website, go to the docketand search for Obama. She was the Solicitor General for all the suitsagainst him filed with the Supreme Court to show proof of natural borncitizenship.He owes her big time. All of the requests were denied of course.They were never heard. It just keeps getting deeper and deeper, doesn't it?The American people mean nothing any longer. It's all about paybacktime for those that compromised themselves to elect someone thatreally has no true right to even be there. We should be getting sosick of all of this nonsense. The USA has finally become the laughingstock of the world. GOD help and deliver us.:   Variations:   An e-mailed screed claiming that thisarticle is wrong is itself wrong.Origins:   Rumors that Elena Kagan was nominated for a position on the U.S. Supreme Court by President Barack Obama as a tit-for-tat payment of Kagan's assistance in using her position as U.S. Solicitor General to fend off lawsuits challenging Obama's eligibility for the presidency began circulating in August 2010, prompted by a 4 August 2010 online article published byWorldNetDaily (WND). That article claimed that Kagan ""has actually been playing a role forsome time in the dispute over whether Obama is legally qualified to be in the White House"" and that a ""simple search of the high court's own website reveals Kagan's name coming up at least nine times on dockets involving Obama eligibility issues,"" then went on to suggest that all nine of the referenced docket items were dismissed due to Kagan's influence, an action for which President Obama ""owes her big time"" and has rewarded her with a quid pro quo Supreme Courtnomination.:One small problem for the advocates of this political conspiracy theory: None of the nine docket items cited by WND was about ""whether Obama is legally qualified to be in the White House.""  The WND article simply cites the results of a non-specific search on all Supreme Court docket items containing the names ""Obama"" and ""Kagan"" and misleadingly claims them all as ""involving Obama eligibility issues,"" without regard for the real underlying issues of those cases.* Each of the docket items included the name of the lower court from which it was appealed, as well as a case number.  Using those pieces of information as reference points for looking up the subject of each of the cited docket items (as WND utterly failed to do) revealed that NONE of the nine entries cited by WND had anything at all to do with cases challenging Barack Obama's eligibility to hold the office of President of the United States; in fact, most of them actually stemmed from cases which were originally filed against the federal government long before the presidential candidacy of Barack Obama (but which since ""rolled over"" to the current administration).The nine entries cited by WND comprised cases filed by:: Gary William Holt, a federal prisoner in Tennessee who was convicted of firearms-related offenses and whose case is a prisoner civil rights issue filed during the Bush administration. Jerome Julius Brown, whose case not only long antedates the Obama administration, but is also largely incomprehensible and has nothing do to with eligibility issues.  The case was originally dismissed by a lower court that could not discern either ""which claims are made against which defendants on what basis"" nor what ""relief [the] plaintiff demands,"" and a description of the case provides some idea of why the lower court found it unworthy of consideration:This matter is before the Court on the Complaint filed by Plaintiff Jerome Julius Brown (""Brown""), who refers to himself as ""U.S. Bounty # 1014, U.S.A., Mr. Jerome Julius Brown Sr. et al."" On June 7, 2010, Brown filed a one-page Complaint accompanied by 167 pages of attachments. The one-page Complaint is incomprehensible. It consists of several disjointed sentence fragments that do not make sense. It refers to a ""petition for writ and attachments,"" an appeal from a magistrate judge, the United States Marshals Service, ""assessment & taxation no real property data land condemnation business check card"" and demands $70,000.00. The attachments include copies of his Maryland Driver's License, a business check card apparently issued to him by Chevy Chase Bank, and a Federal Express account card.  Other attachments demonstrate that he has filed other lawsuits against Chevy Chase Bank, and that he has filed other lawsuits against other various persons and entities. Also included among the attachments are copies of various checks drawn on what appears to be a business account for ""Zip One Mail Contractor Courier"" and ""Jerome Julius Brown,"" an ""ID Theft Affidavit"" that refers to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a credit report for Brown that includes handwritten notes regarding purported fraud and identity theft, and what appears to be a copy of a home equity loan application.: Louis Lutz, a truck driver who was employed as a U.S. Army civilian contractor in Iraq between 2004 to 2006 (long before the advent of the Obama administration) and whose case has to do with the combatant status of civilian contractors and employees working in Iraq and Afghanistan, not presidential eligibility issues.Two filings involving Abdul Hamid Abdul Salam Al-Ghizzawi, a Libyan citizen seeking release from his incarceration at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station.  (Al-Ghizzawi was finally released in March 2010, after seven years of imprisonment.) Three filings involving Jamal Kiyemba, a Ugandan who was incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station for four years beginning in 2002. (Although Kiyemba was released from  Guantanamo in 2006, due to ""some procedural detail of the American legal system, Jamal Kiyemba's name remains in the headlines of the highly public legal battle that began as Kiyemba v. Bush and which sits now on the desks of the nine justices of the Supreme Court of the United States under its new name: Kiyemba v. Obama."" The case is a separation-of-powers issue that has nothing to do with presidential eligibility.)The Real Truth About Obama, Inc., a case which, although the plaintiff's name might suggest a presidential eligibility issue, is actually a challenge to three Federal Election Commission regulations which the plaintiff organization alleges are ""unconstitutionally overbroad"" and thereby infringed their right ""to disseminate information about presidential candidate Senator Obama's position on abortion."":After we published our article on this topic, WND hurriedly scrubbed the original article from their site without explanation, then misleadingly replaced it three days later with a thoroughly rewritten article on a different topic which was prefaced by an Editor's Note acknowledging their error:Editor's Note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly described a series of cases for which Elena Kagan represented the government as eligibility cases. Those cases, in fact, were a series of unrelated disputes pending before the Supreme Court and the references have been removed from this report.Many people unfamiliar with the function of the Solictor General's office have claimed that even if the referenced docket items are not cases involving eligibility issues, they somehow demonstrate a questionable or inappropriate connection between Barack Obama and Elena Kagan, as if the latter personally represented the former in court and was rewarded for her efforts with a Supreme Court nomination.  This claim is also falseOne of the duties of the Solicitor General is, in layman's terms, to act as advocate for the United States before the Supreme Courtin any lawsuits filed against the federal government over abridgements of constitutional rights; thus the current Solicitor General's name will appear on virtually every Supreme Court docket item entered during his or her tenure.  (Indeed, a simple search of docket items for the name ""Elena Kagan"" turns up over 500 matching entries.)  Because such lawsuits often name the President of the United States as a respondent, it is also not uncommon for the current president's name to appear on such docket items (even if he was not yet in office at the time the underlying cases were originally filed in lower courts).  In all such cases, however, the Solicitor General functions as a representative of the interests of the federal government, not as personal counsel for the President.  (Several dozen Supreme Court docket items still identify Barack Obama's predecessor, George W.

448,448,319.DidThisProtestSignSu,"Claim:A photograph shows a woman holding a protest sign which reads ""Ending White Supremacy Starts with Killing All White People.""Rating:FalseAbout this rating An image purportedly showing a protester holding a sign reading ""Ending White Supremacy Starts with Killing All White People"" was spread across the internet during the Fall of 2018 by social media users typically arguing that ""liberalism is a mental disorder."":One Twitter account, for example, posted the image with the caption ""Democratic Idiot of the Day,"" and the Facebook page ""Brower Report"" provided the caption ""when the stupid flows through you.""Democratic idiot of the day pic.twitter.com/0zY7PdzJNo-- Billy Short (@BillyShortSEC) October 6, 2018The Twitter account ""ByeByeDems"" summed up this error-prone argument by stating that ""liberals are so thoroughly brain washed that they want to KILL their own race""::These comments would have carried some weight had they been based on a real photograph. The image being remarked upon, however, was digitally manipulated to add the words ""killing all"" to the phrasing. The original sign simply read: ""Ending White Supremacy Starts with White People"" (with no mention of killing anyone).Here's a look at the original photograph (left) and the doctored image (right)::The original photograph has been online since August 2017 and was most likely taken at a counter-protest to the ""Unite The Right Rally,"" a white supremacist event held in Charlottesville, Virginia, that resulted in the death of one person. The pictured protester was urging ""white people"" to do their part in ending racism, similar to a number of other protest signs seen at the rally, including one in the background of this photograph which reads ""White America: It's on us. Fight White Supremacism.""<!--Although the notion of a ""white genocide"" has been a major talking point of the alt-right, white nationalist, and neo-Nazi communities for a number of years, President Trump helped put this idea into the mainstream when he tweeted about the ""large scale killing"" of farmers in South Africa in August 2018:The idea that there is a 'genocide' of white farmers in South Africa was once the province of conspiracy theorists but, thanks to News Corp's media promotion, it has moved into the policy realm.On Wednesday night, the Fox News presenter Tucker Carlson once again talked about the alleged plight of white South African farmers on his Fox News program.On Twitter, Donald Trump indicated that he had been watching. The president's tweet called for further study, but treated the ""large scale killing of farmers"" as a settled fact, when reporting indicates that against the background of a generally high murder rate in South Africa, there is no evidence of white farmers being specifically targeted.But Trump's tweet came at the end of a long process whereby the far-right idea of ""white genocide"" in South Africa had been mainstreamed, working its way from far-right websites and forums, into the rightward edge of mainstream media, and then into policy proposals. News Corp outlets have played an outsized role in that process.The conspiracy theory of ""white genocide"" has been a staple of the racist far right for decades. It has taken many forms, but all of them imagine that there is a plot to either replace, remove or simply liquidate white populations.:It appears that the words ""killing all"" were added to this image just a few days after President Trump posted this tweet.-->"

Ilhan Omar, who represents Minnesota's 5th Congressional District. Omar is one of the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress and the first to wear a traditional head scarf, an achievement that has also made her a target for racist attacks.It also plays off overarching biases against Muslim people and immigrants, notably ""creeping sharia,"" the Islamophobic conspiracy theory that Muslim people are plotting to take over.Minnesota has between roughly 42,400 and 55,200 people of Somali heritage, not ""hundreds of thousands."" The population makes up 1 percent of the state's total. And although Minnesota public school students can opt to learn Arabic, it is only one foreign-language offering.

450,450,377.DidBuzzAldrinRevealt,"Claim:Voice analysis of Buzz Aldrin and other former astronauts revealed the existence of extraterrestrials.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 8 April 2018, an English tabloid attempted to pass off a long-debunked conspiracy theory about astronaut Buzz Aldrin and three of his peers as an ""exclusive"" by involving a questionable research group.According to the London-based Daily Star, Aldrin -- as well as Gordon Cooper, Edgar Mitchell, and Al Worden -- ""took part"" in a study by the Institute of BioAcoustic Biology in the United States. The fact that Cooper and Mitchell are both dead is not mentioned until the story's penultimate paragraph.:Despite stating in its headline that Aldrin (who piloted the Apollo 11 mission in 1969)  passed a ""lie detector test,"" the Star reported that the four astronauts' ""participation"" consisted of an alleged analysis of recordings of the two men's voices. But there is no mention of which recordings were covered by the ""complex computer analyses"" of their voice patterns; instead, the Star reported that ""these studies are claimed to be more reliable than current lie detector tests and could soon replace those used by the FBI and police,"" without stating exactly who is making said claim:Aldrin has always maintained he spotted a UFO on the way to the moon, saying: ""There was something out there that was close enough to be observed, sort of L-shaped.""The tabloid also reported that Sharry Edwards, who heads the Ohio-based institute, said that even though Aldwin ""cannot explain it,"" he is somehow sure that he saw a non-terrestrial spacecraft. But the tabloid did not mention that Aldrin himself said during a Reddit ""Ask Me Anything"" chat session on 8 July 2014 that what he saw was likely not anything extraterrestrial::There were many explanations of what that could be, other than another spacecraft from another country or another world - it was either the rocket we had separated from, or the 4 panels that moved away when we extracted the lander from the rocket and we were nose to nose with the two spacecraft. So in the close vicinity, moving away, were 4 panels. And i feel absolutely convinced that we were looking at the sun reflected off of one of these panels. Which one? I don't know. So technically, the definition could be ""unidentified.""We reached out to Aldrin seeking comment but did not hear back prior to publication; a spokesperson for him told the Australian web site Pedestrian, ""This is bogus and we don't know where it came from.""Aldrin's spokesperson also emailed us to rebut the allegation, saying:Buzz did not take a lie detector test. He has never said he saw a UFO. This story has been a fabrication for the sake of headlines and is not true as far as Buzz Aldrin is concerned. We think they've twisted one of his interviews to mean something it does not. Buzz has always been very clear that he never saw any UFO's or anything to indicate we've been contacted by alien life. So this is someone just trying to capitalize on using his name to get press.:Bioacoustics -- the institute's alleged field of expertise -- is a legitimate realm of scientific study, dating back to the work of biologist Ivan Regen in 1925. But as ScienceAlert.com once said of Edwards' group, ""the institute's line of study bears the hallmarks of pseudoscience."""
451,451,374.DidMexicanDrugCartel,"Claim:Officials say the October 2017 California wildfires were started by Mexican drug cartels in order to gain a strategic advantage over the legal marijuana industry.Rating:UnprovenAbout this rating As wildfires caused devastation in parts of California in the fall of 2017, conspiracy theories about their causes followed quickly behind. On 14 October 2017, the web site Got News claimed that law enforcement officials and cannabis industry figures believe that Mexican drug cartels are to blame for starting the fires: :Law enforcement officials and legal marijuana industry leaders alike are beginning to suspect the Mexican drug cartels played a role in starting the deadly fires.While massive wildfires are far from uncommon in California's forests, they usually occur in December and January, not October. Moreover, this year's have widely been described as unprecedented in size and destruction. Some 16 fires have burned over 200,000 acres of land in Northern California so far....Law enforcement authorities - including senior Department of Homeland Security officials - and key people within the legal marijuana business quickly noticed that the areas hit hardest by the fires are the same places that California's marijuana industry legally grows cannabis, and are now starting to suspect foul play.The suspicious timing and sheer destruction of the fires has led them to believe the Mexican drug cartels - infamous for their ruthless tactics - had a hand in starting them.The article cites stories by the New York Times and NBC News, who reported that among the areas damaged by the fires are several cannabis farms. Similar versions of this conspiracy theory were also picked up and published by Proud Patriots, Freedom Daily, and the Gateway Pundit. :The Got News article can most charitably be described as thinly sourced, claiming that anonymous law enforcement officials and cannabis industry leaders believe that cartels ""had a hand"" in starting the historically destructive fires. However, there is no statement attributed to anyone, even an unnamed person.  A spokesperson for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection told us the investigation into the fires was still ongoing and that it could be a matter of months before a cause or causes are determined. However, there is ample evidence to implicate windblown power lines in at least some of the wildfires: Investigators have yet to determine what sparked the Northern California fires.But a review of emergency radio traffic recordings found that fire crews were dispatched to at least 10 spots in Sonoma County in response to reports of sparking electrical wires and exploding transformers as high winds pummeled the area on the night of Oct. 8, the San Jose Mercury News reported. The first fires were reported about the same time, the newspaper said.:Although it doesn't contain any evidence to support its central claim, the Got News article does contain references to earlier reporting about the damage that wildfires have caused to marijuana crops in California. For example, it quotes an 13 October 2017 New York Times report: Fatal fires that have consumed nearly 200,000 acres in Northern California, devastating the region's vineyards particularly in Napa and Sonoma Counties, are also taking a toll on a fledgling industry just months before its debut: recreational marijuana.Many of the region's farms, including those that harvest cannabis, have been scorched, including those in Sonoma County and in Mendocino County, the center of California's marijuana industry. According to an NBC News report: For many producers, the financial losses include not just harvest-ready crops, but recent investments in infrastructure to comply with licensing regulations in preparation for recreational marijuana legalization next year.:Both these articles were about the effects of the fires on the marijuana crop, an industry that has economically transformed the region and whose loss affects a significant number of residents. Neither of these source articles contain any mention of drug cartels, nor any speculation about what (or who) might have caused the wildfires in the first place. The fact that California's nascent legal marijuana industry has been badly affected by the fires does not, of course, logically require or even suggest that the fire was started by those involved in the illegal drug trade. The article also claims that the timing of the October 2017 wildfires is ""suspicious,"" adding that ""they usually occur in December and January, not October."" This is false; October, as any Californian can tell you, is the height of fire season. In fact, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's annual wildfire reports show that there were more wildfires in October than both January and December, every year between 2008 and 2015, apart from 2014, when January saw 283 fires, as opposed to 172 in October. According to statistics published by the California's Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, arson (the cause claimed by Got News) was responsible for just 0.37 percent of the 291,282 acres of land burned by wildfires in the state in 2015 and 7.8 percent of fires overall. Electrical power lines and electrical equipment caused 76 percent of wildfire damage between them. :Got News is a disreputable web site run by the infamous internet troll Chuck C. Johnson, and has previously published thinly sourced and fabricated claims and often-xenophobic conspiracy theories.  "

Rating:FalseAbout this rating In February 2019, a rumor circulated on social media that Jussi Smollett, the Empire actor accused of making false claims about being the victim of a hate crime, was the nephew of Democratic U.S. senator (and presidential candidate) Kamala Harris of California.0:00 / 0:00       Conservative radio host Kevin McCullough was one Twitter user who promoted the notion that Harris was Smollett's aunt::McCullough deleted his tweet after it generated a considerable amount of ridicule.The claim that Kamala Harris is Jussie Smollett's aunt was offered by a number of social media users, but the documentation presented with it was flimsy at best. In fact, the most substantial piece of ""evidence"" presented to support this conspiracy theory was that Smollett's mother and the California senator share a surname::Sharing a last name does not constitute proof that these two women are siblings, however. In fact, the surname ""Harris"" is one of the most popular surnames in the United States, ranking in the top 30 of the 2010 U.S. Census.  We've examined the biographical information available for these two public figures and found that their family branches simply do not intersect.  :Kamala Harris, who was born in Oakland, California, has a single sibling, a younger sister named Maya who was born in Illinois. In order for Kamala to be Jussie Smollett's aunt, Maya -- who is only 16 years older than Smollett -- would have to his mother.  However, Smollett's mother's first name is Janet, not Maya, and she is from New Orleans, not Illinois.  Neither did we find any familial relationship between Kamala Harris and the Smollett family through marriage that might provide a basis for referring to Kamala as Jussie's ""aunt."" Jussie Smollett was born in Santa Rosa, California, to Janet (Harris) Smollett and Joel Smollett Sr. (who migrated to the U.S. from Russia and Poland).  Jussie said the family moved to Queens when he was two years old, and afterwards, according to the New York Times, he grew up ""bouncing with [his] parents and siblings between New York and Los Angeles, as the kids pursued careers in modeling, acting and music.""Neither Kamala Harris' husband, Douglas Emhoff, nor Maya Harris' husband, Tony West, has any discernible connection to Jussie's parents.   Emhoff hails from New York, graduated USC law school, is a prominent entertainment and intellectual property lawyer in Los Angeles, and has two grown children from a previous relationship.  West hails from San Francisco, graduated Stanford  law school, serves as general counsel and Chief Legal Officer at Uber, and has one daughter with his wife Maya.:"
454,454,367.HasanIndictmentBeenI,"Claim:A Maryland man has been indicted in connection with the Uranium One investigation.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 12 January 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an eleven-count indictment against a Maryland man who is accused of bribing a former Russian energy official in a scheme to win nuclear fuel transportation contracts for his company. Although on its face it appears to be a straightforward story of corruption, the indictment has become conflated with one of the most fevered post-election 2016 conspiracy theories -- Uranium One.:Mark Lambert, 54, of Mount Airy, Maryland is facing multiple counts of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), wire fraud, and money laundering. He is accused of scheming to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a former Russian official at TENEX (a subsidiary of Russia's State Atomic Energy Corporation, better known as Rosatom) into securing contracts for his firm, identified in court documents as ""Transportation Company A."" Mikerin and Daren Condrey, a third man named in the indictment, both pleaded guilty to related charges in 2015. The 24-page indictment filed on 10 January 2018 in federal court in Maryland makes no mention of the Clintons, their charitable foundation, or Uranium One.According to court documents and Justice Department statements, Lambert and Condrey were co-presidents of the Maryland firm Transport Logistics International whose corruption scheme dates back as early as 2004. Lambert is accused of, and Condrey plead guilty to, conspiring to provide to Mikerin ""kickback payments"" in exchange for defrauding TENEX by ""causing contracts for the shipment of uranium from Russia to the U.S. to be awarded to the U.S. defendants and their companies without having to compete for the contracts."":Lambert's attorney William Sullivan told us, ""We vigorously deny the allegations included in the indictment and look forward to defeating them in court."" He declined to comment further. Lambert is scheduled to be arraigned on 25 January 2018.The conspiracy theory posits that in 2010, Hillary Clinton was bribed in her capacity as Secretary of State into transferring control of a portion of U.S. uranium deposits to the Russian owners of the Canadian mining firm Uranium One in exchange for a donation to the Clinton Foundation. Although it has gained steam both in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election (which Clinton ultimately lost to Republican rival Donald Trump) and one year later amid a special counsel probe of alleged collusion between President Trump's associates and Russia, there is no evidence Clinton was bribed or that she was personally involved in the approval of the sale.Perhaps because the indictment contains the Pavlovian buzzword ""uranium,"" it has been widely reported as being related to the Uranium One deal although no basis in fact has been offered demonstrating how the two cases are related. Other than Rosatom, uranium and a shared witness who was reportedly so unreliable he was dropped from the Justice Department's investigation into Mikerin, no credible evidence of a connection between the Lambert indictment and the Uranium One sale has been made public.:The only news outlet we could locate that accurately reported the story was the 135-year-old local newspaper, the Frederick News-Post. Otherwise, nationally-oriented blogs and cable news reported information that they did not bother to support with facts, drawing on the tangential similarities between the two cases and presenting them to their audiences as one and the same, leading many to falsely believe an indictment has been issued in a Uranium One investigation.The first instance we could find of the leap being made from the Uranium One conspiracy to the Lambert indictment was DailyWire.com, a web site owned by right wing commentator Ben Shapiro, which on 12 January 2018 ran the headline ""BREAKING: Indictment Handed Out In Russian Bribery Case Involving Uranium One, Hillary Clinton.""The next day the tabloid-type paper the New York Post reported a similar story. From there, the unfounded story traveled far and wide, picked up by a host of popular right wing blogs like Breitbart.com, Townhall.com and TheBlaze.com. But it was also given a major signal boost by ostensibly more reputable outlets Fox News and The Hill, a news web site that focuses on Capitol Hill. To cap it all off, NewsBusters.com, a web site that claims to seek out and ""bust"" liberal bias in the news media, reported without irony that the major news networks had avoided the baseless story::Where the major three networks failed, Fox News Channel's Fox & Friends didn't. ""An indictment in the Uranium One scandal, Mark Lambert the former head of a Maryland transit firm is accused of bribing Russians for nuclear contracts,"" announced co-host Steve Doocy and he was introducing Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton."

During his two terms in office not an aspect of Obama's life went untainted by rumor and gossip, from his religious beliefs to his citizenship to his allegiance to his country. These were the most popular of all the Obama fact checks we completed:10 -- President Obama declared his family would move to Canada if Trump was electedFalse -- In August 2016, at the height of that year's U.S. presidential campaign, a satirical news site posted a spoof declaring that President Obama was seriously considering moving to Canada if Donald Trump won the election. All it took was a few right-leaning web sites reposting it without a ""satire"" disclaimer to prompt an all-out sharing frenzy. Read the full report here.:9 -- President Obama confirmed he would refuse to leave office if Trump was electedFalse -- Ironically, the same fake news site that managed to convince thousands that Obama might flee to Canada racked up even more hits the following month by claiming he would refuse to leave office if Trump were elected. Doubly ironic was the fact that the same constituency that bought into the former bought into the latter, and made it go viral. Read the full report here.8 -- House Republicans scheduled Obama impeachment hearingsFalse -- Two different fake news articles from two different web sites made the precisely same false claim in July 2013: that President Obama was on the verge of being impeached by Congress.

Read the full report here.:7 -- Barack Obama's birth certificate is a forgeryFalse -- Groundless skepticism about the legitimacy of Obama's U.S. citizenship gave rise to ""birtherism,"" a labyrinthine conspiracy theory holding that he was born on foreign soil, lied about being born in Hawaii, and produced forged documents when asked to release his birth certificate. None of these claims were supported by evidence. Read the full report here.6 -- President Obama issued 923 executive orders, giving him unprecedented powerFalse -- All modern U.S. presidents have made prodigious use of the official directives known as executive orders to further their agendas. By the end of his two terms, President Obama had issued fewer executive orders (279) than either George W. Bush (291) or Bill Clinton (308), but rumor nonetheless had it that the number topped 900 within Obama's first three years.

456,456,70.ConspiracyTheoristsA,"Two conspiracy theorists who have relentlessly harassed survivors and families of victims of the 5 November 2017 mass shooting at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, have been arrested, according to Sherri Pomeroy, the wife of the church pastor.Jodi Mann, 56, otherwise known as the ""Conspiracy Granny,"" and Robert Ussery, 54, also known as ""Side Thorn Journalist,"" were arrested after trespassing on the church property and taken into custody on 4 March 2018, according to the San Antonio Express-News, which broke the story.At that time, Wilson County Sheriff's officials told the paper that booking information could not be made public because the process was not yet complete. One day later, after several phone calls and an email, Wilson County Sheriff's Office refused to give us this public information, but would not explain why.We left a message for Ussery seeking comment but have not received a response.:Sherri Pomeroy told us that Ussery and Mann were apprehended when they went onto church property, painted on a memorial poster, and screamed obscenities at her husband, Pastor Frank Pomeroy. The pair, along with many other conspiracy theorists, believe that the Pomeroys' 14-year-old daughter Annabelle -- who was among 26 people killed in the massacre -- never existed, and that the incident was a ""false flag"" or crisis manufactured by the government for the purpose of seizing guns and power.Sherri Pomeroy told us, ""It's been ongoing, almost from the first day it happened. They call it a drill from Homeland Security and say that none of it happened.""Her husband told the Express-News that Ussery had threatened him and that he ""... continually yelled and screamed and hollered and told me he was gonna hang me from a tree, and pee on me while I'm hanging.""Ussery and Mann have gone so far as to demand Annabelle's birth and death certificates from her parents and film themselves harassing the couple and their neighbors.:Ussery's web site contains a collection of videos where he films himself tormenting the community in a deranged quest to prove that the shooting never happened. In one disturbing YouTube post, he calls a woman whose sister and niece were killed in the shooting, and as she sobbingly tells him how much he has contributed to her family's suffering, Ussery says asks ""So are those tears painted on, or, just like at the vigil? You knew these people personally? You saw their bodies? You have proof?"" (After we contacted YouTube about the video, it was removed).When the woman says she had to personally identify the bodies of her murdered sister and niece, Ussery says, ""Now we know that you're lying, so. You're gonna be able to provide this in a courtroom, correct?"" He goes on to taunt and laughs at her while she sobs and screams into the phone.Calling the loved ones of mass shooting victims and tormenting them on video is not an uncommon truther tactic, said Ryan Graney, who has for years volunteered as a media representative for the family of Victoria Soto, a teacher who died shielding her students from yet another mass shooter at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut in 2012. Graney said::They do it to be Internet famous within their little circle of hoaxers. On TV you'll see the families crying and grieving, and these hoaxers try and break into their real lives. It's like a trophy for them to get a reaction out of these people. And it's sick and it's crazy.Ussery and Mann aren't the first ""truthers"" to face criminal charges after taking their internet stalking into the real world. In 2017 a Florida woman was sentenced to prison time for threatening the father of a child killed in Newtown. That same year a New York man was arrested for making threatening phone calls to the Sandy Hook medical examiner.Graney said Matthew Mills, who in 2016 received a suspended sentence for harassing Soto's family, had managed to slip into an annual race held every year to memorialize the teacher by purchasing a T-shirt, staying until the end of the event, then finally confronting Soto's sister Jillian and trying to evade police. Another ""truther,"" she said, followed the family into a federal court, took notes, and snickered at the sight of tears.:Sherri Pomeroy said of Ussery's behavior, ""We think he's demonic or demented. One or the other.""The ""false flag"" and ""crisis actor"" tropes are recycled during and after every mass shooting and are held together with a web of inference, fearmongering, and speculation (without any supporting evidence whatsoever). They often result in years of ongoing and frightening harassment of mass shooting survivors and families who lost loved ones."
457,457,60.DoesThisPhotographSh,"Claim:A photograph of Cesar Sayoc and Israel ""Izzy"" Hernandez is evidence of a Democrat-orchestrated ""false flag"" operation.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In October 2018, a series of mail-bombs sent to high-profile Democratic party figures including former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Hillary Clinton prompted intensive news coverage, especially after investigators arrested 56-year-old Florida man Cesar Sayoc, a supporter of President Donald Trump who promoted right-wing conspiracy theories online. :Although none of the 13 homemade bombs detonated or caused any physical injury, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Christopher Wray emphasized that the packages were ""not hoax devices.""Along with widespread news coverage, the episode engendered several conspiracy theories, most notably one which held that the bombing campaign was a hoax and a ""false flag"" operation orchestrated not by a right-wing extremist, but rather by liberals hoping to artificially stoke outrage against President Trump and his supporters, to the benefit of Democratic candidates in the November 2018 elections. Promoters of the ""false flag"" theory claimed that their proof lay in the fact that United States Postal Service workers do not directly deliver mail to the homes of Secret Service protectees like Obama and Clinton, and that the stamps on one of the packages were not postmarked, which purportedly meant the package couldn't have been mailed via USPS, and that the story was therefore a hoax. On 27 October, another strand to this theory emerged when social media users began sharing a photograph which appeared to show Sayoc posing with another man, named as ""Izzy Hernandez,"" who the viral memes claimed was a ""known Democrat"" donor or supporter.:According to conspiracy theorists, this proved that the pipe-bombing suspect was connected with the Democratic party, and that the entire affair was therefore a liberal-orchestrated ""false flag"" operation. On Facebook, Alan Reynolds posted the photograph along with this description:PIPE BOMBER SUSPECT pictured last year with Izzy Hernandez. Sayok [sic] does not appear destitute. In addition, why would a Trump enthusiast attend a banquet and have a photo OP with a Democrat Donor/Supporter? Facebook keeps trying to take down this photo,,,pls share this ASAP!The following day, the Twitter account @WhoWolfe posted a similar explanation::The fake bomber suspect is pictured here with Izzy Hernandez just last year. He doesn't appear to be destitute. Why would an alleged @realDonaldTrump enthusiast attend a banquet and take pictures in a photo OP with a known Democrat? Facebook has been taking this picture down.That version of the theory was retweeted by the prominent right-wing commentator Ann Coulter:Why do Facebook & Twitter immediately delete accounts of nuts at all? So we can rely on the media to tell us what they've posted? Why not let everyone see? https://t.co/qhmvFshdaw-- Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) October 28, 2018 Background:The photograph is authentic, and appears to have been taken from Sayoc's Facebook profile before administrators removed it in the aftermath of his arrest.It does indeed show Sayoc posing with Izzy Hernandez, but there is a perfectly simple explanation for the connection between the two men, one which does not require any dark, politically-motivated conspiracy to subvert democracy in the United States -- they played soccer and went to college together. Israel Abel ""Izzy"" Hernandez is a 2009 inductee into the North Carolina Soccer Hall of Fame, primarily for his accomplishments as a coach, but also as a player. His Hall of Fame profile describes his career as follows:Izzy's record of achievement is long: 9 women's high school state titles & 2 men's state titles & final NSCAA national # 1 ranking of high school teams twice, in 2006 with the girls and in 2007 with the boys & Broughton girls nationally ranked 15 consecutive years & 3 girls youth state championships (twice with the 77 CASL Spartans in U16 and U18 and once with the U18 Durham/Chapel Hill Triangle Strikers) & 2 boys youth state championships (76 Raleigh Rowdies in U13 and 74 Raleigh Express in U15) & US Youth Soccer Southern Regional champion and National Champion in 1995 with the 77 CASL Spartans, North Carolina's first youth national championship in soccer & NC Soccer Coaches Association regional coach of the year & Broughton Sports Hall of Fame & News and Observer Tar Heel of the Week. :As a young man, he played soccer for Elon College (now Elon University) in North Carolina, and before that, from 1980 to 1982, for Brevard College, a small liberal arts college in Brevard, North Carolina. One of his teammates at Brevard was Cesar Sayoc. Brevard College's 1981 yearbook shows the two sitting next to each other in the front row of the soccer team photograph, with Hernandez wearing the number 20, and Sayoc wearing the number 12::Hernandez and Sayoc were also members of the Brevard College Catholic Club together, in 1981. (Hernandez is circled on the left, Sayoc is circled on the right):Some 34 years later, Hernandez and Sayoc were photographed together again at a 2 October 2015 event in which their former soccer coach Bob Scarborough was inducted into Brevard College's Athletic Hall of Fame.:A photograph posted to Flickr by Brevard College shows Hernandez and Sayoc (second and fourth from left) celebrating with Scarborough (third from left.) Brevard College/FlickrIn the 2015 photograph, Sayoc and Hernandez are wearing the exact same outfits shown in the photograph that went viral as part of the ""false flag"" conspiracy theory, strongly indicating that the two men were photographed together at no more than a celebration in honor of their former college soccer coach Bob Scarborough. :This also disproves the claim that the photograph showed the two men together ""just last year."" In fact, the photograph was taken in 2015, not 2017. In the aftermath of Sayoc's arrest, Scarborough told the Raleigh, North Carolina TV station WRAL that his former player had kept in touch with him over the years, providing intermittent updates on his life and career developments, but that he hadn't heard from him since the October 2015 Hall of Fame induction celebration:Not only is there no evidence whatsoever that Sayoc and Hernandez are co-conspirators in a liberal plot to generate outrage against President Donald Trump and Republicans by engaging in a mail-bombing hoax, the only piece of evidence cited as proof of that claim actually points firmly in a very different direction.:'A Known Democrat'There is also no evidence to support the second component of this particular strand of the ""false flag"" conspiracy theory -- that Hernandez is a Democratic donor or supporter -- and there is some evidence to contradict it. As we have shown, Sayoc and Hernandez knew each other from playing soccer together at college in the early 1980s, so even if either or both men were at some point supporters of or contributors to either the Democratic or Republican party, their having been photographed together could easily be explained by something other than a political conspiracy. Even so, Hernandez does not appear to be a Democrat, at least not in any formal sense. According to records held by the North Carolina State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement, Israel Abel Hernandez is registered in Wake County as an ""unaffiliated voter"" (that is, as an independent.):His voting history shows that, aside from general elections, his only participation in a partisan primary came on 15 March 2016, when he cast a ballot in North Carolina's Republican presidential primary. In North Carolina, unaffiliated voters can only vote in one party's primary election, not both. Despite searching campaign finance records held by both the Federal Election Commission and the North Carolina State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement, we could find no record whatsoever of Hernandez having made any donations to a political candidate or committee of any kind. We are emphatically not suggesting that Izzy Hernandez's voting history or political affiliation (or lack thereof) is of any particular meaning or relevance.However, the lack of any evidence that he is a Democratic supporter or donor even further undermines the October 2018 meme which took a photograph of two old soccer teammates reunited three decades after their college days, and attempted, without any factual basis, to twist it into a dark and violent political conspiracy.:"

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, was mentioned in an online . It read: ""[Photos] Marjorie Taylor Greene's Husband Might Look Familiar."" The ad led to a lengthy, multi-page slideshow story with the headline: ""Celebrity Marriages: The Shortest - and Longest - in Hollywood History."":However, this was misleading. Greene's husband is not a celebrity. Her husband, Perry Greene, was listed as the president of Taylor Commercial, Inc. The company was described as ""a professional general contractor, headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia."":Further, the Greene family never ended up appearing on any page in the slideshow article. The ad was misleading clickbait ""arbitrage.""According to this U.S. House of Representatives page, she has been married to him for 23 years. They have three children.Rep. Greene previously made headlines about her ""incendiary words"" and belief in the QAnon conspiracy theory. On Jan. 4, she wore a ""Stop the [2020 Election] Steal"" mask on the steps of the Capitol. A deadly riot inspired by the same movement occurred at the Capitol two days later.On Feb. 4, 2021, The Associated Press (AP) reported that she had been removed from her committee assignments:WASHINGTON (AP) -- Freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, has been stripped of her committee assignments by the House Democratic majority over racist remarks, her embrace of conspiracy theories, and her past endorsement of violence against leading Democratic officials.Greene, 46, is a newcomer to politics, and previously worked for her family's construction business in Georgia. She was labeled a ""future Republican Star"" by former President Donald Trump, whose political style she emulates. The House Democrats took the unusual step on Thursday.:The story detailed several controversial takes by Greene. For example, she once suggested that the deadly 2017 shooting spree in Las Vegas had been staged. Greene could also be seen in a video hounding a student survivor of the Parkland school massacre.When California was subjected to wildfires in 2018, she appeared to blame space lasers and referenced Jewish people. She also suggested that a plane didn't hit the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001, and liked a comment that claimed the U.S. government carried out the attacks. Other controversies were covered in the AP story as well.The ""might look familiar"" text is a staple of misleading online s. For example, we previously reported on an ad that falsely claimed actress Sandra Bullock's young son ""might look familiar."" It also appeared to falsely claim that actor Keanu Reeves was her son.In sum, an online  appeared to claim that Greene's husband was a ""familiar"" celebrity. However, the resulting article never ended up mentioning the Greene family at all. Her husband, Perry Greene, works at a construction company in Georgia.:Snopes debunks a wide range of content, and online s are no exception. Misleading ads often lead to obscure websites that host lengthy slideshow articles with lots of pages. It's called advertising ""arbitrage.""

The perfect set up.For training purposes, U.S. fighter planes assigned to ""aggressor squadrons"" (a la Top Gun) are often repainted to resemble the aircraft of potential adversaries. There's nothing novel or unusual about it. In fact, the Marine Corps publicizes the practice.Three of the viral images offered different views of an F/A-18 Hornet strike fighter redone to look something like a Russian Sukhoi Su-34 (actual plane shown in the lower-right-hand photo)::As to the notion that the repainted F/A-18s could fly ""low and slow"" before attacking, allowing witnesses to take cell phone photos which would then be used to deceive the world into thinking that Russia was behind it, there's a rather large hole in that conspiracy theory. No matter how they're painted, the Hornet and Sukhoi planes are shaped very differently. A subset of social media users conversant in aviation would recognize the former as American-made in no time."
460,460,537.DidBillGatesAdmitVac,"Claim:Bill Gates has openly admitted that vaccinations are designed so that governments can depopulate the world.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 21 January 2016, dubious news and conspiracy theory site Your News Wire (now NewsPunch) published an article with the headline ""Bill Gates Admits 'Vaccines Are Best Way to Depopulate'"". The article opened with a damning assertion: ""Bill Gates has openly admitted that vaccinations are designed so that governments can depopulate the world."":To support this claim, the site presented a February 2011 video clip of Bill Gates being interviewed by CNN's Sanjay Gupta about his foundation's vaccination efforts:Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Ten billion dollars over the next 10 years to make it ""the year of the vaccines."" What does that mean exactly?Bill Gates: Over this decade, we believe unbelievable progress can be made, in both inventing new vaccines and making sure they get out to all the children who need them ... We only need about six or seven more -- and then you would have all the tools to reduce childhood death, reduce population growth, and everything -- the stability, the environment -- benefits from that.To make sure the point was not lost on the reader, Your News Wire repeated the ""reduce population growth"" emphasized above numerous times at a variety of different playback speeds, as if to suggest this were a slip of the tongue revealing some nefarious secret. This narrative was reinforced with another video that opens with this text:Next are two short excerpts from a recently filmed TED presentation (Feb 2010) by none other than Bill ""Microsoft"" Gates ... As Gates casually addresses the issue [of reducing carbon emissions], he goes on to state that one way to accomplish this goal is to reduce the global human population.In the first clip you will hear him state in plain language that he considers VACCINES to be desirable to that end. You will also casually hear him promoting HEALTH CARE and REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES, to accomplish that same goal.In the second excerpt you will hear Gates again confirming his profound affection for vaccinesThe damming moment, according to Your News Wire was the following statement from Gates: ""First, we've got population. The world today has 6.8 billion people. That's headed up to about nine billion. Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent ...""The suggestion, hinted at by both of these clips and argued later in the article, was that Gates knows vaccines are dangerous -- and he is using this information to kill children in the developing world to stem population growth. In reality, however, Gates' statements regarding vaccines and population growth were neither an accidental slip nor a nefarious admission of plans for a new world order.:As discussed in a 21 November 2011 Forbes cover story profiling the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, reducing population growth has always been integral to their stated mission of ""improving people's health and giving them the chance to lift themselves out of hunger and extreme poverty"":In 1997, when he and Melinda first ventured into public health ... they focused on birth control, funding a Johns Hopkins effort to use computers to help women in the developing world learn about contraception. The logic was crisp and Bill Gates-friendly. Health = resources / people. And since resources, as Gates noted, are relatively fixed, the answer lay in population control.As further discussed in this piece, Gates later came to the conclusion that birth control was not the best approach to achieve the goal of slower population growth, instead realizing that -- counterintuitively -- a reduction in childhood mortality was the best way to limit population growth:In society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls--specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people--the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes. ""It goes against common sense,"" Gates says. Most parents don't choose to have eight children because they want to have big families, it turns out, but because they know many of their children will die.""If a mother and father know their child is going to live to adulthood, they start to naturally reduce their population size,"" says Melinda.:This is a point Gates has made repeatedly, and his views were clearly articulated in the 2009 Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Annual Letter:A surprising but critical fact we learned was that reducing the number of deaths actually reduces population growth ... Contrary to the Malthusian view that population will grow to the limit of however many kids can be fed, in fact parents choose to have enough kids to give them a high chance that several will survive to support them as they grow old. As the number of kids who survive to adulthood goes up, parents can achieve this goal without having as many children.In other words, Gates is not interested in using vaccines to reduce the population by using them as an agent of death or a tool to sterilize unsuspecting masses. Rather, Gates is interested in keeping more children alive in order to reduce the need for parents to have more children, thus limiting the overall population growth rate.As evidenced in a 2014 paper published in Science that attempted to calculate future population growth, not everyone is convinced childhood mortality is the smoking gun to quell population growth::Among the most robust empirical findings in the literature on fertility transitions are that higher contraceptive use and higher female education are associated with faster fertility decline. These suggest that the projected rapid population growth could be moderated by greater investments in family planning programs to satisfy the unmet need for contraception and in girls' education.But Gates' view on childhood mortality contribution to population growth is increasingly discussed in the scientific literature and is still subject to debate. What is not up to debate are the intentions of the Bill and Melinda Gate's Foundation with regard to vaccines and population growth, as articulated by Bill and Melinda Gates in their Foundation's 2017 Annual Letter:Melinda: Saving children's lives is the goal that launched our global work. It's an end in itself. But then we learned it has all these other benefits as well. If parents believe their children will survive -- and if they have the power to time and space their pregnancies -- they choose to have fewer children.Bill: When a mother can choose how many children to have, her children are healthier, they're better nourished, their mental capacities are higher -- and parents have more time and money to spend on each child's health and schooling. That's how families and countries get out of poverty. This link between saving lives, a lower birthrate, and ending poverty was the most important early lesson Melinda and I learned about global health.:This is obviously a far cry from, as Your News Wire.com put it, having Bill Gates tell us ""how we must all consent to a 'kill the humans' strategy, to 'save the planet' from the carbon dioxide we make."""

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.Americans who seek political insight and information on Twitter should know how much of what they are seeing is the result of automated propaganda campaigns.Nearly four years after my collaborators and I revealed how automated Twitter accounts were distorting online election discussions in 2016, the situation appears to be no better. That's despite the efforts of policymakers, technology companies and even the public to root out disinformation campaigns on social media.In our latest study, we collected 240 million election-related tweets mentioning presidential candidates and election-related keywords, posted between June 20 and Sept. 9, 2020. We looked for activity from automated (or bot) accounts, and the spread of distorted or conspiracy theory narratives. :We learned that on Twitter, many conspiracy theories, including QAnon, may not be quite as popular among real people as media reports indicate. But automation can significantly increase the distribution of these ideas, inflating their power by reaching unsuspecting users who may be drawn in not by posts from their fellow humans, but from bots programmed to spread the word. Bots amplify conspiracy theoriesTypically, bots are created by people or groups who want to amplify certain ideas or points of view. We found that bots are roughly equally active in online discussions of both right-wing and left-wing perspectives, making up about 5% of the Twitter accounts active in those threads. Bots appear to thrive in political groups discussing conspiracy theories, making up nearly 13% of the accounts tweeting or retweeting posts with conspiracy theory-related hashtags and keywords.:Then we looked more closely at three major categories of conspiracies. One was a category of alleged scandals described using the suffix ""-gate,"" such as ""Pizzagate"" and ""Obamagate."" The second was COVID-19-related political conspiracies, such as biased claims that the virus was deliberately spread by China or that it could be spread via products imported from China. The third was the QAnon movement, which has been called a ""collective delusion"" and a ""virtual cult.""These three categories overlap: Accounts tweeting about material in one of them were likely to also tweet about material in at least one of the others.The link to right-wing mediaWe found that the accounts that are prone to share conspiratorial narratives are significantly more likely than nonconspirator accounts to tweet links to, or retweet posts from, right-leaning media such as One America News Network, Infowars and Breitbart.:Bots play an important role as well: More than 20% of the accounts sharing content from those hyperpartisan platforms are bots. And most of those accounts also distribute conspiracy-related content.Twitter has recently tried to limit the spread of QAnon and other conspiracy theories on its site. But that may not be enough to stem the tide.

462,462,31.HowConspiracyTheorie,"This article is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.Debate has grown in recent years over the role that social media algorithms play in spreading conspiracy theories and extreme political content online. YouTube's recommender algorithm has come under particularly severe scrutiny. A number of exposes have detailed how it can take viewers down a radicalisation rabbit hole.While YouTube has certainly extended the reach of conspiracy theorists, it's difficult to assess the objective role of algorithms in these radicalisation processes. But my own research has observed the way certain radical communities which congregate at the fringes of the web have managed to essentially manufacture conspiracy theories. These have, in turn, trended on social media.In 2019, YouTube dramatically cleaned up its platform after coming under pressure from journalists. It removed lucrative ad revenue and deleted entire channels - most notoriously the Infowars channel of the US talk-radio host Alex Jones.:While a recent research paper on this topic noted a corresponding overall decrease in conspiracy theory videos on YouTube, it also observed that the platform continued to recommend conspiratorial videos to viewers who had previously consumed such material. The findings indicate that plenty of potentially objectionable content remains on YouTube. However, they don't necessarily support the argument that viewers are guided by algorithms down rabbit holes of ever-more conspiratorial content.By contrast, another recent study of YouTube's recommender algorithm found that conspiracy channels seemed to gain ""zero traffic from recommendations"". While this particular study's methodology generated some debate back and forth, the fact is that an accurate understanding of how these social media algorithms work is impossible. Their inner workings are a corporate secret known only to a few - and possibly even to no humans at all because the underlying mechanisms are so complex.Not just cultural dopes:The presumption that audiences are the passive recipients of media messages - that they are ""cultural dopes"" easily subject to subliminal manipulation - has a long popular history in the field of media and communications studies. It's an argument that's often popped up in conservative reactions to heavy metal music and video game violence.But by focusing on audiences as active participants rather than passive recipients we arguably gain greater insights into the complex media ecosystem within which conspiracy theories develop and propagate online. Often these move from the subcultural fringes of the deep web to a more mainstream audience.Conspiracy theories are an increasingly important method of indoctrination and extremist radicalisation. At the same time, their adversarial logic also maps onto a populist style of political rhetoric that pits the general will of the people against a corrupt and ageing establishment elite.A much more extreme version of this dynamic is also characteristic of right-wing anger against the perceived dominance of a ""globalist liberal elite"". Such anger galvanised parts of the trolling subculture associated with certain forums, message boards and microblogging social networks, in support of the presidential candidacy of Donald Trump.:A common rhetorical technique used on the far-right political discussion forum of the anonymous message board 4chan has been to lump together all manifestations of this liberal, globalist elite into a singular nebulous ""other"". Whether a perfidious individual, a shadowy organisation, or a suspect way of thinking, this conspiracy is imagined as something which undermines the interests of the ultra-nationalist community. These interests also tend to coincide with those of Trump as well as of the white race in general.This far-right online community has an established record of propagating hatred, and it has also produced two extremely bizarre and extremely successful pro-Trump conspiracy theories: Pizzagate and QAnon.PizzagateUnlike the black boxes of corporate social media algorithms, 4chan datasets are easily captured and analysed, which has allowed us to study these conspiracy theories in order to identify the processes that brought them about. In both cases these conspiracy theories can be understood as the product of collective labour by amateur researchers congregating within these fringe communities who build up a theory by a process of referencing and citation.:Pizzagate was a bizarre theory connecting the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton to a child sex ring supposedly run out of a pizza parlour in Washington DC. It developed on 4chan in the course of a single day, shortly before the November 2016 US election. What made Pizzagate new and unusual was how it seemed to emerge from the fringes of the web, at a safe distance from Trump's own campaign.Algorithms surely did play a part in spreading #Pizzagate. But more crucial to legitimising it was the way elements of the story filtered through popular social media channels on Twitter and YouTube, including the Infowars channel of Alex JonesQAnonA year later, at the outset of the investigation by Robert Mueller into alleged Russian collusion in the Trump campaign, a new conspiracy theory once again emerged from 4chan. It reworked some elements of the Pizzagate narrative and combined it together with ""deep state"" conspiracy theories. What would in time simply become known as QAnon initially grew from a series of 4chan posts by a supposed government official with ""Q level"" security clearance.:Citation network that started the QAnon conspiracy theory on 4chan/pol/Andrea Beneddti, Author providedOften referred to by readers as ""breadcrumbs"", these posts tended to simply ask open ended questions - such as ""who controls the narrative?"" ""what is a map?"" and ""why is this relevant?"". Like medieval scholars engaged in interpretation of metaphysical texts, readers have constructed elaborate illuminated manuscripts and narrative compilations. One of these is currently an Amazon #1 bestseller in the category of ""censorship"".:The message here is that by focusing on the role of algorithms in amplifying the reach of conspiracy theories, we should be careful not to fall back on a patronising framework that imagines people as passive relays rather than active audiences engaged in their own kind of research which propagates radically alternative interpretations of events.The theory that social media algorithms lure people into conspiracy theories is difficult to definitively prove. But what's clear is that a conspiratorial subculture with roots extending into the deep web now increasingly appears just below the surface of average people's seemingly ""normal"" media consumption. In the end, the real problem is less one of manipulation by algorithms than of political polarisation.:Marc Tuters, Department of Media & Culture, Faculty of Humanities, University of AmsterdamThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

463,463,484.IsThisBarackObamasKe,"Claim:A Certified Registration of Birth issued in Kenya documents that Barack Obama was born in that country.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 2 August 2009, realtor/dentist/lawyer Dr. Orly Taitz Esq. unveiled her latest piece of dubious evidence in her long-running quest to demonstrate that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States of America:  A photograph of a  document purporting to be a Certified Copy of Registration of Birth issued by the Republic of Kenya in February 1964 which recorded a ""Barack Hussein II"" as having been born to Barack Hussein Obama and Stanley Ann (Dunham) Obama in Mombasa, Kenya, in August 1961.  Said document was reportedly obtained by Dr. Taitz from ""an anonymous source"" who didn't want his name disclosed because he was ""afraid for his life"": : Skeptics quickly identified a variety of reasons for questioning the legitimacy of the supposed Kenyan document, such as: The document is dated 17 February 1964 and a bears a legend identifying it as having been issued by the ""Republic of Kenya,"" but Kenya (a former British colony) didn't officially adopt that name until 12 December 1964.  In February 1964, it was known as the Dominion of Kenya. The listed age of Barack Obama's father is incorrect.  (Barack Obama Sr. was born in 1936 and therefore would have been 24 or 25 years old at the time of Barack Jr.'s birth, not 26 as shown on the document.) Mombasa is very far (several hundred miles) away from the part of Kenya in which Barack Obama Sr.'s family lived. Even if Barack Obama's parents and family had wanted to travel away from their home so his birth could take place at hospital facilities within a large city, they would likely have set out for the much closer city of Nairobi.Within a few days the certificate was clearly revealed to be a fake -- it was actually a forgery based on a copy of an Australian Registration of Birth issued to one David Jeffrey Bomford (who was born in South Australia in 1959) which was grabbed off the Internet and used as a template for creating the fake Kenyan certificate:: (Note the many features shared by these documents: Same certificate number, same book number, same page number, and the remarkable similarities in names -- the Registrar listed on the Australian document is G.F. Lavender, while on the Kenyan document, it's E.F. Lavender; the District Registrar listed on the Australian document is J.H. Miller, while on the Kenyan document it's M.H. Miller.)  When reporters tracked down David Bomford, who currently lives in Adelaide, South Australia, for comment, he was somewhat bemused at having become the focus of an international news story:Bomford said it was hard to believe ""a grey-haired old guy sitting in a corner in quiet old Adelaide"" had been swept up in a push to unseat the most powerful man in the world.""It is interesting someone from here being involved in a conspiracy -- that is so funny,"" he told public broadcaster ABC.Bomford said he knew nothing about the ""birthers'"" claims.He said the fake Kenyan birth certificate contained his personal details and was clearly based on his own South Australian document.""It's definitely a copy of my certificate. It's so laughable it's ridiculous,"" he said.Bomford said he only expected relatives researching their family tree would be interested in the document when it was posted on the Internet.:Dr. Taitz declined to throw in the towel and admit she was duped by a forgery, however, instead claiming that the ""Bomford [birth certificate] was created to try to discredit my efforts"" and  suggesting that hoaxsters had created an identical  (phony) Kenyan Registration of Birth in order to discredit her genuine (phony) Kenyan Registration of Birth.Another Barack Obama ""Kenyan birth certificate"" of dubious origin was offered for sale by one Lucas Smith via eBay in August 2009: This document exhibited many of the same red flags as the previous forgery, including its identification of the location of Barack Obama Jr.'s birth as Mombasa, even though that city was very far away from the part of Kenya in which Barack Obama Sr.'s family lived:The image is part of the extremely ill-informed conspiracy theory that Obama was born in Mombasa -- conveniently, one of the more Muslim parts of the country.This has always been a red flag for conspiracy theorists, so it deserves some explanation. Barack Obama Sr. was born and educated in Nyanza Province, in southwestern Kenya, on Lake Victoria. This is the area where Obama's family lived and continues to live; Sarah Obama, the step-grandmother of the president, lives in Nyang'oma Kogelo, a small town in the province. But Mombasa is a city on the Indian Ocean, a thousand miles to the east. It didn't even have an international airport until 1979.:In September 2009, Orly Taitz attempted to introduce the second ""Kenyan birth certificate""  in the case of Rhodes v. MacDonald as evidence that Barack Obama was born outside the United States U.S. District Court Judge Clay Land dismissed the complaint and threatened to sanction Ms. Taitz if she filed any similarly frivolous motions in the future:Plaintiff has demonstrated no likelihood of success on the merits. Her claims are based on sheer conjecture and speculation. She alleges no factual basis for her ""hunch"" or ""feeling"" or subjective belief that the President was not born in the United States ... Unlike in Alice in Wonderland, simply saying something is so does not make it so.Plaintiff's counsel, who champions herself as a defender of liberty and freedom, seeks to use the power of the judiciary to compel a citizen, albeit the President of the United States, to ""prove his innocence"" to ""charges"" that are based [solely] upon conjecture and speculation. Any middle school civics student would readily recognize the irony of abandoning [the] fundamental principles upon which our country was founded in order to purportedly ""protect and preserve"" those very principles.Plaintiff's counsel is hereby notified that the filing of any future actions in this Court, which are similarly frivolous, shall subject counsel to sanctions.:A spoof web site, the Republic of Kenya Birth Certificate Generator, allows Internet users to create their very own fake Certified Registration of Birth documents from Kenya."
464,464,250.DoesanImageShowOcasi,"Claim:A ""newly uncovered"" photograph reveals Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was crying over an empty parking lot, not detained migrant children, at a protest in Texas.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On the one-year anniversary of a large protest against the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy that separated migrant children from their parents, photojournalist Ivan Pierre Aguirre posted photographs he took during the June 24, 2018, event in Tornillo, Texas.:One picture captured then-U.S. House of Representatives candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez having an emotional reaction while looking through a fence toward a detention facility housing children. Conspiracy trolls latched on to that image, claiming without evidence that the series of photographs from which is was taken were staged:Before @AOC hit the national stage & was just a fairly unknown House candidate frm NYC,she took time awy frm her campaign & came dwn to #Tornillo to protest the #tentcity housing migrant children.I made these previously unpublished fotos a yr ago today. #elpaso #aoc #onassignment pic.twitter.com/SWyyI1XVt9-- Ivan Pierre Aguirre (@i_p_a_1) June 25, 2019Given that the detention of immigrant children has become a major point of national controversy, and that the obsession with Ocasio-Cortez among right-leaning media outlets has been fairly constant since her surprise election to represent New York's 14th district in 2018, it's perhaps no surprise that dissecting the pictures for signs of alleged malfeasance became a new internet pastime.:""The pictures were ridiculed particularly as there was no sight of actual migrant children during the protest,"" Fox News reported.That's no surprise, Aguirre told us. The roadway leading to the encampment was closed off to news media and protesters. ""Obviously,"" he said, ""there weren't kids two feet away.""Fox News also quoted a social media user voicing another critique, writing: ""Excuse me while I take the time to put on bright red lipstick, a pristine white outfit and a Movado watch before I go see little kids locked up in the desert.""Aguirre said the group Ocasio-Cortez accompanied to Tornillo wore white as part of their protest. The rest of the criticism, he averred, seemed much ado about nothing. ""You can't wear lipstick and be at a protest?"" Aguirre said. ""Her watch -- OK she has a new watch. People are just criticizing everything.""But the claim that got the most attention, pushed by viral conspiracy and junk news websites, made unfounded accusations that the photographs of Ocasio-Cortez were fake and that she was actually crying over an empty parking lot. Russian state media outlet RT and ZeroHedge were among junk news sites taking a cue from Alex Jones' InfoWars network in that regard. The latter posted an unfounded story on June 24, 2019, that posited the ""empty parking lot"" conspiracy theory.:""The photos show an emotional AOC holding her face and appearing to cry. Her attention appears to be directed towards whatever is on the other side of the fence,"" InfoWars reported. ""However, a photo from a different angle shows there is nothing there aside from an empty parking lot and some police officers.""The conspiracy theory was a low-effort jab that required viewers not ask what lay just beyond the camera lens or seek out additional, readily available information about the event. Police weren't guarding an empty parking lot, and the photographs weren't newly uncovered.The photographs touted by InfoWars were in fact those shot by Aguirre, who posted them on his Twitter account one year prior to InfoWars' ""newly uncovering"" them.The so-called empty parking lot was in fact a roadway leading towards the Tornillo Border Patrol station, where thousands of migrant children were housed in a tent city.:""It wasn't an empty parking lot; it's an entrance and we [media and protesters] weren't allowed to go past that,"" Aguirre told us.He sent us another photograph in which the roadway and the fence blocking access to the migrant camp could be seen: Courtesy: Ivan Pierre Aguirre:Ocasio-Cortez wasn't the first or last person to get emotional after reaching that fence. ""She finally got to the fence and right beyond that road, way to the left, was the [migrant tent city] camp, and it represented something that made her emotional,"" Aguirre told us. ""I've been out there, and some people get mad, some people cry, some people pray. No one questioned her [when the photographs were posted] last year.""Aguirre pointed out that during the 2018 protest he was on assignment for the Texas Tribune, and he -- like most Americans at the time -- didn't know who Ocasio-Cortez was.""It was just a genuine, found moment,"" he said. ""If we [the news media] weren't there she still would have broken down, I think. She could see the entrance to the camps out in the distance.""Aguirre, a freelancer whose work has also been published by the New York Times and Associated Press, told us the photographs of Ocasio-Cortez were just a few of many he captured at the protest that day, which some celebrities also attended, including singer Sia, model Amber Heard, and actresses Lena Dunham and Mira Sorvino.:Reporting that real but politically inconvenient events were actually staged is a long-standing practice at InfoWars. Jones was successfully sued for defamation by parents of children who were slain in the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school massacre after Jones led his fans to believe the shooting was staged, and some of them relentlessly tormented those parents, believing them to be acting on behalf of a vague cabal seeking to undermine national sovereignty.Paul Joseph Watson, the InfoWars Twitter personality who helped boost the bogus ""empty parking lot"" story, was also key in pushing unfounded claims in April 2019 that the fire at the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris was intentionally set by Muslims.After our fact check was published, Watson authored a second, equally misleading story claiming Aguirre demanded Watson remove the photographs from his posts because it was revealed Ocasio-Cortez was ""crying over nothing."" In fact, Aguirre sent take-down notices to various publications and social media gadflies for copyright violations."
465,465,655.PinterestRemovesThre,"On 30 October 2017, the social media company Pinterest announced new community guidelines for health misinformation, including a policy which stipulated thatWe remove any content that promotes harmful behavior, or anything that encourages or suggests self-harm. We'll take action on misinformation that has immediate and detrimental effects on a pinner's health or on public safety -- like promotion of false cures for terminal or chronic illnesses and anti-vaccination advice.Anti-vaccine websites such as Health Impact News and Natural News were among the first large-scale accounts hit by the rule change, with the former complaining that Pinterest had succumbed to an ""extremist pro-vaccine position."" Now in late 2018, it appears that many more medical conspiracy bloggers, supplement peddlers, and anti-vaccine websites have been caught up in the company's continued crackdown on dangerous health misinformation. In a 14 December 2018 Facebook post, Erin Elizabeth of Health Nut News announced that both she and her partner Dr. Mercola, two of the more prolific health misinformers on the internet, had seen their accounts removed as well::I have worked many years on building my Pinterest account each and every day to bring information to other people.I began it before I even had my website and it had many thousands of followers. Now poof. It is gone ... in an instant. There are many other pages that have disappeared and I know I am not alone ... My other half of nearly 10 years, Dr. Mercola, was banned last month. The reason? None of us were saying ""vaccines cause autism!"" Or anything like that. We just happen to be a couple of the larger pages worldwide that even question or discuss vaccines at all. For that? All the years of hard work we have are gone in an instant. Guess what? It feels like Nazi Germany is right around the corner. And I'm not even joking.In point of fact, Elizabeth's Health Nut News frequently suggests that vaccines cause autism. In August 2018, for example, she wrote ""check out the video below where [Dr. Suzanne Humphries] discusses the potential connection between vaccines and autism. She says there is an undeniable connection between the two"" in an article titled ""What Causes Autism? This Explanation Might Be the Best We've Heard!"" While Elizabeth frequently peddles misinformed scaremongering about vaccines, her website is probably most well-known for pushing conspiracy theories about an alleged government- or Big Pharma-sponsored killing of holistic health practitioners. Dr. Mercola has also frequently suggested that vaccines cause autism. In a November 2017 article titled ""Vaccines -- Are They Still Contributing to the Greater Good?"", for example, Mercola both suggested that vaccines cause ""vaccine-associated autism"", and that special diets can alleviate said autism::The good news is there is much more information available today about alternative biomedical therapies. These are being used by open-minded doctors addressing the neuroimmune dysfunction that children with vaccine-associated autism are suffering. Some children diagnosed with ""autism"" are improving through use of special diets, supplementation regimens and detoxification protocols tailored to their individual needs.While Mercola's website Mercola.com is one of the largest ""alternative health"" news sources on the internet, it is also an online store that has been fined or warned several times by the FDA and FTC for the promotion of dubious cures. In February 2017, as part of a settlement with the FTC, Mercola was forced to refund ""$2.59 million to more than 1,300 people who bought Mercola indoor tanning systems,"" which he had claimed on his website did not increase the risk of melanoma skin cancer but did reduce the effects of aging.A third significant purveyor of dubious health advice, Sayer Ji's GreenMedInfo, also appears to have been affected by the crackdown. ""On Dec. 13th, 2018 Pinterest removed GreenMedInfo.com, one of the world's most trafficked and widely referenced natural health research sites, from its platform,"" Ji said in a 18 December 2018 post. In that post, Ji made a dubious claim regarding his websites' past treatment of the topic of vaccines::Pinterest's accusations of misinformation (read 'fake news') are curious, to say the least, considering that all of our information on vaccination either reproduces verbatim published, peer-reviewed literature on the topic of their unintended, adverse effects, or simply reports on this primary, presumably rock solid layer of the biomedical literature.In our view, Ji's claim is ""curious"" because -- as just one example -- on 13 September 2018, GreenMedInfo published an article by anti-vaccine activist J. B. Handley titled ""The Clear Legal Basis That Vaccines Cause Autism"" which did not ""reproduce verbatim published, peer-reviewed literature,"" nor did it report on ""the biomedical literature."" Instead, it was a lengthy opinion piece that attempted to make a ""legal"" argument for the link based on conspiracy theories about the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. GreenMedInfo had also published multiple articles by Dan Olmsted, the former editor of Age of Autism, a website that aggressively pushes the notion that vaccines cause autism.We reached out to Pinterest to ask if any particular reason underlaid what appeared to be an increase in the enforcement of their health misinformation guidelines. A spokesperson told us via email that Pinterest ""continue to take action on content and accounts that violate our community guidelines,"" adding that they ""regularly look for and remove content that violates our policies, in addition to removing violating content that's reported to us by users."":""We recognize the important role vaccines play in personal and public health, which is why it is our policy to remove anti-vaccination advice and other health misinformation from our platform,"" Pinterest told us."
466,466,391.DidBannedPhotoExpose,"Claim:A ""banned"" photograph of a man in a suit walking on ""the moon"" revealed the 1969 moon landing was a hoax.Rating:MiscaptionedAbout this rating In December 2020, a TikTok user with a penchant for conspiracy-theory sharebait posted a short video that purportedly contained proof that the 1969 moon landing had been faked -- a new twist on an age-old canard. On Dec. 1, @cursedhome posted a clip that consisted of a black-and-white still photograph of a man in a suit walking on what looked like the moon, along with the labels ""Leaked government photo from the Deep Web exposes the fake moon landing"" and ""This photo is banned!"":: The TikTok account in question is replete with nonsensical content about ""inner earth civilizations,"" alien life, and COVID-19, much of it accompanied by sensationalist labels like ""banned video,"" ""this clip is banned,"" and ""the government doesn't want you to see this banned documentary."" The ""faked moon landing"" video was no different.The photograph in question does not constitute proof that the moon landing was faked, is not banned, and is not owned by the U.S. government. Thus, @cursedhome managed to pack three significant falsehoods into just 16 words.The photograph was taken in September 1969, after the successful Apollo 11 mission to the moon in July that year. It shows the controversial former Nazi aeronautics engineer Wernher von Braun, who was brought to the U.S. after World War II and played a key role in developing the rocket technology used in the Apollo 11 mission. In the photograph, von Braun is walking on a replica model of the moon landing at the Southeastern Fair in Atlanta, Georgia. :The photo was attributed to United Press International (UPI), a leading news agency at that time, and not the U.S. government, and it was republished by several regional newspapers, along with the following caption:""Dr. Wernher von Braun, one of the leaders in America's space flight program, took a walk on the moon as he strolled through an exact replica of the Apollo 11 moon landing after officially opening the exhibition at Atlanta's Southeastern Fair."":Previewing the fair, on Sept. 1, 1969, the Atlanta Constitution reported:A detailed reenactment of man's first walk on the moon, including authentic moon surface with small craters and flat rocks and a replica of the landing module will be a major attraction at this year's Southeastern Fair, opening Sept. 25. A tableau of the actual moon walk will be staged in the administration building of the fair, which has been cleared to make way for concrete, sand and other materials needed to build an authentic moon surface down to the minute details, including the footprints of the astronauts.The next month, the Atlanta Constitution followed up with an article that included a photograph of two local gardening enthusiasts ""planting"" flowers on that same replica moon surface::The photograph is also not ""banned"" or available only on the ""deep web."" It is readily available online, searchable through search engines, and posted to mainstream social networks: :"
467,467,404.DoesWebsiteforWiscon,"Claim:A Republican group in Wisconsin refused to remove an online message urging supporters to ""prepare for war"" despite the U.S. Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021.Rating:TrueAbout this rating On Jan. 12, 2021, news reports surfaced alleging a web page for Wisconsin's St. Croix County Republican Party told supporters to ""prepare for war"" despite urging from the state party to remove the message and the deadly insurrection by supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump at the U.S. Capitol the previous week.::The reports were true. As of this report, the homepage for the local Republican group in northwestern Wisconsin read, ""Si vis pacem, para bellum"" -- the Latin adage, ""if you want peace, prepare for war."" Then, underneath that heading, the page said in English:If you want peace, prepare for war.The phrase, originally coined in the 4th or 5th century, embodies the concept conveyed in earlier works such as Plato's ""Nomoi"", and carries with it a modern day interpretation of ""Peace Through Strength"", a cornerstone of conservative beliefs.Welcome to the digital battlefield.The message also perpetuated the conspiracy theory that ""Democrats in concert with the Marxist left and a complicit mass media"" were running a coordinated scheme to undermine conservative Americans and try to overturn Trump's 2016 presidential win, without providing proof to support the claims.The page also alleged Trump's political opponents colluded in an illegal scheme to block him from serving another presidential term, though numerous court battles and reviews by election security experts proved that did not happen. Rather, President-elect Joe Biden defeated Trump under election laws outlined in the Constitution and federal and state statutes: He received at least 270 electoral votes. (See here for all of our fact-checking content related to 2020 voter fraud claims.):After those false claims, the St. Croix Republican Party's homepage said Trump radically changed the party, and that ""patriots need to continue the fight"" and ""stand and be counted as a conservative warrior"" to uphold the Constitution and remove ""leftist tyrants"" from elected positions in Wisconsin.According to online archives of the URL, stcroixrepubblican.org, the website at one point called for ""eliminating"" those political opponents instead of removing them.The St. Croix County party's chairman, John Kraft, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the homepage included the phrase ""prepare for war"" before the deadly insurrection in defiance of Biden's presidential win on Jan. 6. He did not say when, exactly, the page was first posted, and did not respond to the local newspaper's question about whether he thought about taking down the message after the attack by right-wing extremists.Kraft told the newspaper he ""can't help what twisted inferences local Democrats choose to attribute to it."":On Jan. 9, Kraft said on his Facebook page that ""it's never been clearer that we are absolutely at war with the left,"" according to The Associated Press.A representative of the group did not respond to Snopes' request for an interview for this report, though we will post updates when, or if, someone returns our message.According to Wisconsin Republican Chairman Andrew Hitt, the state party does not control the local parties, and it asked St. Croix County Republicans to remove the call to ""prepare for war"" before the violent insurrection, though he did not specify a date for the request. He told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel:""Especially in light of recent events, it's an ill-chosen phrase to express their sentiments,"" Hitt said. ""We suggested at an earlier date they remove this, but they declined to take our advice."""
468,468,426.HowFacebooksFailures,"On Oct. 4, 2021, several disclosures became public that detailed what Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen said she learned from the company's own internal documents. The documents contain many details that were not broadcast during her ""60 Minutes"" interview the previous day. She has filed those complaints with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.On ""60 Minutes,"" CBS News correspondent Scott Pelley asked: ""When and how did it occur to you to take all of these documents out of the company?"" In response, Haugen said: ""At some point in 2021, I realized, 'Okay, I'm gonna have to do this in a systemic way, and I have to get out enough that no one can question that this is real.'""A key through-line at the heart of the data was this from one of the disclosures: ""Facebook has avoided or rolled back interventions for 'groups' and 'narrow subpopulations' that it knew reduced misinformation, violence, and incitement because those interventions reduced the platform's growth.""We reached out to both Haugen and Facebook's media relations team with questions. However, we did not receive responses to our inquiries.:In reviewing all of the whistleblower disclosures, we have found what appear to be examples in our past reporting that bear out what Haugen was talking about. These connections lend credibility to her assertions about what she said was happening inside CEO Mark Zuckerberg's trillion-dollar company.The Capitol RiotIn the weeks before the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, we repeatedly reached out to specific Facebook media relations employees with urgent emails that warned of violent rhetoric inside a private group. The Texas-based, private Facebook group was named Alamo City Trump Train. Other groups included New Braunfels Trump Train and San Antonio Trump Train.We joined Alamo City Trump Train around Nov. 1 just before Election Day (Nov. 3). Inside, we discovered that members used Facebook to coordinate real-time movements while harassing a Biden-Harris campaign bus and another vehicle driven by a staffer along Interstate 35 in Texas. The incident happened on Oct. 30 and made headlines across the country. U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted his approval of the violent incident. Biden and Harris were not on the bus.:Several posts in Alamo City Trump Train showed that the Facebook group was used to coordinate real-time movements to harass the Biden-Harris campaign bus in Texas.Inside the group, we found plenty of references to pedophilia as alleged in the QAnon conspiracy theory. One of the posts even showed members recruiting others into QAnon. A group member said of the Biden-Harris campaign bus: ""Mobile bus of scumbag pedophile trash! Traitors to their own country!"" One group member referred to the effort as ""#OperationBlockTheBus"" in a post that received hundreds of likes and positive comments. We showed these and other QAnon-related posts to specific Facebook employees when we emailed them with questions. The company had previously announced that it would ban groups that openly supported QAnon. However, the company did not provide answers, nor did it ban the group at the time.:After our questions went unanswered in subsequent emails, we emailed the company one last time before Jan. 6. Once again, the email was sent to specific Facebook employees who had responded to our correspondence in the past. We showed that group members were posting about taking matters into their own hands. One member commented: ""Stand back and stand by!"" Another person said: ""Be vigilant in defending this country by all means necessary."" He continued with capital letters: ""We can't fold to the EVILNESS THAT THEY CARRY. NO MORE NICE GUY."" Some even spoke of driving long distances over state lines to go where votes were expected to be counted ahead of the certification process in Congress on Jan. 6.Members in the private Alamo City Trump Train Facebook group posted about taking matters into their own hands.:The New York Times later reported that a man named Keith Lee ""spent the morning of Jan. 6 casing the entrances to the Capitol."" During the riots, he carried a bullhorn. ""Mr. Lee called out for the mob to rush in, until his voice echoed from the dome of the Rotunda."" And according to the Times, Lee was involved in organizing the caravan and blockade of the Biden-Harris campaign bus in Texas, thus specifically linking a Capitol riot attendee to the convoy organized inside the Alamo City Trump Train Facebook group. The New York Times reported that in addition to Lee's attendance at the riot, he also helped to fund ""dozens of caravans to meet at the Jan. 6 rally.""The New Braunfels Trump Train and San Antonio Trump Train Facebook groups were also reportedly involved in the caravan. Screenshots showed real-time coordination also took place in at least one of them. Two lawsuits have since been announced by people who were on the bus. One of the lawsuits is against several Trump supporters who were said to have been involved in the incident. According to court documents, they are Eliazar Cisneros, Hannah Ceh, Joeylynn Mesaros, Robert Mesaros, Dolores Park, and ""John and Janes Does."" The second lawsuit is aimed at local law enforcement for what the plaintiffs who were on the bus claimed was a failure to respond.:In a new development, we found data that showed at least seven additional people linked to these three Trump Train groups appeared to be in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6. We made some of these findings inside a new and active private Facebook group that appeared to be created in the weeks following the riot. Four of the people seemed to confirm their presence at the insurrection with their own social media posts. The other three purported Jan. 6 attendees were mentioned in the lawsuit's court documents:Following the October 30, 2020 [bus] incident, members of the New Braunfels Trump Train--including Jason Frank--were identified in media reports and on social media as having taken part in the January 6, 2021 insurrection. Steve Ceh and Randi Ceh were also in Washington, D.C. that day. On January 7, YouTube user New Braunfels Trump Train posted a video entitled ""January 6, 2021 will go down a day in history[U.S. flag emoji][U.S. flag emoji]."" The video features a photo of Steve and Randi Ceh apparently posing in front of the Capitol steps as others are breaching or attempting to breach the building.This brought the number of Capitol riot attendees from these Facebook groups that were involved in the Biden-Harris bus incident to a total of at least eight people.:On March 30, we published another report after we discovered that the Alamo City Trump Train Facebook group was still active. Within hours of that story going up, Facebook removed the group from its platform. It's unclear what happened to the Facebook groups for New Braunfels Trump Train and San Antonio Trump Train, as they appeared to either be hidden or removed by the platform.Despite the violent nature of these events, Facebook has never responded to our questions, nor did the company appear to take action on the group prior to Jan. 6. On Aug. 17, we asked the company about our warnings ahead of the Capitol riot. We posed questions in an email thread in which the company was already replying to other topics. Facebook stopped responding in the thread after we brought up the Jan. 6 matter.On Oct. 4, the morning after Haugen's ""60 Minutes"" interview was broadcast, CNBC interviewed Antigone Davis, Facebook's global head of safety. In the following video, Davis said she was ""not particularly familiar"" with our findings. (The moment begins at the 2:47 mark.):On Oct. 8, we inquired yet again with Facebook's media relations team by email. The company did not respond.Why didn't Facebook take action on the Alamo City Trump Train group prior to Jan. 6, especially in the weeks following the bus incident? One of Haugen's whistleblower disclosures provided insight into the way the company dealt with such matters: ""Facebook's [internal] records confirm that Facebook knowingly chose to permit political misinformation and violent content/groups and failed to adopt or continue measures to combat these issues, including as related to the 2020 U.S. election and the January 6th insurrection, in order to promote virality and growth on its platforms."":Another data point in the disclosure contains a line from those very same internal company records. The following sentence was mentioned in reference to Facebook waiting until late 2020 to take action on the QAnon conspiracy theory presence on its own platform, thereby purportedly helping it to blossom: ""We were willing to act only *after* things had spiraled into a dire state."" Yet another internal record stated: ""Through most of 2020, we saw non-violating content promoting QAnon spreading through our platforms. Belief in the QAnon conspiracy theory took hold in multiple communities, and we saw multiple cases in which such belief motivated people to kill or conspire to kill perceived enemies.""In fact, according to more of the company's own internal research that Haugen said she copied while working there, Facebook not only served as a place for QAnon believers to meet and recruit but its algorithms also acted as somewhat of a recruitment tool. That's because the act of ""liking"" official, verified political pages could lead users into automatically being recommended certain QAnon content and other conspiracy theories. (Bolded portions of this data were bolded in the whistleblower disclosure.):After a small number of high quality/verified conservative interest follows (Fox News, Donald Trump, Melania Trump - all official pages), within just one day Page recommendations had already devolved towards polarizing content.Although the account set out to follow conservative political news and humor content generally, and began by following verified/high quality conservative pages, Page recommendations began to include conspiracy recommendations after only 2 days (it took < 1 week to get a QAnon recommendation!)Group recommendations were slightly slower to follow suit - it took 1 week for in-feed GYSJ recommendations to become fully political/right-leaning, and just over 1 week to begin receiving conspiracy recommendations.Data attributed to Haugen said: ""Only after and in response to the Capitol protest and public pressure did Facebook take certain steps to the above items on a temporary basis.""One of those steps was to ""reduce the strength"" of Facebook Live videos, in terms of the speed to which they might be able to virally spread. One of the people who live-streamed on Facebook from Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6 was Tina Forte, a Republican who is running in 2022 to claim the seat currently held by U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In one live video recorded from outside the Capitol before the riot began, she encouraged rally attendees at former President Donald Trump's speech to ""get your asses to the Capitol."":In a recent investigation, we reported that she also heavily promoted the Jan. 6 date to what appeared to be at least tens of thousands of people. In her livestream, she posed with other Trump supporters who asked for pictures with her in front of the Capitol. She was somewhat of a celebrity to those who gathered there. Earlier in 2020, she also posed for photographs with the white supremacist Proud Boys leader several times and posted QAnon rhetoric and election fraud conspiracy theories such as ""Stop The Steal."" Forte provided a statement to us that said she did not go to Trump's speech on Jan. 6, nor did she enter the Capitol. She also called what happened on Jan. 6 ""disgusting,"" despite her social media posts that appeared to show her reacting a different way to the outcome of the riot.As of October 2021, Forte was still active on Facebook with one personal profile and two pages. In an email, we previously asked Facebook if it made exceptions to policy enforcement for prominent figures. The company told us that all users, even those running for office, are subject to the company's Community Standards policies.:However, Haugen's whistleblower disclosures mention a ""whitelist"" policy, referred to as the company's ""XCheck"" program. According to Facebook's internal records in the disclosure, the company ""routinely makes exceptions for powerful actors when enforcing content policy."" Another internal company document states: ""Facebook's decision-making on content policy is routinely influenced by political considerations ... Communications and Public Policy teams ... often block changes when they see that they could harm powerful political actors.""As of October 2021, Forte's presence on the platform totalled more than 100,000 followers.An internal record copied by Haugen included a quote from an unknown Facebook employee that came just after Jan. 6: ""We've been fueling this fire for a long time and we shouldn't be surprised it's now out of control.""Foreign Recruitment of a Kentucky Woman:In 2017, a Facebook user named Kristina Cruz created a private group named Sarah Huckabee Sanders Supporters. By 2018, it had tens of thousands of members and added three additional administrators. However, all four admin accounts appeared to be fake, meaning they used photographs of other people to pretend to be Americans. At the same time, most of the members appeared to be real Americans, though the admins had hints of North Macedonian roots.In our investigation, we found that an unwitting woman in Kentucky named Diane was recruited to be a moderator for the group. (Her last name has been omitted from our reporting for privacy purposes.)On Oct. 1, 2020, we contacted Facebook about the group, explaining its apparent foreign origins and the fact that it recruited an unwitting American woman to run its operation. It took Facebook nearly a week to get back to us with answers. We now may know why there was such a long delay in receiving a response. According to The Wall Street Journal's reporting on Haugen's findings, she said that the company's Civic Integrity team was ""understaffed,"" perhaps making it difficult to take swift action on even a small percentage of policy-violating content.:Despite the overwhelming evidence, a Facebook spokesperson eventually told us in an email that the action the company decided to take would be to reduce the group's distribution, meaning it would be harder for Facebook users to stumble upon it. We emailed the company again to ask once more about the unwitting woman in Kentucky, in case the company did not read that part of our message. We did not hear back.Days later, we noticed that the group was no longer accessible. It was either removed or hidden. Private groups can be hidden from view and become invite-only if the option is chosen by an admin. If this group was hidden and remained active, tens of thousands of American members were perhaps still inside and consuming misinformation.Just like the Alamo City Trump Train Facebook group, the Sarah Huckabee Sanders Supporters group appeared to fall under the same explanation from Haugen's whistleblower disclosure, with the company apparently not wanting to take swift action ""in order to promote virality and growth on its platforms."":Further, Haugen said in the disclosures: ""To avoid criticism resulting from inevitable false positives when removing harmful content, Facebook chooses to 'demote' it instead, which it knows to be an ineffective response."" This lined up with Facebook's initial answer to simply demote the Sarah Huckabee Sanders Supporters group by reducing its distribution.It's unclear exactly how Facebook's numeric demotion works. However, the action appears to reduce the number of impressions in conjunction with a group's visibility on devices. Facebook's own internal documentation that was included in one of Haugen's disclosures said that some content might not even be impacted if a Facebook employee took action and demoted a group more than 90 percent. In other words, reducing the potential reach of a group could potentially be ineffective.The Failures of User ReportsOn Oct. 11, 2019, we investigated a foreign, pro-Trump disinformation network of pages, groups, and accounts named ""The BL,"" which stood for ""The Beauty of Life."" It had 55 million total followers and accounts associated with the network and spent more than $9.5 million on Facebook ads. Our investigation, along with Sarah Thompson's reporting for Lead Stories, led to perhaps one of the largest takedowns in the history of Facebook. But it took multiple reports before it came tumbling down. ""The BL"" is closely linked to The Epoch Times, a far-right organization that was banned from advertising on Facebook in August 2019. The news was first reported by NBC News reporters Brandy Zadrozny and Ben Collins.:Some readers may not be familiar with ""The BL."" According to Facebook, the company waited months until the Friday afternoon before Christmas that year to announce that it had been removed. By the time the holiday season wrapped up, it was out of the news cycle.Part of the investigation into ""The BL"" looked at hundreds, if not thousands, of fake accounts. These fake accounts helped to populate and manage the many pages and groups that were created for ""The BL.""Users may be familiar with the act of reporting a policy-violating post and then receiving a message that claims the post did not violate Community Standards.:Over more than two months, we manually reported hundreds of fake accounts several times each using Facebook's report function that is open to all users. This meant that we submitted a total of thousands of manual reports, one-by-one. More than 95 percent of the time, Facebook's support team responded and said that the accounts were not fake, even though they all were. The failure rate for Facebook's manual report system was likely higher than 95 percent. Eventually, Facebook acknowledged they were all fake and removed them at the same time that the entire network was brought down on Dec. 20, 2019.Internal documents from Facebook that were obtained by Haugen said that, in general, it was ""impossible for human reviewers to keep up with"" the ""volume of decisions"" for ""content-level enforcement."" The company's solution was apparently to ""apply classifiers to make content-level decisions at scale.""The same disclosure detailed a document from September 2019, the month before we began investigating ""The BL."" It described ""levers"" that teams could use to change how various parts of Facebook permit certain actions. There were mentions of the possibility of ""reviewing fewer user reports"" and ignoring ""benign"" user reports, which might have been why our user reports failed so often.:Anti-Mask Group Subverts Policies, Facebook ShrugsIn September, we reported that Facebook was knowingly allowing the promotion of a website that sells extra-small-sized ""fake masks."" These products were purchased by anti-mask parents for their children to wear in school to appear as though they complied with COVID-19 guidelines. Such masks might appear to others to look effective. However, the website associated with the company that sold the masks said: ""These masks do nothing at all.""This promotional activity on Facebook is still allowed today by accounts, pages, and groups, despite the fact that the American Academy of Pediatrics published that 173,469 child COVID-19 cases were reported in the U.S. between Sept. 23 and 30.One of the groups that we reported on was Moms Against Masks. While inside the private group, we witnessed an admin post on Sept. 4: ""Facebook has put a restriction on this page until October 2nd requiring Admin approval for posts. It is noted that future violations may shutdown the page."" In the remainder of the same post, the administrator advised members to consider using ""code words or abbreviations such as M for *ask or C for *ovid or V for *accinated to avoid Facebook algorithms."":An admin post from the Moms Against Masks Facebook group.Haugen's whistleblower disclosures describe that some of ""levers"" were purportedly turned off after Election Day in 2020 when the company thought they were no longer needed. She also showed in the documentation that they were turned back on after the violent nature of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Haugen wrote: ""They reverted back to these safer defaults only after the insurrection flared up."" According to the disclosure, this ""roll back"" was a ""temporary"" measure.:One of those ""levers"" referred to ""requiring admins [to] review and approve posts in civic groups that accumulate four strikes."" The admin in Moms Against Masks mentioned that a similar action had been taken on its group after an unknown number of strikes. Whether the lever was on or off, this admin advised group members to get around the penalty by using ""code words.""As of mid-October, more than one month after the admin made this post, the group was still active, even after we emailed Facebook's press team and published our findings for the company to see.After the release of Haugen's whistleblower disclosures, Facebook employees tweeted a statement that spent the first half of the message calling into question Haugen's personal credibility.In sum, the evidence we presented in this report from our past investigations is laid out in combination with Facebook's own internal documents and research that Haugen says she copied before leaving the company. We never received answers from Facebook on the matter involving the Trump Train groups and the Capitol riot. The platform initially chose only to demote a foreign, pro-Trump group, even after learning that an unwitting Kentucky woman had been recruited to moderate its content for around two years. Thousands of tests conducted by Snopes reporters showed that its user report systems failed the vast majority of the time. And an anti-mask group lives on, despite the fact that Facebook knows it's pushing fake masks for children and attempting to subvert detection of policy-breaking content.Note: Our reporting on the Jan. 6 Capitol riot has been passed along to the offices of each member of the select committee that is investigating the violent insurrection."

Rating:FalseAbout this rating ContextThe singer's manager shared on his verified social media account that she was suffering from a bacterial infection. Such an infection has nothing to do with getting vaccinated for COVID-19, though one can get a bacterial infection after contracting the COVID-19 disease.:In June 2023, pop singer Madonna was hospitalized for several days, leading to a flurry of unsubstantiated rumors about her condition. Many Twitter users claimed the hospitalization was connected to her getting a COVID vaccination.@DiedSuddenly_ claimed, ""Madonna has been rushed to a New York City hospital after being found unresponsive"" and connected it to her donation of ""$1.1 Million dollars to Covid Vaccine"" research, and made claims that the vaccine should be 'mandatory like gun control' because it 'saves lives.'""BREAKING: Madonna has been rushed to a New York City hospital after being found unresponsive.The pop icon, 64, was discovered at a residence on Saturday before being admitted to the ICU where she was intubated overnight.Madonna donated $1.1 Million dollars to Covid Vaccine... pic.twitter.com/xL9qGd7aw4-- DiedSuddenly (@DiedSuddenly_) June 28, 2023:@dom_lucre wrote, ""Please pray for Madonna while she recovers in the ICU room after being found unresponsive for what some reports are saying appears to be vaccine related which would be unfortunate if true since Madonna was one of the loudest supporters of the COVID-19 vaccine.""Please pray for Madonna while she recovers in the ICU room after being found unresponsive for what some reports are saying appears to be vaccine related which would be unfortunate if true since Madonna was one of the loudest supporters of the COVID-19 vaccine. pic.twitter.com/C98ijQxYbq-- Dom Lucre | Breaker of Narratives (@dom_lucre) June 28, 2023These claims are false and a deliberate attempt to connect Madonna's illness to the vaccine. According to an Instagram post from the verified account of her manager, Guy Oseary, she was suffering from a bacterial infection. :The post stated: ""On Saturday, June 24, Madonna developed a serious bacterial infection which led to a several day stay in the ICU. Her health is improving, however she is still under medical care. A full recovery is expected."" There was no other publicly available information about her health condition. COVID-19, or the coronavirus disease, is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is not bacterial. Bacteria are single-celled microorganisms that can cause infections, and can live in many types of environments, including in the human body. Viruses are made up of bits of genetic information, either RNA or DNA, surrounded by protein, and need a living host like a person, animal, or plant to survive. :Madonna may have publicly supported COVID-relief efforts through donating $1 million, supported vaccine research, and spoken about mandatory vaccinations, but no evidence exists that any of these actions are connected to her current illness. Bacterial infections are not listed among the adverse effects from getting the COVID vaccine that the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) has investigated. However, bacterial coinfection can occur after contracting COVID itself, according to a 2023 study. Among 36,490 hospitalized adults with COVID-19, 6% had bacterial coinfections. Research led by the University of Alabama at Birmingham found that bacterial coinfection with COVID-19 is a major risk factor for death, intensive care unit admission, and the need for mechanical ventilation.Madonna has also, however, spread unsubstantiated claims about COVID vaccines. In 2020, she claimed in an Instagram video that a vaccine existed but was being concealed. The video was flagged for misinformation by Instagram and later deleted. :This is not the first time a celebrity's health crisis has been falsely connected to the COVID-19 vaccine. An unsubstantiated rumor claimed Jamie Foxx had been left ""paralyzed and blind"" by a COVID-19 vaccine, a claim his team swiftly rejected. Tweets also claimed that actor Lisa Loring died due to the COVID-19 vaccine, without much evidence to back it up. The account @DiedSuddenly_ tweeted about Loring's death, as well as Madonna's health. The account's name references the widely debunked ""died suddenly"" conspiracy theory, which we've reported on previously. The two words ""died suddenly"" became a way to push rumors that posit, without much evidence, that COVID-19 vaccines increased incidences of people suddenly dying, with little to no warning.Given that Madonna's team has confirmed she has a bacterial infection and that bacterial infections are not considered a result of her getting a COVID-19 vaccination -- though such infections are possible after contracting the virus itself -- we rate this claim as False.:  "
470,470,99.DidAntifaJakeAngeliC,"Claim:Michiel Vos colluded with Jake Angeli, a leftist agent provocateur posing as a Trump supporter, as shown in a photograph of the two men.Rating:Mostly FalseAbout this rating What's TrueVos and Angeli were photographed standing next to each other during the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riots. Vos is married to Pelosi's daughter Alexandra.What's FalseVos was present in his capacity as a journalist for Dutch news network RTL 4. He was doing his job when he encountered Angeli, not commemorating a secret plot involving House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Moreover, Angeli is no ""left-wing agent provocateur"" or member of antifa, having long been associated with the pro-Trump QAnon movement.:In the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot in the U.S. Capitol, conspiracy theorists and supporters of outgoing President Donald Trump rushed to claim that the mob who forcibly entered Congressional offices and the chamber of the U.S. Senate had been infiltrated by ""antifa,"" anti-fascist agitators seeking to discredit the movement to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's election victory. Snopes has debunked several strands of that conspiracy theory, including false claims that facial recognition technology had been used to positively identify some individuals seen at the Capitol on Jan. 6 as known antifa instigators.In particular, conspiracy theorists claimed that Jake Angeli, an Arizona resident who appeared in many photographs and videos of the riots, shirtless and wearing horns and furs, was in fact a ""leftist"" agent provocateur who had taken part in a Black Lives Matter march months earlier. Those claims were grossly misleading, as we have outlined, and Angeli is in fact a long-standing and enthusiastic supporter of Trump, and a proponent of the ""QAnon"" cluster of conspiracy theories. :A separate but related claim involved the Dutch-American journalist Michiel Vos, who is married to Alexandra Pelosi, a documentary filmmaker and daughter of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. On social media, users shared what appeared to be a photograph of Vos standing next to Angeli. One tweet read:""What do we have here? Viking guy [Angeli] photographed this morning with Voss [sic], married to Pelosi's daughter Alexandria [sic]."" On Facebook, one user wrote:""HEY AMERICA!! I wonder why Michiel VOS, Nancy Pelosi's son in law was in front of the Capital Building taking SELFIES with 'VIKING MAN' fake Trump supporter Since they have nothing in common .. wink wink.""On Parler, another conspiracy theorist shared the same photograph of Vos and Angeli, adding: ""I'm sure this is all just a coincidence.""::The logic of this particular conspiracy theory was as follows: Angeli was photographed standing next to Vos; Vos is married to Alexandra Pelosi; her mother, Nancy Pelosi, is a critic of Trump; Vos's standing next to Angeli meant they were mutually ideologically sympathetic; therefore, Angeli was in fact an instigator in the Capitol riot, intent on discrediting Trump's supporters, rather than a Trump supporter and QAnon promoter himself. This theory collapses when tested. Firstly, it's true that Vos is married to Speaker Pelosi's daughter Alexandra. That much is not in dispute. However, Vos is also a documentary filmmaker and journalist. On Jan. 6, 2021, he was a correspondent for the Dutch television network RTL 4, reporting from the Capitol riot. One of his dispatches, which included the photograph of Vos and Angeli, can be watched on RTL 4's website. Here's the photograph in its proper, original context::So while conspiracy theorists presented only one possible explanation for Angeli's standing next to Vos, another innocuous, more plausible, and vastly simpler one was available -- Vos encountered Angeli, a striking figure amid any crowd of people, while doing his job and reporting from the riot. No deeper relationship or ideological sympathy was required in order to explain the photograph.In light of the fact that the photograph originated in Vos's own news report for RTL 4, and Angeli has a long track record of supporting Trump and promoting QAnon, the conspiracy theory makes even less sense.Supporters of the theory are required to simultaneously assert as true the propositions that: Vos and Angeli were co-conspirators, along with the Speaker of the House and her daughter, in an elaborate, secret, months-long plot to cultivate Angeli's public persona and then unleash him as an agent provocateur at the Jan. 6 riots; and that, for no explainable reason, Vos decided to voluntarily and unnecessarily make public his sinister connection with Angeli by submitting to RTL 4 a photograph of the two of them, for use as a background visual during one of his telephone dispatches. :Those are two mutually contradictory assertions, and reveal the extent to which the Vos/Angeli conspiracy theory was egregious nonsense."

And on 4 September 2018, accusations flooded the online world when a White House lawyer was seen sitting behind Judge Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing with her right hand making what some viewersinterpreted as the ""white power"" gesture::Kavanaugh's former law clerk Zina Bash is flashing a white power sign behind him during his Senate confirmation hearing.

What a national outrage and a disgrace to the rule of law. pic.twitter.com/uQGOpNa6xg-- Eugene Gu, MD (@eugenegu) September 4, 2018The lawyer, Zina Bash, once served as a clerk for Brett Kavanaugh, who is Trump's second U.S. Supreme Court nominee. She sat directly behind Kavanaugh to his left, where she was widely seen on camera resting her right hand on her left arm, thumb and pointer finger forming a circle.Bash's husband, U.S. attorney John Bash, took to Twitter to blast his wife's accusers, pointing out that she is of Jewish and Mexican descent, and saying the couple has ""nothing to do with hate groups, which aim to terrorize and demean other people -- never have and never would"":The attacks today on my wife are repulsive.

In February 2017, controversy erupted when a Reuters photographer captured Trump adviser Stephen Miller appearing to make the gesture. Similar claims were made again in January 2018 when White House intern Jack Breuer was seen making the gesture during a group photograph. In Miller's case, the absence of video footage made it unclear whether he was flashing the gesture purposely or merely accidentally did so while flaring his fingers to adjust his suit. In the latter case, Breuer said he was mimicking a gesticulation President Trump often makes during speeches and denied he was making a white power sign.Because we can't read minds, we can't discern what anyone's true intentions were in the realm of hand positioning. According to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), an organization that tracks hate groups, the gesture started as a hoax on the Internet message board 4chan in reaction to the sudden rash of media scrutiny placed on white supremacists and the alt-right after the 2016 presidential election:The ""OK"" hand gesture hoax originated in February 2017 when an anonymous 4channer announced ""Operation O-KKK,"" telling other members that ""we must flood Twitter and other social media websites ... claiming that the OK hand sign is a symbol of white supremacy."" The user even provided a helpful graphic showing how the letters WP (for ""white power"") could be traced within an ""OK"" gesture. The originator and others also suggested useful hashtags to help spread the hoax, such as #PowerHandPrivilege and #NotOkay. ""Leftists have dug so deep down into their lunacy,"" wrote the poster, ""We must force [them] to dig more, until the rest of society ain't going anywhere near that s***."":The gesture has been used in the past by what the ADL refers to as ""alt right"" and ""alt lite"" -- far right extremists who range from outright white supremacists to those who publicly shun racists but otherwise fall in step with their belief systems. White supremacist Richard Spencer infamously flashed the sign in front of Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.::When we wrote about the issue eight months ago, Mark Pitcavage, senior research fellow at the ADL's Center on Extremism, told us that even though the gesture amounted to little more than trolling, that didn't mean it couldn't evolve into something more sinister:Right now whenever anyone is using it in this context it's very sort of ironic and trolling. But if it persists there's a chance the ironic aspects of it might fall away with time. That happens organically and it's way too soon to know if the usage will just drop off once they get bored with it, or if they continue to using it ironically in a trolling fashion, or something else.A few days after the original brouhaha, images of Zina Bash making the same symbol at a subsequent day of the Senate hearings were circulated online:Dear @USAttyBash,Remember your long, whiny rant about people being unfair to your wife's hand gesture?Yeah, we're going to need you both to **** off now. pic.twitter.com/JQX6oRFADV-- The Hoarse Whisperer (@HoarseWisperer) September 7, 2018:This behavior drove speculation that Bash (in the second case) was trolling those who had criticized her the first time around:Following accusations that she openly displayed a white supremacist hand gesture during one of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, Zina Bash stoked the flames by making the exact same gesture during another session.Bash once again took a seat behind Kavanaugh and sparked a huge online debate as to whether she deliberately made an OK sign with one of her hands while crossing her arms.On the third day of testimony from Kavanaugh, Bash was recorded yawning behind the judge before once again flashing an OK sign. However, this time Bash appeared to knowingly look directly into the camera while making the otherwise innocuous gesture.Once again, social media was filled with speculation that Bash was trolling those who'd suggested she was making a white-power gesture last time."

Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) homicide detective.Wheeler told the network that his inside sources at MPD and the FBI informed him Rich had ""44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments"" on his computer, and that he had been in contact with WikiLeaks. He added that his sources told him police and the feds were told to ""stand down"" from the murder investigation. The story was picked up and aggregated by multiple web sites, but it only took a few hours for it to fall apart.Wheeler later backtracked on his claims, saying the Fox story wasn't accurate. We have been unable to locate a private detective license under his name in Washington, D.C. or Maryland, where his company, Capitol Investigations, is based.:Rich's family did not ""thank the Internet"" for spreading the false story. On the contrary, they sent a cease and desist letter on 18 May 2017, threatening to sue Wheeler if he continued to make comments about the case to the media. The family also responded vehemently to the rumor through their spokesman Brad Bauman, saying the claims were false and that the stories were exacerbating their grief. The video supposedly showing Rich's parents ""thanking"" people was originally posted to the family's GoFundMe page and uploaded to YouTube on 24 April 2017 -- weeks before Wheeler made the claims. In the video, Rich's parents thank people who donated money to the family's campaign to keep the investigation active until the murder is solved::Despite the fact that the video demonstrably does not show Rich's parents ""thanking the Internet"" for spreading bogus claims about their son, popular right-wing conspiracy site The Gateway Pundit on 21 May 2017 picked up the tweet and reported the false claim along with incorrect details about the murder, while alluding to another debunked (and outlandish) story -- that Rich was en route to meet with the FBI but was taken out by hit men acting on behalf of Clinton:Now it is being reported that the parents of Seth Rich are on the Internet thanking everyone who is helping the family find the two individuals who killed Seth Rich.

473,473,619.TheRepublicanSenateR,"Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.In September 2020, just weeks before the Nov. 3, presidential election, the Republican chairmen of two U.S. Senate committees published a joint report about the business activities of Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, which carried the somewhat dramatic title of ""Hunter Biden, Burisma, and Corruption: The Impact on U.S. Government Policy and Related Concerns.""Right-leaning websites and supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump talked up the findings of the investigation, which was published by U.S. Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin -- the Republican chairmen of the U.S. Senate committees on Finance, and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, respectively.The Daily Wire called it a ""bombshell"" report that contained ""damning new allegations"" against Hunter Biden, while Donald Trump Jr. said the investigation had uncovered a ""laundry list of despicable corruption surrounding Hunter Biden."" Fox News host Sean Hannity, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, said the report ""should immediately disqualify Joe Biden from being the president of the United States."":On Twitter, Trump highlighted one of the most-publicized allegations in the report -- that Hunter Biden had received $3.5 million from Elena Baturina, a Russian billionaire and wife of the former mayor of Moscow. The report represents the latest in a series of allegations against the former vice president's son. Until now, those allegations had been limited to news articles, chiefly published by right-leaning sources, and a book penned by controversial conservative author Peter Schweizer. Grassley and Johnson's report, however, gave those claims a new air of credibility, given their respective offices, and U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky quickly vowed to refer the findings to the Justice Department, for a potential criminal investigation on unspecified charges.Arriving just six days before the first presidential debate on Sept. 29 -- and only six weeks before Election Day -- the report threatened to make Hunter Biden's business dealings a significant issue on the campaign trail, and to provide ammunition for the Trump campaign in its bid to overturn Biden's seven-point lead in national polls.:Grassley and Johnson's report is 87 pages long, and its contents are somewhat complicated in places. Snopes has studied it, in full, along with other background material, and the following is a breakdown of the report's most important and relevant findings -- what it says, and what it doesn't say.In brief, Snopes found that, despite a fanfare of publicity surrounding its release, the report does not present evidence of any wrongdoing by former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, and is flawed in several important ways. Hunter Biden's attorney has already refuted one of its most-publicized claims -- that the Democratic candidate's son received $3.5 million from a Russian billionaire -- telling Snopes it was ""false.""Democratic staff on the two Senate committees have dismissed the report as ""grossly irresponsible,"" telling Snopes it was an attempted smear ""based on secret documents and shoddy investigative work.""Background:BurismaFrom 2014 to 2019, Hunter Biden was a paid member of the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, a large Ukrainian natural gas producer. The company's owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, was investigated for alleged corruption and bribery in the U.K. and Ukraine. Between 2015 and 2016, Ukraine's prosecutor general was Viktor Shokin, whose office conducted an investigation into Zlochevsky.In January 2018, Joe Biden spoke at a Council on Foreign Relations meeting and recounted the pressure that the Obama administration in general, and himself in particular, had placed on Ukraine's government to fire Shokin. That pressure included threatening to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees to the country.Critics of the Bidens, including Trump and his supporters, have stitched together a narrative of corruption based on three facts: Hunter Biden sat on the board of Burisma; Burisma's owner was under investigation by Shokin's office; and Joe Biden pushed Ukraine to fire Shokin, therefore, the former vice president was abusing his power in order to protect his son's employer.:However, that wasn't the case. The Obama administration pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin not because he was fearlessly prosecuting Zlochevsky's alleged corruption, but because he was ineffective in combatting corruption in Ukraine. For months before Joe Biden's personal intervention, officials from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union had been lobbying the Ukrainian government to replace Shokin for the same reasons. This misunderstanding (or knowing misrepresentation) of the motivations and context behind Biden's intervention in the firing of Shokin formed the basis of Trump's pursuit of a criminal investigation, in Ukraine, into Joe and Hunter Biden's activities in the country, and led to an infamous July 2019 phone call with incoming Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Trump asked him to ""do us a favor"" by working with U.S. Attorney General William Barr, and Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, to investigate the Bidens. The Trump administration also temporarily withheld military aid to Ukraine after that phone call, and the affair led to Trump's impeachment trial. Bohai Harvest RST:In 2009 (according to the Senate committees' report), Hunter Biden formed an investment firm called Rosemont Seneca, along with Chris Heinz, the stepson of future Secretary of State John Kerry, and their friend, Devon Archer. In 2013, according to the report, Rosemont Seneca formed a business partnership with a Chinese investment fund called Bohai Capital, resulting in an entity called Bohai Harvest RST. (""RST"" stood for ""Rosemont Seneca Thornton,"" itself a consortium composed of Rosemont Seneca and the Thornton Group, a Massachusetts-based firm.)However, in a statement provided to Snopes, Hunter Biden's attorney George Mesires said: ""Hunter Biden was not a co-founder of Rosemont Seneca Thornton LLC (""RST"") nor did he have an equity interest in RST ...""That distinction has important implications for certain high-profile allegations made against Biden, which this article will examine later. The report presents no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden, and omits testimony that exculpates him: Photo by Paul Morigi/Getty Images for World Food Program USAThe Grassley-Johnson report refers to Joe Biden more than 100 times throughout its 87 pages. However, notably absent from the document is any evidence that Biden himself engaged in any wrongdoing. :In several instances, the report alludes to potential wrongdoing by Biden, and arguably uses innuendo to suggest such actions. One illustrative example can be found on page 3 of the report, which presents the following sequence of events as being meaningful in some unspecified way: ""On April 16, 2014, Vice President Biden met with his son's business partner, Devon Archer, at the White House. Five days later, Vice President Biden visited Ukraine, and he soon after was described in the press as the 'public face of the administration's handling of Ukraine.' The day after his visit, on April 22, Archer joined the board of Burisma ...""Those events were first presented as being connected in Schweizer's 2018 book ""Secret Empires."" What both Schweizer and the committee chairmen fail to mention is that Biden's White House meeting with Archer had, at the very least, another plausible explanation. As The New Yorker reported in July 2019:""Hunter, Archer, and Archer's son Lukas, who is now twelve, told me that the visit was arranged by Hunter for Lukas, who was working on a model of the White House for a grade-school assignment. Afterward, Lukas posted a picture on Instagram of himself shaking the Vice-President's hand. Hunter and Archer said that Burisma was never discussed."":After the release of the Senate committees' report, the author of that New Yorker article, Adam Entous, even tweeted out a video of Biden chatting with young Lukas Archer about his project, ostensibly during that April 16, 2014, visit to the White House.That New Yorker article was published in July 2019, which means it was available to Grassley and Johnson, and we know with certainty that those who wrote the report were aware of it because the document actually cites that very article.Furthermore, the broader suggestion that Biden's visit to Ukraine in April 2014, and his assumption of the role of ""point person"" on Ukraine for the Obama administration, had resulted from some nefarious meeting with his son's business partner and friend, was also fatally flawed. Biden met Archer on April 16, 2014, but the vice president's new role, and his forthcoming visit to Ukraine, had already been set up and publicized by that time. Grassley and Johnson are not obliged to believe that the true purpose of Archer's visit to the White House was a special treat for his young son, but failing to mention that his son accompanied him there is an omission that is unavoidably damaging to the purported credibility and impartiality of their report. It's not the only conspicuous omission from the report. :Concerns Raised Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesThe Senate committees' investigation found that exactly two Obama administration officials raised concerns about the possible perception of a conflict of interest around Hunter Biden's work for Burisma, at a time when his father was leading White House efforts to encourage anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine. :George Kent, former acting deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, told Grassley and Johnson's investigators that he had spoken to national security staff in Biden's office, in February 2015, and expressed concern that Hunter Biden's work with Burisma ""could create the perception of a conflict of interest"" (page 16). In an email sent to State Department colleagues in September 2016, Kent wrote: ""... The presence of Hunter Biden on the Burisma board was very awkward for all US officials pushing an anti-corruption agenda in Ukraine."" (Page 281).However, in an opening statement in his testimony, Kent also said (on page 21): ""... At no time did I witness any efforts by any U.S. official to shield Burisma from scrutiny, and in fact, quite the opposite. I, and other U.S. officials, consistently advocated reconstituting the scuttled investigation of Zlochevsky, Burisma's founder, as well as holding the corrupt prosecutors who had closed the case against him to account ... I am not aware of any occasion in which then Vice President Biden raised Burisma with Ukrainian officials. I am not aware of any wrongdoing by Hunter Biden or the other international members of the Burisma board ..."":Amos Hochstein, former U.S. special envoy and coordinator for International Energy Affairs, testified to the committees' investigation that he had spoken to Joe Biden in October 2015 in order to make Biden aware that Russian actors were using his son's work for Burisma as part of a campaign of disinformation by falsely claiming that it constituted a conflict of interest. Hochstein said he had a similar conversation with Hunter Biden in November 2015. In the same section of his testimony, Hochstein stated unambiguously that Hunter Biden's work with Burisma had never had any bearing whatsoever on U.S. policy towards Ukraine. It's worth quoting that section of Hochstein's testimony in full (from page 73). Here, Hochstein is being questioned by attorney Zach Schram, who is appearing on behalf of Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., the ranking Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee:Schram: Did you change U.S. policy toward Ukraine in any manner to assist Hunter Biden or Burisma?Hochstein: No.Schram: Are you aware of any U.S. official who changed U.S. policy toward Ukraine in any manner to assist Hunter Biden or Burisma?Hochstein: No.Schram: On August 14th of this year, Chairman Johnson stated to One America News that there was, quote, evidence of wrongdoing or illegal activity related to Vice President and Hunter Biden. Do you agree with that characterization?Hochstein: No.Schram: Are you aware of any evidence to support a claim of wrongdoing by Vice President Biden with respect to his policy in Ukraine?Hochstein: No.:Notably, none of this section of Hochstein's testimony was included or mentioned in the final report.Schram put similar questions -- about whether Joe Biden had engaged in any wrongdoing, whether U.S. policy was changed to benefit Hunter Biden, and so on -- to five Obama-era officials. Each one of them gave substantially the same responses: that they were unaware of any wrongdoing of any kind by the former vice president, and unaware of any effort by any official to change U.S. policy, or make any decision whatsoever, in order to benefit either Hunter Biden or Burisma Holdings. The committee lawyers also interviewed Karen Tramontano and Sally Painter, two former Clinton administration officials who work for Blue Star Strategies, an international consultancy firm that was hired by Burisma during the period in question. Both testified, in clear terms, that U.S. policy on Ukraine had never been affected in any way, by considerations of Burisma or Hunter Biden. Remarkably, Grassley and Johnson's report does not mention that clear consensus among the individuals the committees interviewed. Instead, the final report states simply, ""The extent to which Hunter Biden's role on Burisma's board affected U.S. policy toward Ukraine is not clear."":Former U.S. Officials Worry Grassley-Johnson Investigation Product of Russian disinformation Joe Biden (L) and Amos J. Hochstein (BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images):Hochstein, the former State Department official who spoke to Joe and Hunter Biden about his concerns regarding Russian propaganda, told Senate investigators he believes that, five years later, the former vice president is still being targeted by Russian disinformation efforts.  Uninvited, Hochstein volunteered during questioning that he thought the Grassley-Johnson investigation was itself a product of that Russian disinformation campaign:Schram: Do you remain concerned that Vice President Biden is a target of a Russian disinformation effort?Hochstein: Yes.Schram: Why?Hochstein: Because I can see it on a regular basis. I think this investigation is probably the successful outcome of that effort...In his testimony, Hochstein outlined his concerns that the Senate investigation was being used by Russia to ""launder"" false claims and smuggle them into mainstream public debate in the United States. Hochstein referred to Andriy Derkach, a pro-Russian Ukrainian MP who has for years made unsubstantiated allegations that Ukraine -- and not Russia -- orchestrated disinformation campaigns during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and that former vice president Biden had acted corruptly with regard to Ukraine and Burisma. : Rudy Giuliani (L) with Ukrainian MP Andriy Derkach (Source: Andriy Derkach/Facebook)In 2019, Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, traveled to Ukraine and openly met with Derkach as part of an effort to obtain evidence against the Bidens. In September 2020, the U.S. Treasury Department implemented economic sanctions against Derkach, describing him as ""an active Russian agent for over a decade"":From at least late 2019 through mid-2020, Derkach waged a covert influence campaign centered on cultivating false and unsubstantiated narratives concerning U.S. officials in the upcoming 2020 Presidential Election, spurring corruption investigations in both Ukraine and the United States designed to culminate prior to election day. Derkach's unsubstantiated narratives were pushed in Western media through coverage of press conferences and other news events, including interviews and statements.Between May and July 2020, Derkach released edited audio tapes and other unsupported information with the intent to discredit U.S. officials, and he levied unsubstantiated allegations against U.S. and international political figures. Derkach almost certainly targeted the U.S. voting populace, prominent U.S. persons, and members of the U.S. government, based on his reliance on U.S. platforms, English-language documents and videos, and pro-Russian lobbyists in the United States used to propagate his claims.:Schram, the attorney asking questions on behalf of Peters, outlined what he presented as a troubling overlap between several announcements and statements by Derkach, and the timing of meetings, statements and hearings initiated by Republicans on the committees. Schram asked Hochstein if that pattern concerned him. Hochstein said it did (page 61):""... The pattern that concerns me is that it's the laundering of information when someone who has no credibility in Ukraine, let alone anywhere else ... I don't really care what he says in Ukraine. It doesn't bother me. Nobody believes him in Ukraine. What bothers me is that it seems that more people in the United States believe him than people who know him in Ukraine believe him. There, he's discredited, and here, his information, sometimes in a direct leap and sometimes through a stop on the way, gets into the mainstream discussions of U.S. policy.""Hochstein later added:""I had heard these allegations before, except that they usually came from noncredible sources. I was rather disappointed and sad to see that it was coming from more mainstream, as in the United States Senate, which I hold in great regard and great esteem."":None of this section of Hochstein's testimony was included or mentioned in Grassley and Johnson's final report.In his testimony (on page 27), Kent said he was ""concerned that some of their [the committees'] activities could be exploited to advance a Russian agenda"" and expressed a concern that Derkach's ""unsubstantiated allegations have also been amplified by some Americans,"" including Giuliani. Anita Decker Breckenridge, records representative to former President Barack Obama and formerly White House deputy chief of staff for operations, was responsible for responding to the committees' requests for certain Obama-era records, as part of the Grassley-Johnson investigation. In her reply, she put on record her view that the request ""serves no legitimate purpose"" and ""[gives] credence to a Russia disinformation campaign"" but ultimately handed over the records ""in the interest of countering the misinformation campaign underlying this request."" In March 2020, she wrote (on page 398):President Obama has consistently supported the nonpartisan administration of presidential records and the commitment to transparency core to NARA's [the National Archives and Records Administrations] mission. However, the current request is not a proper use of the limited NARA exceptions. It arises out of efforts by some, actively supported by Russia, to shift the blame for Russian interference in the 2016 election to Ukraine ...The request for early release of presidential records in order to give credence to a Russian disinformation campaign -- one that has already been thoroughly investigated by a bipartisan congressional committee -- is without precedent ... This use of the special access process serves no legitimate purpose, and does not outweigh or justify infringing confidentiality interests that all presidents have sought to protect. Nevertheless, in the interest of countering the misinformation campaign underlying this request, we are prepared on this occasion to provide the Committees access to the records responsive to this request. :The Republican authors of the final report firmly denied that they were advancing a Russian disinformation campaign, claiming that that was, itself, an unfounded conspiracy theory. They attributed to theory to Democratic lawmakers on the two committees, a misleading characterization because it omits to mention the trenchant concerns raised by non-partisan officials. Report Hints at, but Doesn't Prove, Criminal Financial Activity by Hunter Biden U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) participates in hearing (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images):Perhaps the most salacious allegations in the report, and the most widely publicized ones, relate to Hunter Biden's personal financial affairs. In particular, the report alleges the following: ""Hunter Biden received a $3.5 million wire transfer from Elena Baturina, the wife of the former mayor of Moscow.""$3.5 millionPresident Trump himself tweeted out the ""$3.5 million"" claim, as did his son, Donald Trump Jr., and it also formed the basis of articles by the New York Post, Fox News, the Daily Mail, Newsweek and the Federalist. Here's what the final report says about that alleged $3.5 million payment (on page 69):Hunter Biden and his associate, Archer, had a financial relationship with Russian businesswoman Elena Baturina. Baturina is the former wife of the late Yuri Luzhkov, who was the mayor of Moscow and was fired in 2010 by then-Russian president Dmitry Medvedev over corruption allegations. Baturina became Russia's only female billionaire when her plastics company, Inteko, received a series of Moscow municipal contracts while her husband was mayor....On Feb. 14, 2014, Baturina wired $3.5 million to a Rosemont Seneca Thornton LLC (Rosemont Seneca Thornton) bank account for a ""Consultancy Agreement DD12.02.2014."" Rosemont Seneca Thornton is an investment firm co-founded by Hunter Biden that was incorporated on May 28, 2013 in Wilmington, Del.However, Hunter Biden's attorney, George Mesires, refuted this claim, which the report describes as one of the investigation's ""key findings."" In a statement sent to Snopes, Mesires wrote:""The Senate report falsely alleges that Hunter Biden had a financial relationship with Russian businesswoman Yelena Baturina and that he received $3.5 million from Baturina.  Hunter Biden was not a co-founder of Rosemont Seneca Thornton LLC (""RST"") nor did he have an equity interest in RST, so the claim that he was paid $3.5 million is false.""None of the news reports referenced above contained any evidence that their authors had sought comment from Hunter Biden on the Baturina allegation. We asked Grassley and Johnson for a response to Mesires' statement, but we didn't receive a response of any kind. In a minority report, Democratic staff from the two Senate committees slammed the Republican-led investigation as ""grossly irresponsible"" and unprecedented in its methods, writing on page 48:The Republican Chairmen's use of confidential Treasury documents to justify its unsubstantiated allegations and personal attacks against Vice President Biden's family is grossly irresponsible. The information in the documents cited by the Republicans has not been verified, and we are not aware of any other Congressional committee ever releasing this sort of information in this manner....The Chairmen spent a year investigating Russian-backed allegations of wrongdoing by Vice President Biden in Ukraine, only to find the allegations discredited by their own investigation. Here the Republicans made no attempt to independently investigate the transactions at issue, perhaps to avoid the embarrassment of seeing these allegations discredited as well. 'Prostitution, and or Human Trafficking'Another ""key finding"" from the report was the allegation that: ""Hunter Biden paid nonresident women who were nationals of Russia or other Eastern European countries and who appear to be linked to an 'Eastern European prostitution or human trafficking ring.'""Predictably, this allegation attracted widespread news coverage, including articles by Fox News, the New York Post, the Daily Mail, the Sun, and the Federalist. However, its sourcing appears rather uncertain. In a footnote on page 67, the report states that:There is extensive public reporting concerning Hunter Biden's alleged involvement with prostitution services. Records on file with the Committees do not directly confirm or refute these individual reports. However, they do confirm that Hunter Biden sent thousands of dollars to individuals who have either: 1) been involved in transactions consistent with possible human trafficking; 2) an association with the adult entertainment industry; or 3) potential association with prostitution. Some recipients of those funds are Ukrainian and Russian citizens.The records note that it is a documented fact that Hunter Biden has sent funds to nonresident alien women in the United States who are citizens of Russia and Ukraine and who have subsequently wired funds they have received from Hunter Biden to individuals located in Russia and Ukraine. The records also note that some of these transactions are linked to what ""appears to be an Eastern European prostitution or human trafficking ring.""The first thing to note is that the ""extensive public reporting"" in question appears to amount, in fact, to a single article published by the New York Post in March 2017. It was based on a leaked court filing from Hunter Biden's divorce from his wife, Kathleen, who accused him of ""spending extravagantly on his own interests (including drugs, alcohol, prostitutes, strip clubs, and gifts for women with whom he has sexual relations) ...""Speaking to The New Yorker in the summer of 2019, Hunter Biden denied hiring prostitutes. Secondly, the footnote itself notes that the committees don't have evidence that directly confirms the claim that Hunter Biden hired prostitutes. Rather, it states that ""records on file"" with the two committees point to patterns of transactions and payments involving Biden which suggest a link to prostitution or human trafficking.It's not clear what the nature of those records is. Elsewhere in the report, claims about payments and transactions are linked to citations of specific ""confidential documents"", for example ""Confidential Document 1"", ""Confidential Document 14"" and so on. Those typically appear to be bank records. However, the allegation that Biden sent thousands of dollars to women linked to prostitution is not cited in that way, and the alleged payments are not referred to separately, or cited separately. This would tend to suggest that the ""records on file with the committees"" are not bank statements. The footnote also refers to the records in a somewhat unusual way, for example: ""The records note that it is a documented fact that Hunter Biden has sent funds to nonresident alien women ..."" and ""The records also note that some of these transactions are linked to..."" If the records constituted concrete evidence of Biden's transactions, then it would make more sense to say ""The records show that ..."" It is notable that the report doesn't describe them in that way, and it suggests some measure of distance between concrete proof of Biden's alleged payments, and the records on file with the committees. Snopes asked Grassley and Johnson for further details about those records, including their format, their author(s), and why they hadn't been specifically cited in the report, or published as exhibits. We also asked for copies of the records in question. We did not receive a response of any kind.Other ClaimsThe Grassley-Johnson report also details business connections between Hunter Biden and several Chinese nationals who, according to the report, have ""deep connections to the Communist Chinese government."" In particular, the report addresses BHR Partners, a fund created by a 2013 agreement between Rosemont Seneca and Bohai Capital. The report details multiple transactions between Hunter Biden, his uncle, James Biden, and James Biden's wife, Sara, and entities associated with Ye Jianming, a businessman reportedly detained in China on suspicion of financial crimes, as well as Patrick Ho, an associate of Ye, who was convicted in 2019 of international bribery and money laundering.  The transactions in question are rather convoluted, and some of the individuals and entities involved certainly appear questionable. However, the Grassley-Johnson report does not articulate specific acts of wrongdoing, or criminal offenses, by Hunter Biden or his family members."
474,474,407.DidSevenKeyWitnesses,"Claim:Seven ""key witnesses"" to the 1 October 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas have suspiciously died in a cover-up.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 2 November 2017, the disreputable web site Neon Nettle reported falsely that seven ""key witnesses"" to the mass shooting on the Las Vegas Strip one month earlier had died under ""suspicious circumstances"", and that there was a ""sinister"" plot afoot to snuff out people who made statements in the immediate aftermath of the massacre that appeared to support the conspiracy theory trope that there was more than one shooter that night.:Law enforcement leading the investigation into the massacre have concluded that Stephen Paddock, 64, was the lone gunman on 1 October 2017, when he opened fire with a modified weapon from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino onto a crowd below attending an outdoor country music festival. Neon Nettle, along with other conspiratorial web sites, have been aggressively pushing the idea that Paddock had an accomplice. Conspiracy buffs have decided that the Las Vegas shooting was yet another massive cover-up -- a ""false flag,"" or government-engineered catastrophe meant to facilitate a nationwide gun-grab in the service of an ominous global cabal waiting in the wings to seize world power.With great paranoia, Neon Nettle reported:In the month that followed the incident, a staggering seven key witnesses have died in very suspicious circumstances.Whether this series of disturbing deaths and disappearances are purely coincidental or whether there is something deeply sinister afoot has yet to be determined.In cases like these, however, there's no such thing as coincidence.:None of the deaths of ""key witnesses"" mentioned in the Neon Nettle story were linked, other than the fact some of them were part of a crowd of at least 22,000 people attending the outdoor Route 91 Harvest Festival when the shooting took place. Among the seven named, two died in an apparent car accident. One appears to have been misidentified by conspiracy theorists. A third is, in fact, not dead, while another had serious medical complications. In another instance, the deceased had no link whatsoever to the mass shooting, while the final ""key witness"" named, in display of sheer laziness by Neon Nettle, is Paddock, the shooter.Dennis and Lorraine Carver: Lorraine Carver allegedly wrote on social media that her husband protected her from ""shooters"". Carver and her husband Dennis were killed on 16 October 2017 in a car accident near their home in Murrieta, California, when their car veered off a curve in a road at 10:50 P.M., striking a metal gate and catching fire. Both were pronounced dead at the scene.Danny Contreras: On 23 October 2017, police and fire personnel discovered the body of Danny Contreras, 35, who died of multiple gunshot wounds in a vacant home in Las Vegas. Police said they believe the homicide was narcotics-related. According to Neon Nettle, a now-suspended Twitter account apparently being used by a person using that name posted that he was lucky to have gotten out of the concert alive after being chased by two men with guns. However there is no evidence that the homicide victim was the same person who wrote the tweets -- comparison of an image on a fundraiser for the murdered man launched on 25 October 2017 in North Las Vegas and the profile picture of the man pointed out by Neon Nettle appears to demonstrate that they are in fact two different people.:Chad Nishimura: Neon Nettle initially and falsely reported Nishimura, a Mandalay Bay hotel worker ""disappeared"" after he told a local news station he had valeted Paddock's car and said Paddock ""didn't have any crazy bags with him that I can remember."" The conspiratorial web site is now reporting Nishimura was murdered outside the Las Vegas church, Iglesia La Luz del Mundo. A man named Hector Antonio Lemus-Flores, 45, of North Las Vegas, was murdered on 16 October 2017 outside that church. Neon Nettle simply transposed the details of Lemus-Flores' death onto their story to falsely claim the victim had been Nishimura, who is alive.Kymberley Suchomel: 28-year-old Suchomel passed away in her sleep a week after the massacre. According to her grandmother, who found her in bed in her Apple Valley, California home on 9 October 2017, Suchomel had seizures and was taking medication for a tumor. Suchomel was apparently experiencing trouble sleeping as sounds and images from the massacre would terrorize her at night. She drew the attention of conspiracy theorists with a now-private Facebook post attributed to her in which she said there was more than one shooter, writing::We couldn't hide because they (and I do mean THEY) were chasing us.John Beilman: On 4 October 2017, Beilman, 60, shot and killed his severely-disabled 27-year-old daughter in the backyard of their Fairport, New York home before turning the gun on himself. There is no connection between that tragedy and the Las Vegas massacre -- a link between the two deadly incidents was established exclusively by disreputable conspiracy sites like WhatDoesItMean. According to RationalWiki, the work on that web site is of such quality that ""even other conspiracy nutters don't think much of it.""The seventh ""key witness"" included on Neon Nettle's list is the shooter himself, Stephen Paddock. After shooting at the crowd for 10 minutes, Paddock turned his weapon on himself. Of course Paddock wasn't a ""witness."" He was the perpetrator. He was included in the list perhaps as an effort to ramp up the cloak-and-dagger effect or simply beef up the body count -- Neon Nettle implied there had been suspicious circumstances for his death as well::Reports varied about how Paddock was killed with some initial statements saying he was killed in a police shootout, with the ""official"" story now saying he turned a weapon on himself.According to police radio traffic which can be found archived at Broadcastify, Paddock did not exchange gunfire with police. When they breached the door and went inside, Paddock was already down."

Various posts argue that the rituals include humiliation and enduring pain in a quest to become more powerful. Some versions of the theory note that it is the left eye that tends to be bruised, indicating some kind of pattern.  :Some routinely connect QAnon theories to pictures of famous people with black eyes, arguing that these injuries are a result of ""adrenochrome injections."" QAnon conspiracy theorists have long asserted that child traffickers ""harvest"" children for their blood, which purportedly contains a life-giving substance called adrenochrome, which is prized by the wealthy and powerful around the world.However, the above photograph is not an indication that Hanks, Winfrey, and King are part of any kind of ""Black Eye Club."" The photograph is real, however. It was uploaded to Winfrey's official Instagram account in 2013 when she and King went to see Hanks perform in a play. The play was titled ""Lucky Guy,"" and Hanks played tabloid journalist Mike McAlary in his Broadway debut. The caption of the Instagram post read, ""Just saw LUCKY GUY . @TomHanks and whole cast Reeaaaaly great!. Wish I was a Tony voter."" :It is not clear if Hanks is actually sporting a black eye in the image. The lighting in the image showed the left side of his face as darker, which is not evidence that he had an injury over his eye. However, during the play, his character is in a car crash, at which point it is possible he wore some eye makeup.Regardless, footage from other parts of the play shows him performing without any black eye. :This did not stop a commenter from posting ""What happened to Tom's left eye?"" under the photo. Online commentators attempted to connect the photograph to a range of conspiracy theories, including the ""Red Shoe Club,"" ""Pizzagate,"" and more. :Since the photograph is real but not an indication of membership in a ""Black Eye Club,"" nor is it certain that Hanks sported a real black eye in it, we rate this photograph as Miscaptioned.

It is believed they were terrorizing the young girl, deliberately causing the child's body to release Adenochrome into her bloodstream before bleeding her out and drinking the blood during a Satanic ritual sacrifice.Adrenochrome is an oxidation product of adrenaline (ephinephrine, norepinephrine) that is extracted from a living donor's adrenal gland. According to those familiar with the elites' drug of choice, the high is ""intense"" and ""exotic"".:The reports amounted to an escalation of a thoroughly discredited conspiracy theory (associated with such hashtags as #Pizzagate, #SpiritCooking, and #QAnon) alleging that Clinton and other so-called ""deep state"" conspirators run a massive Satanic pedophile ring based out of a Washington, DC pizzeria. YourNewsWire has granted uncritical credence to such theories in the past.The article's author, ""Baxter Dmitry,"" took his cues from social media posts featuring still images allegedly extracted from the mysterious ""#Frazzledrip"" video. One of the earliest such posts appeared on Facebook during the first week of April 2018: (Facebook screenshot):Similar posts were widely shared on Twitter: (Twitter screenshot):However, it only took a few moments of investigating to determine that the sepia-toned images came not from incriminating footage found in some dank corner of the dark web, but rather from a maniacally inscrutable YouTube video uploaded (coincidentally or not) on April Fools Day 2018 (regrettably, that video has since been deleted).We found, moreover, that the image purporting to show Huma Abedin wearing a mask made from the face of a mutilated child (discernible at the 1:23 minute mark in the above video) was actually taken from the website of a well-known ""underground"" Indian restaurant in Washington, DC, called Hush Supper Club. The masked woman is the restaurant's proprietor, Geeta, who has been profiled in a number of national news venues.Here is the photograph in its original context::Insofar as it's supposed to serve as evidence that Huma Abedin participated in a Satanic ritual involving the mutilation of a child, then, the video is demonstrably a hoax. However, that hasn't stopped social media users from trying to find other imagery in the video to support the ""snuff film"" thesis, though the results -- even with the addition of visual aids -- remain laughably incomprehensible: (Screenshot):In point of fact, there appeared to be some disagreement among conspiracy theorists as to whether the two-minute YouTube clip and the much-ballyhooed ""Frazzledrip"" video were even one and the same.

This image, however, is a digital manipulation. The fake image was created by doctoring a genuine photograph of a crop circle that was reportedly created in a wheat field in Wiltshire, England, in the summer of 2004. Here's a look at the original photograph (left) and the doctored image (right)::The Temporary Temple, a group that archives crop-circle images, has a few other images that show this real crop circle from various angles. Although crop circles may have once conjured up images about mysterious alien visitors, these displays typically have earthly origins. Crop circles may be created by hoaxers, artists, or even advertisers. In 2014, for instance, the technology company NVIDIA created a crop circle resembling a computer chip:Instead -- surprise! -- it was a stunt intended to attract publicity to the release of a mobile processor used in automobiles, tablets and cell phones made by the computer graphics company NVIDIA, according to its president and CEO, Jen-Hsun Huang.""It is true. The NVIDIA marketing team is behind this phenomenon,"" Huang said as he stood in front of a picture of the manicured field. ""What you're looking at here is 310 feet in diameter. It is what people call a crop circle."":While we have been unable to dig up much information about the 2004 crop circle in Wiltshire, England, this community does have a rich crop circle history. In the 1970s, pranksters Doug Bower and Dave Chorley captured the attention of extraterrestrial enthusiasts when they created crop circles there. Smithsonian Magazine reported:When Doug Bower and his co-conspirator Dave Chorley first created a representation of a ""flying saucer nest"" in a wheat field in Wiltshire, England, in 1976, they could not have foreseen that their work would become a cultural phenomenon.[...]Before today's circle-makers entered the picture, there had been scattered reports of odd patterns appearing in crops, ranging from 17th century pamphlets to an 1880 account in Nature to a letter from astronomer Patrick Moore printed in 1963 in New Scientist. In Australia, the mid- to late-1960s saw occasional reports of circles in crops, and they were often ascribed to UFO landings. At around the same time in England, the Wiltshire town of Warminster became a center of UFO-seeking ""sky watches"" and gave birth to its own rumors of crop circles, or ""saucer nests."" None of these, unfortunately, was photographed.It was such legends that Bower had in mind when, over a drink one evening in 1976, he suggested to his pal Chorley: ""Let's go over there and make it look like a flying saucer has landed."" It was time, thought Doug, to see a saucer nest for himself.:The digitally manipulated image of a crop circle resembling the Microsoft Windows logo and the crown of the coronavirus was frequently shared on social media by those alleging some sort of connection between former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates and the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images):Without evidence to support the claim, the meme alleged the person flanking Angeli's left side, holding a Trump flag, and wearing a badge around his neck was actually 18-year-old Thunberg in a disguise.In other words, the post wanted viewers to believe Thunberg's international reputation for ringing the alarm on climate change was actually a facade to cover her American far-right extremism, or that she was operating undercover as a left-wing activist to try to make Trump supporters look bad.The former theory was a far stretch considering Trump's history of publicly mocking Thunberg on Twitter, and the latter claim centered on the thoroughly-debunked QAnon conspiracy theory that anti-fascist activists actually instigated the violence at the Capitol -- when, in reality, the FBI said there was ""no indication"" that anyone from that leftist movement was involved in the attack.Nonetheless, the meme's allegation was false. Despite the fact that the person photographed holding the Trump flag and the teenage activist had notable differences in their facial shapes and structures, we looked for any evidence to support the claim that Thunberg was a member of the crowd. We found none.:For argument's sake, had she dressed up as a Trump supporter and participated in the siege to try to overthrow Biden's presidential win (for whatever reason), the discovery would not likely emerge first as an uncredited meme, but rather as a major news story from a reputable source, considering Thunberg's prominence.Additionally, the person next to Angeli was identified, not as the international activist, but as a male employee of a Maryland-based marketing production company, according to news reports and a statement from Navistar Direct Marketing obtained by Snopes.:The company identified him based on the badge around his neck and subsequently fired him for his involvement in the insurrection, according to the statement, which is displayed below. No further details, such as his name or motivation for leading the siege, were publicly available.Authorities believe more than 800 people made their way into the Capitol on Jan. 6, according to The Associated Press. As of this report, prosecutors were considering charging some of them with sedition, which carries up to 20 years in prison, and had charged others with crimes including unlawful entry and disorderly conduct.:In sum, considering the unsubstantiated claims that Thunberg was a closeted Trump supporter or left-wing agent provocateur, as well as proof that the person in question was a male employee of a Maryland-based marketing company, we rate this claim ""False."""

In the days that followed, a rumor was circulated on social media claiming that Hutchins had posted ""I have information that will lead to Hillary Clinton's arrest"" on Twitter shortly before her death. :This is not a genuine message from Hutchins. This is a doctored tweet. The implication of the message above is that Hutchins was purposefully killed to protect Clinton. This follows in the footsteps of a long-standing conspiracy theory that has attempted to link numerous ""suspicious"" deaths to the Clinton family. This tweet, however, is fake. :But we have not been able to find any traces of this message online. While there is a @HalynaHutchins Twitter account, this account is relatively new -- it was started in April 2021 -- and it doesn't appear that messages have been posted from the account.

The account in the doctored meme does have a verified symbol. It seems likely that this tweet was created with one of several ""fake tweet"" generators. Hutchins did have a genuine Instagram account. Before her death, she posted about how working on a western afforded her the opportunity to ride horses, how she stood with her crew, and about the incredible views in New Mexico. We looked over her recent posts and didn't find anything overtly political, or anything related to Clintons. This is not the first piece of disinformation to circulate in the wake of Hutchins' death.

481,481,366.RubyFreemanWasNotArr,"Claim:The FBI arrested Georgia election worker Ruby Freeman in December 2020. Rating:FalseAbout this rating OriginOn Dec. 17, 2020, dozens of Twitter accounts started spamming social media with near-verbatim messages falsely claiming that a woman named Ruby Freeman had been arrested by the FBI for crimes related to election fraud in Atlanta, Georgia.:The viral copypasta read:""HUGE BREAKING NEWS! Ruby Freeman (the Democrat suitcase blonde-braid woman in GA) has been arrested! She has acknowledged to law enforcement and investigators her role in the Fulton County methods of GOP witness complaints and the after hours ballot scheme count.""There was no truth to this rumor. The FBI did not arrest Ruby Freeman for election fraud and this person was not suspected (outside of conspiracy-minded circles) of any illegal activity related to the 2020 election. While most of the iterations of this viral message that we encountered simply contained the message above, some versions were part of longer Twitter threads that included additional claims about various charges that the FBI allegedly filed against Freeman. The longer versions of this rumor claimed that the ""source"" of the information was an FBI statement posted in the early hours of Dec. 17. However, we found no such news release. We looked through the websites and social media pages of the FBI, the FBI's Atlanta Division, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Georgia, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia, and the Fulton County Police Department, but found no mention of Freeman's alleged arrest. :The false rumors about Freeman's arrest were just another installment in a weeks-long smear campaign against the U.S. electoral process. In early December, U.S. President Donald Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani, disreputable websites such as the Gateway Pundit, and conspiracy-minded social media users started sharing a video that showed an election worker they identified as Freeman allegedly removing ballots from a ""suitcase."" While Giuliani and others have claimed without evidence that this ""suitcase"" (which was actually a standard absentee ballot container, according to Georgia elections officials) was filled with illegal ballots, election officials labeled this claim ""ridiculous"" and offered a much more reasonable explanation. The New York Times reported:Late on Nov. 3, election workers in Fulton County, Georgia, heard that they would be allowed to go home for the night. So they packed uncounted ballots into suitcases and prepared to lock up for the evening.When word came that they couldn't leave yet, they dragged the suitcases back out and began counting the ballots again.That singular scene -- of workers taking out suitcases of votes -- was then selectively edited and shared by allies of President Trump as a conspiracy theory that election workers had dragged out fraudulent ballots under the cover of night. According to the theory, those suitcases helped swing Georgia's Electoral College votes to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.But on Monday, Georgia's secretary of state office dedicated part of a morning news conference to debunking that falsehood and many others, in what was called ""Disinformation Monday."" Gabriel Sterling, the voting implementation manager in Georgia and a Republican, said in the news conference that watching the entire surveillance footage of Election Day showed that workers had first packed the suitcases with valid, uncounted ballots and then later unpacked those same ballots. They had not taken out suitcases full of fake ballots, he said.:After the suitcase-of-fraud claims were dismissed by election officials, social media users started sharing a ""confession"" that Freeman supposedly posted to her Instagram account. This Instagram account, however, does not actually belong to Freeman. Shortly after this ""confession"" went viral, the @RubyFreeman_Georgia Instagram account (which was created on the same day this message was posted), started sharing content that mocked those who fell for its ruse. In addition to falsely accusing this woman of confessing to election fraud, many social media users also passed around a mug shot of an entirely different ""Ruby Freeman"" in an apparent attempt to further smear her character or resuscitate this rumor. The accusations against Freeman were without merit, as were a plethora of claims holding that the 2020 presidential election was marred by widespread voter fraud. Claims of voter fraud have been dismissed by election officials and lawsuits alleging fraud have been dismissed by judges across the country.:As for Ruby Freeman, she was not arrested by the FBI and she is not suspected (outside of conspiracy-minded circles) of any wrongdoing related to the 2020 election.

Nonetheless, conspiracy sites asserted that Moore ""died of an apparent seizure,"" citing non-specific ""preliminary reports"" from police:Investigative Journalist Jen Moore was found dead in a suburban Washington D.C. hotel room, according to police and shocked and distraught friends and colleagues.Moore died of an apparent seizure. Police are closely investigating the cause of death in Prince George's County, Maryland. Preliminary reports from police said the death was not the result of suicide.Moore's body was found by employees at the Country Inn & Suites by Radisson, Washington, D.C. East - in Capitol Heights, Maryland. The investigation is ongoing. An autopsy had not been scheduled as of late Monday.Prince George's County police spokesperson Cpl. Lamar Robinson told us that local authorities do not believe Moore's death came under suspicious circumstances.:Moore (whose identification as an ""investigative journalist"" apparently stems from her activity posting conspiracy theory videos to YouTube under the screen name ""Task Force"") supposedly died just after contacting officials at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with information she gleaned from interviewing a 26-year-old man -- a man who allegedly claimed that former president Bill Clinton had sexually assaulted him, and that he had been ""pimped out"" to private events held by ""elites"" in Washington D.C. (Various blogs contradictorily claimed that Moore died either either one week or four weeks after supposedly contacting federal investigators.)Whether Moore actually interviewed a subject who made such allegations, and whether Moore in fact reported those allegations to the DHS and FBI shortly before her death remains unconfirmed. The claims that she did stem primarily from an article published TruePundit.com, an unreliable conspiracy-driven website that has a long history of claiming possession of exclusive FBI information, and that publishes pseudonymously-bylined articles while providing no contact information.:Several blog posts also included screen captures of text messages purportedly sent by Moore saying that she thought that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was the ""best place to go"" with her allegations because ""the top FBI are blackmailed or involved."" According to Moore, President Donald Trump had ordered ICE's homeland security investigations unit to focus on arresting child traffickers, and because of that, she said, ""the Dems and some [Republicans] are trying to disband"" the agency.In fact, the push to abolish ICE has been credited to a liberal activist, Sean McElwee, after he first used the term on Twitter in February 2017. In June 2018, 19 special agents from that agency asked Homeland Security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to spin them off into their own agency in order to avoid their being associated with deportation efforts that have led to public criticism of ICE.Homeland Security officials did not respond to our request for comment. An FBI spokesperson told us via email that, per bureau policy, they could not confirm whether they had or had not been contacted by Moore.:"

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.Something is rotten in the state of American political life. The U.S. (among other nations) is increasingly characterized by highly polarized, informationally insulated ideological communities occupying their own factual universes. Within the conservative political blogosphere, global warming is either a hoax or so uncertain as to be unworthy of response. Within other geographic or online communities, vaccines, fluoridated water and genetically modified foods are known to be dangerous. Right-wing media outlets paint a detailed picture of how Donald Trump is the victim of a fabricated conspiracy.None of that is correct, though. The reality of human-caused global warming is settled science. The alleged link between vaccines and autism has been debunked as conclusively as anything in the history of epidemiology. It's easy to find authoritative refutations of Donald Trump's self-exculpatory claims regarding Ukraine and many other issues.:Yet many well-educated people sincerely deny evidence-based conclusions on these matters.In theory, resolving factual disputes should be relatively easy: Just present evidence of a strong expert consensus. This approach succeeds most of the time, when the issue is, say, the atomic weight of hydrogen.But things don't work that way when the scientific consensus presents a picture that threatens someone's ideological worldview. In practice, it turns out that one's political, religious or ethnic identity quite effectively predicts one's willingness to accept expertise on any given politicized issue.""Motivated reasoning"" is what social scientists call the process of deciding what evidence to accept based on the conclusion one prefers. As I explain in my book, ""The Truth About Denial,"" this very human tendency applies to all kinds of facts about the physical world, economic history and current events.:The same facts will sound different to people depending on what they already believe.AP Photo/John Raoux:Denial doesn't stem from ignoranceThe interdisciplinary study of this phenomenon has exploded over just the last six or seven years. One thing has become clear: The failure of various groups to acknowledge the truth about, say, climate change, is not explained by a lack of information about the scientific consensus on the subject.Instead, what strongly predicts denial of expertise on many controversial topics is simply one's political persuasion.A 2015 metastudy showed that ideological polarization over the reality of climate change actually increases with respondents' knowledge of politics, science and/or energy policy. The chances that a conservative is a climate change denier is significantly higher if he or she is college-educated. Conservatives scoring highest on tests for cognitive sophistication or quantitative reasoning skills are most susceptible to motivated reasoning about climate science. :This is not just a problem for conservatives. As researcher Dan Kahan has demonstrated, liberals are less likely to accept expert consensus on the possibility of safe storage of nuclear waste, or on the effects of concealed-carry gun laws.Denial is naturalOur ancestors evolved in small groups, where cooperation and persuasion had at least as much to do with reproductive success as holding accurate factual beliefs about the world. Assimilation into one's tribe required assimilation into the group's ideological belief system. An instinctive bias in favor of one's ""in-group"" and its worldview is deeply ingrained in human psychology.A human being's very sense of self is intimately tied up with his or her identity group's status and beliefs. Unsurprisingly, then, people respond automatically and defensively to information that threatens their ideological worldview. We respond with rationalization and selective assessment of evidence - that is, we engage in ""confirmation bias,"" giving credit to expert testimony we like and find reasons to reject the rest.:Political scientists Charles Taber and Milton Lodge experimentally confirmed the existence of this automatic response. They found that partisan subjects, when presented with photos of politicians, produce an affective ""like/dislike"" response that precedes any sort of conscious, factual assessment as to who is pictured. In ideologically charged situations, one's prejudices end up affecting one's factual beliefs. Insofar as you define yourself in terms of your cultural affiliations, information that threatens your belief system - say, information about the negative effects of industrial production on the environment - can threaten your sense of identity itself. If it's part of your ideological community's worldview that unnatural things are unhealthful, factual information about a scientific consensus on vaccine or GM food safety feels like a personal attack. Unwelcome information can also threaten in other ways. ""System justification"" theorists like psychologist John Jost have shown how situations that represent a threat to established systems trigger inflexible thinking and a desire for closure. For example, as Jost and colleagues extensively review, populations experiencing economic distress or external threat have often turned to authoritarian, hierarchicalist leaders promising security and stability.:Everyone sees the world through one partisan lens or another, based on their identity and beliefs.Vladyslav Starozhylov/Shutterstock.comDenial is everywhere:This kind of affect-laden, motivated thinking explains a wide range of examples of an extreme, evidence-resistant rejection of historical fact and scientific consensus.Have tax cuts been shown to pay for themselves in terms of economic growth? Do communities with high numbers of immigrants have higher rates of violent crime? Did Russia interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election? Predictably, expert opinion regarding such matters is treated by partisan media as though evidence is itself inherently partisan.Denialist phenomena are many and varied, but the story behind them is, ultimately, quite simple. Human cognition is inseparable from the unconscious emotional responses that go with it. Under the right conditions, universal human traits like in-group favoritism, existential anxiety and a desire for stability and control combine into a toxic, system-justifying identity politics.When group interests, creeds, or dogmas are threatened by unwelcome factual information, biased thinking becomes denial. And unfortunately these facts about human nature can be manipulated for political ends. :This picture is a bit grim, because it suggests that facts alone have limited power to resolve politicized issues like climate change or immigration policy. But properly understanding the phenomenon of denial is surely a crucial first step to addressing it.Adrian Bardon, Professor of Philosophy, Wake Forest UniversityThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Biden was alive, as of July 3, 2023.:On July 2, 2023, a video purportedly showing at least one body bag or casket being wheeled out of the White House went viral.

Biden was alive, as of July 3, 2023.:We reached out to the White House asking what the video showed being moved, seemingly on wheels, and we will update this post when, or if, we receive a response.The full origin story of the video was unknown -- that is, we don't know who, or what agency, recorded it or posted it online first. It appeared to show footage from a security camera directed at the White House's front lawn, positioned somewhere high in front of the entrance's gate. There were no signs of digital manipulation.At the very beginning, viewers can see the video's timestamp: June 23, 2022. An unidentified person can then be seen rolling out a long, black object (what conspiracy theories claim to be a body bag). Another figure follows, pushing a similar-looking black object. After that, a nearby black car can be seen driving away.Shortly after the date in the video's timestamp, it appeared on social media. We found TikTok videos sharing the same footage in June 2022. Those videos also circulated with captions speculating whether the footage showed a body bag leaving the White House. : :For several reasons, it was impossible that the video showed Biden's body leaving the White House. Firstly, Biden was alive, as of this writing, and he made numerous public appearances since June 2022 (when the footage was seemingly recorded). Per his publicly available calendar, he participated in the G7 Summit  soon after the video's timestamp of June 23, 2022, and the NATO Summit in Spain after that. Secondly, if Biden were to die while in office, it would be highly unlikely that his body would be quietly rolled out in a casket, or body bag, from a door that appears to be near the White House's front entrance, without any spectacle. After former or current presidents die, it is common procedure for them to lie in state for mourners to pay respects. For example, John F. Kennedy's body was temporarily kept in a coffin in the East Room of the White House, where officials paid respects. Then, the next day, officials moved his body to the Capitol Rotunda for the public to visit. (Abraham Lincoln's funeral proceedings followed a similar routine.) Franklin D. Roosevelt lay in state in the East Room for a few hours, mourners gathered there, and then his body was taken to New York to be buried.:And, lastly, the death of a sitting president would be eminently newsworthy, and the public would be aware of such an event via reports by credible news publications. That had not happened.In addition to the Biden-body-bag conspiracy, other posts online claimed at least one of the objects being removed was the president's ""body double.""its just routine replacement of the biden clone chill out https://t.co/5mksgzp8JY-- stillcant tweet (@eryx_x01) July 3, 2023:The Biden ""clone"" or ""body-double"" conspiracy theory has circulated since at least 2020.

In February 2023, Kevin O' Connor, the president's physician, described Biden as a ""healthy, vigorous, 80-year-old male"" who is ""fit to execute the duties of the Presidency.""Given that the in-question video had been posted online more than a year before claims surfaced about it allegedly showing Biden's body, and we know Biden was alive after the footage was seemingly recorded, we rated this claim as ""Miscaptioned."""

However, people should be wary of these spam text messages, as they are likely connected to malware or theft scams. :In March 2022, screenshots supposedly showing text messages from a redheaded woman were circulated on social media attached to the claim that these messages were related to a sex trafficking ring. Posts on social media also warned that if people responded to these messages the sender would be able to track their location.Here's a text from one post that has racked up more than 30,000 shares:!!SEX TRAFFICKING WARNING!!there is a sex trafficking text going around a couple states close by. it's a pic of a red headed girl acting like she's trying to get a hold of a guy she went on a date with, then if you reply to her being nice simply saying ""you have the wrong number."" they can track your location. i got a text friday and didn't think anything about and thought it was just a joke or something and she sent me a nude and then messages that i could tell were already pre written out and then i deleted the texts. and i opened facebook just a little bit ago and seen a post of people having similar issues with the same picture. these people are changing their area code and using different phone number based off of where you live. they used 336 for mine, and 865 on a lady fromtennessee. i turned off all of my locations on all of my apps. PLEASE DO NOT TEXT THIS NUMBER BACK. there is also a blonde headed girl going around doing the same and it's believed to be sex trafficking scam!!!!*update* they are changing the area code based off of the area code affiliated with your phone number !!:A viral TikTok video about a slightly different version of this rumor received more than 2.7 million views on TikTok.:Similar versions of this rumor featuring photographs of different women have been circulating for years. You can see some visual examples of the various versions of this rumor at the top of this article. While people were truly receiving text messages purporting to be from a redheaded woman who dialed the wrong number, and while recipients truly are best off ignoring, blocking, and deleting these messages, there's no evidence that these messages are connected to a sex trafficking ring, nor is there any indication that a person's location will be tracked if they engage with this message. These text messages are just the latest iteration in a series of fear-mongering rumors about sex trafficking that have been circulating on social media for years. While sex trafficking is certainly a real world problem, many of the rumors that get passed around social media about the various tactics sex traffickers are supposedly using to find victims are unfounded. We've previously encountered false rumors about sex traffickers leaving chemically tainted roses on cars, putting zip-ties on mailboxes to mark the location of victims, and posing as door-to-door booksellers.:Ron Pierce, president of the IT company Trinity Solutions, told the North Carolina CBS news affiliate WFMY:""It's a spam text message ... It's kind of one of those social myths, it gets circulated every now and then. This one has been going around since at least 2020, and maybe even a little before. Then it used to be just the whole sex trafficking angle, but now it's, 'watch out, they could track you.' It's a lie, they can't track you by responding to the text or clicking anything like that.""While there's no evidence that the person(s) sending these text messages are linked to a sex trafficking ring, they are likely engaged in another nefarious activity: theft. The goal of many spam text messages is to get a person to divulge personal information, such as a credit card number, birth date, or personal photos, or to click on links containing malware that can steal this information. In the case above, it appears that the scammer was using flirty text messages (and eventually nude photos) in order to get people to click on a link to an adult website that was likely infested with malware.:While these text messages are not linked to sex-trafficking, and receiving one will not allow anyone to track your location, if you get one of these text messages, your best option is to ignore, delete, and mark the number as spam. It's also worth mentioning that while the people on social media warning others about a new sex trafficking scheme are probably doing so with good intentions, these warnings can distract from real sex-trafficking issues and divert resources from people who truly need help. In 2020, after a conspiracy theory that the furniture store Wayfair was trafficking children in overpriced cabinets went viral, the Polaris Project, a nonprofit nongovernmental organization working to combat sex trafficking, published an article explaining how these conspiratorial rumors can impact survivors and victims:A barrage of conspiracy-related reports from people with no direct knowledge of trafficking situations can overwhelm services meant for victims.There are only so many Hotline Advocates available at any one time to handle incoming contacts to the Trafficking Hotline. Hundreds or thousands of people sharing the same information means long wait times for victims in crisis or service providers trying to find immediate help for someone in need. These long waits may literally mean the difference between someone finding the help they need to escape or having to hang up because they can't get through.Survivors, victims, or even accidental bystanders may lose their privacy or be negatively impacted.The Wayfair theory has already resulted in online harassment and privacy intrusions of people mistakenly believed to be victims, as well as broad sharing of online sexual abuse material of actual victims who have not been connected in any way to Wayfair.

Read our special coverage, contribute to support our mission, and submit any tips or claims you see here.Early in the morning on June 9, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump tuned in to the conspiracy-theory-promoting One America News Network (OANN). The message the president evidently took from this early morning TV session was that the 75-year-old man violently pushed to the ground by Buffalo Emergency Response Team officers during a protest in Niagara Square was actually an ""ANTIFA provocateur"" whom the police were justified in pushing because he was ""appearing to scan police communications in order to black out the equipment."":Rumors of ""antifa"" inciting violence during these protests, an assertion originating with a fake tweet by the white nationalist group Identity Evropa, have continued to stew in right-wing circles, despite a marked lack of evidence for the narrative.In their segment on Martin Gugino, OANN used as their source an article from the website Conservative Treehouse (CTH), which was authored by someone who goes by the name ""sundance."" That article makes two primary assertions that OANN later broadcast to the president:""Martin Gugino is a 75-year-old professional agitator and Antifa provocateur... On Friday Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown admitted Gugino was a professional 'agitator' who tried to work up the crowd and had been asked to leave the area 'numerous' times.""""During his effort Gugino was attempting to capture the radio communications signature of Buffalo police officers.""The claim that Gugino was labeled an ""agitator"" by the mayor of Buffalo -- though repeated ad nauseam in news reports and fact checks -- is demonstrably false. The vague assertion that this man's waving cell phone ""capture[d] the radio communications signature of Buffalo police officers"" is inconsistent with the evidence CTH themselves cited to support that notion.:Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown Did Not 'Admit' Gugino was an 'Agitator'The single shred of purportedly factual evidence that this conspiracy rests on is that Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown ""admitted"" Gugino was an ""agitator"" and ""instigator."" Major media outlets including The Daily Beast, New York Daily News, New York Post, TMZ, and The Hill, as well as the fact-checking website TruthorFiction, each reported as fact that Brown made this comment regarding Gugino.All of these reports are based on an incorrect local news account of a press conference held on June 5. As is clear from the transcript of the press conference, this reporting erroneously conflated the mayor's comments regarding two separate instances of police force. The words ""agitator"" and ""instigator"" were used in reference to Myles Carter, who was protesting earlier in the week at a different location on Bailey Avenue and was tackled from behind by New York State police. The mayor's use of the these words clearly refers to the Carter incident, not Gugino (emphasis ours)::Reporter: This [the Martin Gugino incident] wasn't the only incident that happened this week. Monday night, Myles Carter was on Bailey Avenue protesting. He was 15, 20 yards away from a police line with his back and hands up to the police, out of nowhere seemingly they rushed him, arrested him and charged him with two misdemeanors. ... Why not the response Monday night, looking at the officers, temporarily suspending them and having an internal investigation there? I mean, the tape was pretty clear. He wasn't doing anything.Mayor:  Those were state police officers. Those were not Buffalo police officers. So obviously the city of Buffalo does not have the ability to take action against state police officers. But what we were informed of is that that individual was an agitator. He was trying to spark up the crowd of people, again, that was a curfew violation. [...]  And according to what has been reported to me, that individual was a key and major instigator of people engaging in those kinds of activities.Some outlets, such as The Daily Beast and The Hill, have issued corrections. ""This article previously claimed Mayor Brown referred to 75-year-old activist Martin Gugino as a 'major instigator,' but upon review of audio from the press conference, it is clear he was referring to a separate incident,"" wrote The Daily Beast. Unfortunately, these corrections have done little to stem the flow of false information surrounding the incident.:Gugino does have a history of activism -- he was described by the Buffalo News as ""a longtime peace activist."" None of the organizations he has worked with can credibly be considered a part of the purported ""antifa"" movement, which is not a single organization but is instead a decentralized movement opposed to fascism that has endorsed violence as a political tactic. Gugino has been an activist for decades through his work with ""People United for Sustainable Housing Buffalo"" and ""The Western New York Peace Center."" There is no evidence these organizations are secretly part of ""antifa,"" whatever that would mean in practice.According to the Buffalo News, ""Gugino has been involved in a broad array of issues ranging from nuclear disarmament to climate change and Guantanamo."" Gugino's attorney, Kelly Zarcone, told The Associated Press that Gugino ""has always been a peaceful protester because he cares about today's society.""""No one from law enforcement has even suggested anything otherwise, so we are at a loss to understand why the president of the United States would make such dark, dangerous, and untrue accusations about him. We can confirm that those accusations are utterly baseless and ridiculous,"" Zarcone said.:The only evidence that Gugino's attendance at the Niagara Square rally on June 5 was anything other than peaceful comes from falsely attributing Brown's comments about Myles Carter to Gugino. Stripped of that falsehood, the sole remaining truth is that a 75-year-old, lifelong peace activist approached officers vaguely waving his phone before being knocked headfirst to the pavement where he lay unconscious with blood pooling out of his ear.'Scanning Police Communications To Black Out Equipment' Makes No SenseThe assertion breathlessly promoted by OANN, and later Trump himself -- that Gugino's intent in approaching the officers pushed him was to manipulate, steal, or disarm police communications in some way -- comes from the fringe right-wing website ""Conservative Treehouse"" (CTH). OANN cited this website in the report Trump apparently watched. That article stated, with no evidence or exposition, that ""during his effort Gugino was attempting to capture the radio communications signature of Buffalo police officers."" The website presented ""a new video"" which they said confirmed their suspicions. This was not a new video, but instead merely a slower version of the original video that sparked international outrage.:CTH's analysis of this ""new"" slowed-down video is -- to put it mildly -- extremely vague. So vague, in fact, that it fails to present a single coherent hypothesis or claim. Among the possibilities proffered was the claim Trump went with in his tweet -- that Gugino was trying to ""black out"" the network. But other claims proffered by CTH also included attempting to track officers with their cell phones, unlocking encrypted networks, and messing with officers' potentially Bluetooth enabled devices -- each a wholly different hypothesis. The video cannot distinguish between these various hypotheses in part because the video can't actually tell us anything about what he was doing with his phone.One thing the video can tell us, though, is what he was not doing. What he was not doing was attempting to capture radio signals from the police's communication system. In fact, the evidence that CTH themselves used to suggest he was performing some sort of action like that entirely undercuts their argument. Two ""sources"" were cited in support of the notion that radio frequency harvesting was what was going on: a thread apparently authored by the same person who wrote the CTH article, and an article from the website Electronics4u which describes how to receive radio signals on a mobile phone::The capture of communications signals [explained in detail here] is a method of police tracking used by Antifa to monitor the location of police. In some cases the more high tech capture software can even decipher communication encryption allowing the professional agitators to block (black-out), jam, or interfere with police communication. In addition, many police body-cams are bluetooth enabled which allows syncing.The link that allegedly explains ""the more high tech"" way to decipher signals and how to ""block, jam, or interfere"" with police communications hyperlinks to the Electronis4u story, titled ""Software-Defined Radio with Android Smartphones."" Not only does this article make no mention of any blocking, jamming, or interference, it makes explicit the necessity of additional receiver hardware if one wanted to use a phone to do anything involving tuning into radio frequencies. (This appears to be the case for iPhones as well). Here is the setup that article highlighted, which shows the need for both an antenna and a dongle adapter to scan for frequencies::In other words, based solely on the evidence provided by Conservative Treehouse, performing any task requiring knowledge of specific radio frequencies (including cloning or interference), would require hardware connected to the phone. The video, thanks to CTH's cutting edge slow motion analysis, makes clear that he had no such dongle or antenna connected to the phone::We reached out to the Buffalo Police Department for clarification on their communication system and whether they were aware of any possible vulnerabilities that could arise from a cell phone waved in proximity to the officers. At the time of this reporting, we have not received a response.Speaking to The Associated Press, Matt Blaze, a professor of computer science and law at Georgetown University, said the president's tweet regarding ""blacking out"" communication is ""so technically incomprehensible, I'm not even sure where to start.""  As the Post reported, ""It is possible to disrupt police radio -- an illegal action often called ""jamming"" -- but hackers can only do that by attacking receiving stations, not with handheld devices that target an individual police officer's radio, Blaze said.""Ultimately, the allegation that a 75-year-old activist is actually a highly trained member of antifa capable of infiltrating an encrypted police communication network by waving his cell phone around is belied by the fact that his phone did not appear to have the equipment necessary to perform some of the actions he is accused of. It is also belied by a lack of any other corroborating evidence, as well as the inability for its adherents to articulate a concrete allegation. The only bit of additional evidence these claims rely on is the false assertion that the mayor of Buffalo stated Guginio was an ""agitator"" or an ""instigator."":Unfortunately for CTH's embarrassingly under-theorized claim, the mayor of Buffalo never described Gugino this way.

488,488,49.ConspiracyHoaxerSide,"A Texas man who made videos of himself and his girlfriend stalking and harassing victims of the November 2017 Sutherland Springs church shooting has been arrested on one count of being a convicted felon in possession of a weapon.Robert Ussery, 54, of Lockhart, Texas, who goes by the screen name ""Side Thorn,"" was arrested at his home on 23 May 2018 by local, state and federal authorities, including the Wilson County Sheriff's Office, Texas Rangers and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Ussery filmed himself hiding a semi-automatic pistol under the floorboard of his car and telling his sidekick girlfriend, Jodi ""Conspiracy Granny"" Mann, to take responsibility for it.According to the criminal complaint, Ussery is a convicted felon and is aware that as such he is prohibited from owning a firearm.Ussery and Mann were initially arrested on 5 March 2018 for trespassing on the property of First Baptist Church in the tiny town of Sutherland Springs, which was the site of a massacre in which 26 people were killed. According to the criminal complaint they confronted pastor Frank Pomeroy and accused him of perpetuating the shooting ""hoax."" They also told Pomeroy that he was lying about his 14-year-old daughter Annabelle -- who died in the shooting -- saying the girl never existed. Ussery then ""aggressively escalated the situation"" by yelling at Pomeroy that ""the people"" would hang him by the neck. Ussery said he would then urinate on Pomeroy.:By happenstance, a Vice camera crew had accompanied the hoaxers on their trip to the massacre site to film footage for their April 2018 documentary, ""The Rise of the Crisis Actor Conspiracy Movement."" They captured the confrontation along with Ussery and Mann's arrest:Ussery and Mann filmed the entire incident on Go-Pro cameras and captured Ussery placing a black and silver semiautomatic striker-fire pistol under the floor mat of the driver's seat of their pickup truck. The two are then heard having a conversation in which Ussery tells Mann where the gun is, and adds that it was hers. Wilson County Sheriff's deputies accessed the video with a search warrant after the couple's initial arrest, which provided the basis for Ussery's later arrest.Sherri Pomeroy, Frank Pomeroy's wife, told us by phone that she felt a great sense of relief to learn Ussery was in custody again, telling us, ""You don't realize what a toll that takes on you, looking over your shoulder all the time."" Pomeroy said neither she nor her husband knew Ussery was armed during the confrontation.:C.W. Wade, a researcher and journalist with HONR Network, an advocacy group that acts on behalf of families and victims of high profile crimes to shield them from hoaxer harassment, has been tracking Side Thorn and Conspiracy Granny for years and told us he has long believed Ussery to be a danger to the public:No doubt he poses a vey real threat to the public, just based on his own statement when he went to Sutherland Springs. He blatantly tells you he's coming to kill you, he's coming to hang you. I think it's very fair to take him at face value that when he says he wants to kill you, that's what he intends to do.When you start telling someone who lost their kid, 'I'm gonna hang you, show me the death certificate"" -- when you say that to a person straight to their face, that is a very high level of cruelty.Wade told us Ussery has threatened him on more than one occasion. He showed us archives of social media posts Ussery wrote, in which he makes threatening comments or discusses potentially illegal activities like exhuming graves of mass shooting victims to prove they are not real. In one post, Ussery writes under the image of a police officer that first responders will ""hang"" unless they ""join the people telling the truth."":Wade said Side Thorn and Conspiracy Granny are part of a network of ""hoaxers,"" or people who believe mass shootings and other high-casualty tragedies are ""false flags"" perpetrated by the government to form a pretext for seizing people's firearms and ushering in a repressive global autocracy. Hoaxers latch onto events like the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary school shooting or the 2018 shooting in Parkland, Florida, claiming that victims, witnesses, and loved ones are ""crisis actors"" and that the events are staged.Those spreading false information or hoaxer conspiracies in the wakes of mass casualty incidents have been facing real-world consequences in recent months. The parents of two children killed in the Sandy Hook tragedy are suing conspiracy troll Alex Jones of InfoWars for $1 million in damages. Other troll sites like GotNews.com and GatewayPundit.com have also been sued for defamation after naming an innocent person as the man who drove a car into a crowd of counter-protesters at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing a woman and injuring several others, some severely.Ussery is currently in the custody of the U.S. Marshal Service, and was scheduled to make an initial court appearance on 24 May 2018. If convicted, he faces up to ten years in federal prison.:"

According to the article, the panel of judges examined evidence pertaining to allegations that the Obama administration illegally ""wiretapped"" Donald Trump's presidential campaign::A panel of 16 judges convened yesterday to process the information available to Attorney General Barr and their conclusion was unanimous: There is plenty of evidence to indict Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for Conspiracy to Create a False Conspiracy, a 2nd-degree felony with a 10-year mandatory minimum.The judges all agreed that the initial dossier narrative used to obtain a wiretap of the Trump campaign was most likely bogus and that the conclusions inferred from any evidence gathered from them is, therefore, fruit of the poisonous tree and not admissible in court.The Trump Administration was quick to issue a statement through Director of Information and Propaganda, Art Tubolls:""We are as pleased as ever that we are once again shown to have never done anything outside the law -- ever. At this point, President Trump is innocent of so many things it will be difficult to justify how he couyld [sic] possibly be guilty of anything.""Readers who clicked through to the website expecting to find something resembling an actual news report were disappointed, of course. No crime exists of ""conspiracy to commit a false conspiracy,"" and the Trump administration has no ""Director of Information and Propaganda.""

491,491,651.RememberingAviatorAm,"Aviator Amelia Earhart was born on July 24, 1897 and in 1932, she became the first woman to pilot a plane across the Atlantic ocean. On July 1937, however, Earhart achieved fame for an unfortunate reason.Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan disappeared in theirLockheed Electra plane, while attempting a global flight. Despite extensive efforts to find them, they were never found, nor was any wreckage from their plane. Earhart was officially declared dead in 1939.Despite disappearing more than eight decades ago, Earhart has remained a pop culture fixture. She has also remained the focal point of conspiracy theories, some of them more bizarre than others.Officially, the position of the U.S. has been that Earhart and Noonan ran out of fuel and crashed into the Pacific Ocean while trying to reach tiny Howland Island to land and refuel.:Some believe that Earhart was captured by the Japanese government after landing in the Marshall Islands, with some pointing to a photograph taken in the 1930s that allegedly showed both Earhart and her plane there. In another theory, some speculated she took on the identity of ""Tokyo Rose,"" a propagandist who made English-language broadcasts intended to demoralize Allied forces during World War II. There was no evidence for this narrative.But Ric Gillespie, author of the book ""Finding Amelia"" and executive director of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, told the BBC in 2017 that there is no evidence supporting the claim that a photograph shows Earhart in Japanese custody.Another theory is that Earhart and Noonan successfully landed on Nikumaroro, another tiny island southeast of Howland, but both died there as rescuers failed to find them in time. Per National Geographic, tantalizing clues, including human remains and airplane parts, were discovered on the island by a British exploration party in 1937.:Another unfounded theory was that Earhart survived and returned to the U.S., but assumed a new identity, namely ""Irene Bolham."" This theory, put forward by book author Joe Klaas, was false, as ABC News reported:The theory should have died after Bolham sued Klaas, his associate Joe Gervais, and McGraw-Hill for defamation and McGraw-Hill pulled the book from shelves. But 33 years later, another book, ""Amelia Earhart Survives"" by Col. Rollin Reineck, came out in 2003 making the same claim.Stranger theories about Earhart's disappearance attribute it to an alien abduction and even more bizarre, the idea that she was saved by a race of people that live inside the Earth."

Braverman, an attorney, headed the foundation from 2013 until he resigned that position in 2015.Braverman took to Twitter on 19 January 2017 to announce he had accepted a position with a California-based charity.

Chuck Chai remains President and Chief Investment Officer of the Hillspire investment group. Maria Seferian continues to serve as General Counsel across the Schmidt organization.Eric Schmidt and Wendy Schmidt said: ""Now more than ever, there is important work to be done as we bring the power of both technology and people together into networks that can help address this century's greatest challenges.

We are very pleased to have Eric working closely with us to direct our family office and to lead and continue to innovate in our philanthropic efforts."" Braverman is now a member of the board of each active philanthropic entity, including The Schmidt Ocean Institute and The 11th Hour Project.:Rumors regarding Braverman's whereabouts began swirling after a leaked document published via WikiLeaks showed his name mentioned in e-mails between Clinton staffers who believed he was furtively releasing information about the foundation's financial doings. The only evidence offered, however, was his lack of social media use.Eric Braverman, the Clinton Foundation CEO from 2013 until 2015, has apparently been missing since October. His absence has fueled speculations in the blogosphere but so far has been ignored by the media.Some speculate, with good reason, that Braverman may have gone into hiding after an email mentioning his name was released by Wikileaks on October 22 of this year. In the March 2015 email exchange, Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden told Clinton campaign manager and confidant John Podesta there was a mole within the Clinton Foundation. Podesta in his reply told Tanden the mole was Braverman...The last evidence of Braverman's public activity was October 12, when he posted his last tweet on Twitter. (Usually he tweets about once a month. His ""husband,"" Neil Brown, hasn't tweeted since August, although he rarely tweets.) I left a voicemail on Braverman's personal phone and sent him an email, but received no response. He is still listed as a lecturer at Yale University and, contrary to some reports, there is a record of his lectures going back several years. I contacted the press office and Braverman's department at Yale and received no response.:We found no evidence that Braverman had ever gone missing. Although he has never contacted us directly, we found no evidence he had ever talked on the record to the media. When we called police departments on the East Coast, where he was previously located, we found no evidence he was listed as a ""missing person"" by any law enforcement agency.The conspiracy theory that the Clintons have killed or disappeared numerous people they find politically inconvenient has been swirling for decades, but it reached a new fever pitch during the 2016 presidential election. On 24 October 2016, the conspiracy-mongering web site WhatDoesItMean.com started a false rumor claiming Braverman, an attorney and businessman, had applied for asylum in Russia after his name was revealed in the WikiLeaks dump."

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.QAnon is often viewed as a group associated with conspiracy, terrorism and radical action, such as the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection. But radical extremism and terror may not be the real concern from this group.QAnon followers, who may number in the millions, appear to believe a baseless and debunked conspiracy theory claiming that a satanic cabal of pedophiles and cannibals controls world governments and the media. They also subscribe to many other outlandish and improbable ideas, such as that the Earth is flat, that the coronavirus is a biological weapon used to gain control over the world's population, that Bill Gates is somehow trying to use coronavirus vaccinations to implant microchips into people and more.:As a social psychologist, I normally study terrorists. During research for ""Pastels and Pedophiles: Inside the Mind of QAnon,"" a forthcoming book I co-authored with security scholar Mia Bloom, I noticed that QAnon followers are different from the radicals I usually study in one key way: They are far more likely to have serious mental illnesses.Significant conditionsI found that many QAnon followers revealed - in their own words on social media or in interviews - a wide range of mental health diagnoses, including bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety and addiction.In court records of QAnon followers arrested in the wake of the Capitol insurrection, 68% reported they had received mental health diagnoses. The conditions they revealed included post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, paranoid schizophrenia and Munchausen syndrome by proxy - a psychological disorder that causes one to invent or inflict health problems on a loved one, usually a child, in order to gain attention for themselves. By contrast, 19% of all Americans have a mental health diagnosis. :Among QAnon insurrectionists with criminal records, 44% experienced a serious psychological trauma that preceded their radicalization, such as physical or sexual abuse of them or of their children. The psychology of conspiracyResearch has long revealed connections between psychological problems and beliefs in conspiracy theories. For example, anxiety increases conspiratorial thinking, as do social isolation and loneliness. Depressed, narcissistic and emotionally detached people are also prone to have a conspiratorial mindset. Likewise, people who exhibit odd, eccentric, suspicious and paranoid behavior - and who are manipulative, irresponsible and low on empathy - are more likely to believe conspiracy theories.QAnon's rise has coincided with an unfolding mental health crisis in the United States. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of diagnoses of mental illness was growing, with 1.5 million more people diagnosed in 2019 than in 2018.:The isolation of the lockdowns, compounded by the anxiety related to COVID and the economic uncertainty, made a bad situation worse. Self-reported anxiety and depression quadrupled during the quarantine and now affects as much as 40% of the U.S. population.:Supporters of President Donald Trump hold up their phones with messages referring to the QAnon conspiracy theory at a campaign rally at the Las Vegas Convention Center on Feb. 21, 2020.Mario Tama/Getty ImagesA more serious problemIt's possible that people who embrace QAnon ideas may be inadvertently or indirectly expressing deeper psychological problems. This could be similar to when people exhibit self-harming behavior or psychosomatic complaints that are in fact signals of serious psychological issues.It could be that QAnon is less a problem of terrorism and extremism than it is one of poor mental health.Only a few dozen QAnon followers are accused of having done anything illegal or violent - which means that for millions of QAnon believers, their radicalization may be of their opinions, but not their actions.:In my view, the solution to this aspect of the QAnon problem is to address the mental health needs of all Americans - including those whose problems manifest as QAnon beliefs.

MSM was so busy accusing Russian hackers to take notice. pic.twitter.com/0XVezTyfHM-- Russian Embassy, UK (@RussianEmbassy) May 19, 2017:Russia has a vested interest in distracting attention away from the investigation into whether members of President Donald Trump's campaign colluded with the Kremlin, and the Seth Rich story provided an opportunity to do so. Clint Watts, a former Federal Bureau of Investigation counterterrorism agent and fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute told us:There are several facets to this -- [Russian agents] want to push back on the idea, particularly among Trump supporters, that they hacked into the DNC. The way to do that is to put forward this Seth Rich scenario that the information didn't come form Russian hackers, it came from an [inside] leak.It rallies Trump's base, which they have already influenced significantly over the last two years in the U.S. and foments conspiracy theories. And it mirrors what Trump says. Trump denies the findings of the intelligence agencies that Russia did hack into the DNC. [Russian agents] want that to go away as much as possible.The fact the investigation has yielded such a high-profile scandal means that the election hack appears in that respect to have backfired, making it seem unlikely that Russian President Vladimir Putin will achieve any of his foreign policy ambitions vis-a-vis the United States. What remains unclear is whether they will pay a price for it. :When asked by Rep. Terri Sewell (D-Alabama) during a House Intelligence Committee hearing on 23 May 2017 whether the current U.S. administration was doing enough to punish Russia for its election interference, former Central Intelligence Agency director John Brennan said he didn't know what may be going on behind the scenes because he left the Agency with the outgoing Obama administration in January 2017. But Brennan did say the disinformation campaigns continue even though the election is over:The Russians are watching very carefully right now what is going on in Washington, and they will try to exploit it for their own purposes and to see whether or not they can further seed partisan animosity here in Washington and try to roil the waters, the political waters here. So even though the election is over, I think Mr. Putin and Russian intelligence services are trying to actively exploit what is going on now in Washington to their benefit and to our detriment.Andrew Weisburd, senior fellow at the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security at George Washington University, was more blunt. ""Until the West gets truly serious about inflicting pain on the Kremlin this will continue,"" he told us.:The Seth Rich controversy makes it clear the meddling isn't going away. Aside from the Russian embassy in London weighing in, the usual suspects fired up the Internet after the Fox story was published on 16 May 2017 and started promoting specious information about Rich's murder. Kremlin-funded outlets, including RT (formerly Russia Today) and Sputnik News, posted conspiratorial stories about the Rich murder for American audience consumption, while high-profile pundits like Sean Hannity and Newt Gingrich pushed them even after they had been debunked. The story was also shared across widely-read web sites like Breitbart.com and InfoWars and boosted by a hacker who uses the moniker Kim Dotcom. And as usual, it was all amplified on Twitter.Watts told us:You know it's successful, because you hear people in Congress considering the conspiracy or floating it themselves. That's the gold standard of an influence operation, is when your target audience starts repeating the conspiracy.:These activities are known to intelligence experts as ""active measures"" -- an old Russian tactic of using overt, semi-covert and covert tools to spread disinformation, gin up confusion, and exacerbate partisan divides to weaken their Western adversaries from the inside. ""The Russians want fact and fiction to be blurred,"" Watts said.Russian active measures or influence campaigns in the U.S. are not new, but they have kicked it into high gear in recent years. Watts said he began noticing this in 2014, with the spread of fake stories about an attack on an air base in Incirlik, Turkey (there was no attack). Now, they're enabled by the anonymity and volume offered by social media alongside the ability to force a topic into the mainstream with the ""trending"" capability offered by sites like Twitter and Facebook. Where Americans used to get their news from mostly-reliable sources like newspapers and only a few news broadcasters that followed a set standard of ethics, balance, and vetting, they are now faced with an information void and an environment in which their friends and family -- people they trust -- are sharing bad information (or misinformation) on social media.:On this topic, John Brennan testified:Mr. Putin and Russian intelligence services are determined to do what they can to influence in a very inappropriate and illegal way activities within Western democracies to undermine the Western-led liberal democratic order. They do that on a regular basis, they see Western democracies as a threat to them. And so that's why the cyber domain right now is a growing playground for Russian activities and they will use that and exploit it whatever way they can. So they've been involved in elections for many years including trying to influence the ones here in the United States with propaganda or whatever. But this cyber environment now provides new opportunities to collect, to collect and release, to influence, and they are increasingly adept at it.Seth Rich was shot and killed on 10 July 2016 near his home in Washington, D.C. in what Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) investigators believe to have been a botched robbery, due to a string of similar crimes in his neighborhood at that time. In an e-mail, MPD confirmed that is still the suspected motive:At this point in the investigation, it is believed that Seth Rich was the victim of an attempted robbery.  MPD does not currently have evidence to suggest otherwise; should anyone be in possession of such evidence, they are urged to turn it over to the police.:There is no evidence to date that thousands of e-mails were found on Rich's computer linking him to WikiLeaks, or that he was killed as part of a conspiracy or coverup."
495,495,205.NoChinaIsntAmassingT,"Claim:Thousands of Chinese military troops are massing in Canada, preparing to invade the U.S.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In the fall of 2020, various social media users shared a right-wing hoax claiming that China had amassed troops in Canada in preparation to invade the U.S. The conspiracy theory appears to have originated with Hal Turner, a white supremacist radio personality and blogger.:Turner's post carries the incendiary headline, ""Arm Yourselves and Prepare; China Massing 'Tens-of-Thousands' of Troops in Prince Rupert and Vancouver Canada. Invade USA?"" The claim has been circulating on various platforms, with some sharing a brief YouTube video as ""proof."" In the video, a man in a car claims to be driving by Chinese troops gathering on a road in Salt Spring Island, Vancouver. But if you actually watch the video, all you see are people wearing green fatigues casually walking in loose formation. There's no evidence the people are ""Chinese military,"" as the man narrating the video states.In an email to Snopes, a spokesperson for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canada's national police force, said they have ""no awareness"" of China amassing troops on Canadian soil.Turner's post claims that the troop placement was enabled by ""the globalist/Commie Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau"" who in 2019 signed the Foreign Investment Protection Act with China allowing Chinese security forces to be stationed in Canada ""without the knowledge or consent of local authorities."" This is a mischaracterization of the agreement between China and Canada.:The agreement was not signed by Trudeau, but by his predecessor, Stephen Harper. It went into effect in 2014 -- a year before Trudeau took office -- and there is no mention in the agreement of Chinese troop placement on Canadian soil."
496,496,419.WasCesarSayocsVanSta,"Claim:A van belonging to the suspect arrested in the October 2018 series of mail bombings was created as part of a ""false flag"" plot.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 26 October 2018, a 56-year-old Florida resident named Cesar Sayoc was arrested on suspicion of having mailed a series of explosive devices to Democratic officials and other critics of President Trump over the previous several days.  :A post-arrest look into Sayoc's background quickly revealed that he appeared to be an ardent supporter of President Donald Trump, having attended at least two Trump rallies in Florida and driving a van whose windows were festooned with pro-Trump stickers::Even before Sayoc's arrest, Trump supporters and assorted conspiracy buffs had already been pushing a theory that the mail bombs ""were not actually part of a plot to harm Democrats, but were a 'false flag' operation concocted by leftists in order to paint conservatives as violent radicals ahead of the [midterm] elections"":A range of high-profile conservatives have embraced a conspiracy theory that mail bombs sent to liberal public figures are a ""false flag"" attack by leftwingers. Many have also claimed that the attacks are intended to elicit sympathy for Democrats ahead of the looming midterm elections.Authorities are yet to identify a suspect or motive in the bombings, which have seen 12 pipe bombs sent to a range of figures from former president Barack Obama to Bill and Hillary Clinton to financier George Soros and even to the out-spoken actor Robert De Niro. All the suspects have one thing in common: they have been targets of Donald Trump's ire.Nevertheless, without evidence, a number of ostensibly mainstream conservatives joined more overtly conspiracist outlets in either expressing skepticism that conservatives would damage their own cause, or making outright accusations that the left are orchestrating the bombing campaign in order to sabotage Republicans.:Not dissuaded by the evidence when a suspect was finally taken into custody, the conspiracy theorists quickly disclaimed evidence such as Sayoc's van, maintaining that it was too obviously ""staged""::The ""staged van"" claim had a fatal flaw to it, though: south Florida residents had been spotting and photographing Sayoc's unusual van with its collection of pro-Trump stickers for up to a year before his arrest.  The Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel, for example, reported on the many locals who had observed Sayoc and his prominent vehicle around town long before the wave of mail bombings and his subsequent arrest:From Aventura to Hollywood to Davie and farther, people have gawked and photographed the oddball vehicle for some time.""I saw this van dozens of times. It always struck me, always unsettled me. It appeared that somebody at times was in the van, though it was hard to tell because of the windows,"" said David Cypkin, a documentary film producer who co-produced 2006's ""Cocaine Cowboys.""""This is also Miami and you don't know -- this guy's an enthusiastic Trump supporter, that's one thing, but the number of stickers he had on his car combined with some of the more threatening stickers seemed to indicate this might be a person with a problem you don't want to confront directly, especially in Miami, where you don't know if anybody's armed."":Cypkin encountered the van regularly when he lived near the Shoppes at the Waterways in Aventura, where it was regularly parked. Cypkin believed someone could be living in the van, and finally, on the morning of New Year's Eve 2017, he snapped a few quick pictures so he could get a better look at some of the stickers later.""I had seen it there at least a year,"" Cypkin said. ""I did see someone standing at the back one time, with one of the back doors open. I didn't make eye contact.""In Davie, people frequently saw the van outside Whole Foods, and Geo Rodriguez, a former South Florida Sun Sentinel reporter, came across it in front of Papa John's pizza in Hollywood.On April 6, he stepped outside a 7-11 and saw the van, parked on the swale next to Hollywood Boulevard, in front of the Papa John's. Several readers said they have seen the van delivering pizza.I've seen him off and on. You can tell he's from around here,"" Rodriguez said. ""I see him at the Publix here in Hollywood all the time. He's kind of like a fixture."":In fact, as exemplified by the following Vice article excerpt, some commenters began debating after Sayoc's arrest whether his van shouldn't have been called to the attention of law enforcement authorities well before he allegedly began sending explosive devices through the mail:After media outlets broadcast images of Sayoc's ride being impounded by FBI agents, Miami locals began posting photos of the van taken as far back as last winter ...But even as the inflammatory rhetoric on the windows of Sayoc's van attracted the curiosity of nervous onlookers, conversations with federal law enforcement and free speech experts suggested the decals and the messaging alone likely did not represent actionable criminal conduct. In other words, despite hate crimes being on the rise and the majority of extremist violence being carried out by right-wing white supremacists, a violence-adorned MAGA van is almost certainly just that: a vehicle some Americans might find objectionable.""You can't do anything about the stickers and the decals,"" Chris Quick, a former FBI joint terrorism task force agent, told me. ""That is free speech. It doesn't matter if it was one or 20 stickers."":None of this is likely to dissuade the faithful, however, as conspiracy theorists tend to pick and choose their evidence while ignoring substantive proof that contradicts their claims.  In this case, any conspiracy adherent would have to believe the far-fetched notion that Sayoc was engaged to attend Republican political rallies and drive (and possibly live in) in a van prominently marked with political stickers for a year or more in order to set up a ""false flag"" plot that wouldn't play out until long afterwards.  "
497,497,514.Isthe2020ElectionFar,"Claim:As of mid-November 2020, the U.S. presidential election remained ""far from over,"" thus enough uncertainty about the outcome remained that U.S. President Donald Trump could reasonably claim he might still be the winner.Rating:MixtureAbout this rating What's TrueAlthough the results of modern U.S. presidential elections are typically called by the news media on Election Day (or soon after) based on vote tallies reported in real time by local election officials nationwide, said elections are technically unfinished until the Electoral College casts its votes in December and Congress certifies that count in January. What's FalseHowever, it's a misinterpretation of the U.S. Constitution, as well as federal statutes and state laws governing national elections, to regard those post-Election Day procedures -- steps that officially cement Americans' pick for president -- as an opportunity to defy the will of the voters without providing compelling evidence of error or fraud.:Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.In mid-November 2020, after all major news organizations declared former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden the winner of the presidential election, President Donald Trump's campaign claimed in a series of fundraising emails that the election was ""far from over,"" and that supporters should not believe messages to the contrary. (Read more fact checks like this one here.)In other words, the emails claimed either Biden or Trump could serve as the country's 46th president come Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, 2021 -- even though Biden won key battleground states, including Michigan and Pennsylvania, by comfortable vote margins and exceeded the 270 Electoral College votes required to win the presidency.:The emails -- like the president's tweets that falsely claimed he had won or denied Biden's victory -- were part of an aggressive disinformation campaign attempting to attack the integrity of America's democratic process and convince supporters that Trump had a significant chance to serve another term.""Joe Biden only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING. We have a long way to go -- this was a flawed ELECTION,"" said a Nov. 19 campaign email obtained by Snopes.:To unpack the underlying claim -- that American elections provide losing candidates an opportunity to defy the outcome of the popular vote -- let's first lay out the country's steps for presidential elections under the Constitution, federal statutes, and state laws.Every four years, when Americans cast ballots in presidential elections, they are participating in the country's popular vote.That happened Nov. 3 in the Trump-Biden race. Days later on Nov. 7, Biden was announced the winner of the popular vote based on the number of votes counted so far compared to the margin of votes between him and Trump in key battleground states. (Read why and how journalists make that determination in presidential races here.)Typically, at that point in an election, the losing candidate acknowledges defeat by conceding to his opponent and addressing supporters in a speech. But Trump not only did not do that, he and his allies went a step further by spewing the unfounded conspiracy theory that any person or group who acknowledged  Biden's victory was working to undermine the president.:Whether a candidate accepts the outcome of the popular vote or not, state officials at polling sites nationwide continue to count remaining ballots over the course of days or weeks, according to their respective rules.That process, which historically is a procedural step to cement the outcome of the popular vote, requires governors to prepare what's called a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" that lists their state's slate of electors. For example, Biden won the popular vote in Minnesota, so that's state's certificate would list 10 Democratic electors who pledged to vote for Biden through the Electoral College.Likewise, if, hypothetically, Trump had won the Midwestern state, the state's certificate would list a different group of 10 people -- electors who pledged to vote for the Republican candidate.All of this said, electors meet at state capitals in early December, weeks after Election Day, to formally cast votes for president and vice president, per guidelines outlined in the Constitution.:No constitutional provision, nor any federal law, requires electors to vote according to the results of the popular vote; however, the majority of states and the District of Columbia have their own laws governing the Electoral College and aim to keep electors from defying the popular vote.Here are specific deadlines for those above-described steps in presidential elections, per The Associated Press:Dec. 8 is the deadline for resolving election disputes at the state level. All state recounts and court contests over presidential election results are to be completed by this date.Dec. 14: Electors vote by paper ballot in their respective states and the District of Columbia. Thirty-three states and D.C. have laws or party regulations requiring electors to vote the same way the popular vote goes in the state, and in some states, electors can even be replaced or subjected to penalties, according to the Congressional Research Service.Dec. 23: The certificates must be delivered to the designated officials. If they are not delivered, the law provides alternative avenues for getting the results to Washington.Jan. 6, 2021: The House and Senate hold a joint session to count the electoral votes. If one ticket has received 270 or more electoral votes, the president of the Senate, currently Vice President Mike Pence, announces the results.:So, in short, a presidential election doesn't end on Election Day, nor when a candidate is projected the winner by news media. Rather, presidential elections officially conclude the following year, in January.But it's a false interpretation of state and federal laws governing presidential elections to consider those continuing steps after polls close on Election Day -- when states certify results or choose electors, or the Electoral College votes for president -- as opportunities to defy the popular vote.Per analysis of the guidelines by constitutional experts and election academics, the post-election day procedures mainly serve to cement what voters decided at the county and state level.We should note here: The emails from Trump's campaign alleging the election was ""far from over"" asked supporters to chip in to a so-called ""Official Election Defense Fund"" or ""Election Defense Task Force,"" both of which the campaign framed as costly initiatives involving ballot recounts or various lawsuits to challenge Biden's win.:But according to Brendan Fischer, director of the federal reform program at Campaign Legal Center, the average donor's money was not covering those expenses. ""Small donors who give to Trump thinking they are financing an 'official election defense fund' are in fact helping pay down the Trump campaign's debt or funding his post-presidential political operation,"" Fischer tweeted.In sum, it was accurate to claim the 2020 presidential election was incomplete as of mid-November. However, it was false to categorize the remaining procedures as reasonable opportunities for Trump to overturn Biden's victory. For those reasons, we rate this claim ""Mostly False."""

Rating:FalseAbout this rating On June 22, 2023, the U.S. Coast Guard announced that a submersible craft en route to the site of the Titanic had likely been lost in a catastrophic implosion, killing all aboard. The craft, Titan, was operated by the group OceanGate, which takes tourists and experts to the decaying shipwreck. The craft had taken three trips to the site previously. :Five passengers were aboard: OceanGate founder and submersible pilot Stockton Rush, Titanic expert Paul-Henry Nargeolet, billionaire businessman and Guinness World Record holder for ""longest duration at full ocean depth by a crewed vessel"" Hamish Harding, and a father-and-son duo, Shahzada and Suleman Dawood, who were members of one of Pakistan's ""most prominent families"" who joined the expedition as tourists.Following news that the Titan was lost, conspiracy theories about Shazada Dawood's connection to the World Economic Forum (WEF), an influential international organization fostering private-public partnerships that is the source of myriad conspiracy theories, started circulating online. Specifically, there was a claim that Shazada Dawood was vice chairman of the WEF.White Hats?Don't exist apparently.Hmmmm OkayMust be a coincidence then that the Father of the Father/ Son duo trapped on the Lost Submarine visiting Titanic.......Is the Vice Chairman of a little Organisation known as......The World Economic Forum https://t.co/DS9CEoJtU8-- The White Rabbit Podcast (@AllBiteNoBark88) June 22, 2023:That claim was false. Shazada Dawood was not the vice chairman of the WEF. He was, instead, the vice chairman of Dawood Hercules Corporation, an agriculture, petrochemicals, and telecommunication infrastructure company based in Karachi, Pakistan. The confusion stemmed, in part, from the fact that Shazada Dawood's biography was on the WEF website. There, he is listed as vice chairman of Dawood Hercules and its subsidiary Engro Corporation, as of this writing::Merely having a biography on the WEF website does not mean a person is a member of the organization. Dawood's biography is not on the webpage listing WEF's leadership. Yan Zopf, a spokesperson for the WEF, told The Associated Press (AP) that Dawood was not the vice chairman or an employee of the organization but ""was a member of the World Economic Forum's Family Business Community and attended some of the events in this capacity.""Additionally, as reported by the AP, ""Pages on the WEF website like the one featuring Dawood are created for any person who has ever attended a WEF event or has written a blog posted on the site.""Because Dawood was vice chairman of Dawood Hercules and not the WEF, the claim is ""False."""

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.What is the cost of propaganda, misinformation and conspiracy theories? Democracy and public safety, to name just two things. The United States has received a stark lesson on how online propaganda and misinformation have an offline impact.For months, Donald Trump has falsely claimed the November presidential election was rigged and that's why he wasn't re-elected. The president's words have mirrored and fed conspriacy theories spread by followers of the QAnon movement. While conspiracy theorists are often dismissed as ""crazy people on social media,"" QAnon adherents were among the individuals at the front line of the storming of Capitol Hill.:QAnon is a decentralized, ideologically motivated and violent extemist movement rooted in an unfounded conspiracy theory that a global ""Deep State"" cabal of satanic pedophile elites is responsible for all the evil in the world. Adherents of QAnon also believe that this same cabal is seeking to bring down Trump, whom they see as the world's only hope in defeating it.The evolution of QAnonThough it started as a series of conspiracy theories and false predictions, over the past three years QAnon has evolved into an extremist religio-political ideology.I've been studying the movement for more than two years. QAnon is what I call a hyper-real religion. QAnon takes popular cultural artifacts and integrates them into an ideological framework. QAnon has been a security threat in the making for the past three years.:The COVID-19 pandemic has played a signficant role in popularizing the QAnon movement. Facebook data since the start of 2020 shows QAnon membership grew by 581 per cent  -- most of which occurred after the United States closed its borders last March as part of its coronavirus containment strategy.Aggregate growth of QAnon membership in Facebook groups and pages between January and September 2020. Data collected and visualized September 4, 2020 courtsey of CrowdTangle.As social media researcher Alex Kaplan noted, 2020 was the year ""QAnon became all of our problem"" as the movement initially gained traction by spreading COVID-related conspiracy theories and disinformation and was then further mainstreamed by 97 U.S. congressional candidates who publicly showed support for QAnon.Crowdsourced answersThe essence of QAnon lies in its attempts to delineate and explain evil. It's about theodicy, not secular evidence. QAnon offers its adherents comfort in an uncertain   -- and unprecedented   -- age as the movement crowdsources answers to the inexplicable.:QAnon becomes the master narrative capable of simply explaining various complex events. The result is a worldview characterized by a sharp distinction between the realms of good and evil that is non-falsifiable.No matter how much evidence journalists, academics and civil society offer as a counter to the claims promoted by the movement, belief in QAnon as the source of truth is a matter of faith   -- specifically in their faith in Trump and ""Q,"" the anonymous person who began the movement in 2017 by posting a series of wild theories about the Deep State. Trump validated theoriesThe year 2020 was also Trump finally gave QAnon what it always wanted: respect. As Travis View, a conspiracy theory researcher and host of the QAnon Anonymous podcast recently wrote: ""Over the past few months  ...Trump has recognized the QAnon community in a way its followers could have only fantasized about when I began tracking the movement's growth over two years ago."":Trump, lawyers Sidney Powell and Lin Wood, and QAnon ""rising star"" Ron Watkins have all been actively inflaming QAnon apocalyptic and anti-establishment desires by promoting voter fraud conspiracy theories.Doubts about the validity of the election have been circulating in far-right as well as QAnon circles. Last October, I wrote that if there were delays or other complications in the final result of the presidential contest, it would likely feed into a pre-existing belief in the invalidity of the election   -- and foster a chaotic environment that could lead to violence.A shirtless man known as the 'QAnon Shaman' was one of the high-profile members of Trump supporters who invaded the U.S. Capitol.(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)Hope for miraclesThe storming of U.S. Capitol saw the culmination of what has been building up for weeks: the ""hopeium"" in QAnon circles that some miracle via Vice-President Mike Pence and other constitutional witchcraft would overturn the election results.:Instead, QAnon followers are now faced with the end of a Trump presidency   -- where they had free rein -- and the fear of what a Biden presidency will bring. We have now long passed the point of simply asking: how can people believe in QAnon when so many of its claims fly in the face of facts? The attack on the Capitol showed the real dangers of QAnon adherents.Their militant and anti-establishment ideology   -- rooted in a quasi-apocalyptic desire to destroy the existing, corrupt world and usher in a promised golden age   -- was on full display for the whole world to see. Who could miss the shirtless man wearing a fur hat, known as the QAnon Shaman, leading the charge into the Capitol rotunda? What will happen now? QAnon, along with other far-right actors, will likely continue to come together to achieve their insurrection goals. This could lead to a continuation of QAnon-inspired violence as the movement's ideology continues to grow in American culture.:Marc-Andre Argentino, PhD candidate Individualized Program, 2020-2021 Public Scholar, Concordia UniversityThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Shortly afterwards, social media users began circulating variants of a conspiracy theory holding that AT&T had been engaged to undertake a ""forensic audit of Dominion voting machines,"" the latter of which were frequent targets of false election fraud claims made by President Donald Trump and his supports after Trump lost his re-election bid in November 2020:::The implication of the conspiracy theory was that the explosion had been intended to destroy the machines before they were audited in order to cover up evidence of massive voting fraud.:However, both AT&T and Dominion have disclaimed the notion that the former company was engaged in audit of the latter, or that any Dominion-related systems were being moved to Nashville in preparation for a ""forensic audit"" (by anyone).  No available external evidence suggests AT&T was involved in any such audit, either.As of now, the person of interest identified by the FBI in connection with the explosion, Anthony Quinn Warner, is believed to have been ""paranoid about 5G technology"" (another frequent subject of conspiracy theories) rather than possessing any election-related motive."
501,501,566.DidaPhysicianConfirm,"Claim:Photos and video clips narrated by a medical doctor demonstrate that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton likely has Parkinson's disease.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Hillary Clinton's health has been the subject of intense speculation during the 2016 presidential campaign, in part because the candidates' fitness to serve is of valid concern to voters, and in part because it was seized upon by her opponents as a way to undermine her candidacy.:While presidential candidates aren't required by law to release information about their medical histories, it has become routine for them to do so, and both Democratic candidate Clinton and Republican candidate Trump have provided physician's statements attesting to their good health. Despite this, rumors to the effect that Clinton is suffering from some kind of serious, undisclosed medical condition continue to run rampant.The statement released by Clinton's personal doctor, Lisa Bardack, MD of Mount Kisco, New York, lists past bouts of deep vein thrombosis (blood clots), an elbow fracture, and a concussion, plus ongoing conditions of hypothyroidism and seasonal pollen allergies. Though her family medical history includes heart disease and stroke, a cardiac screening was conducted in 2015 and came back negative. So did a cancer screening. ""[Clinton] is in excellent physical condition,"" Bardack concluded, ""and fit to serve as President of the United States.""We note that Dr. Bardack's assessment (which she reaffirmed in writing in August 2016) was based on an actual physical examination of the candidate -- not a minor consideration, given that much of the speculation about Clinton's health has been fueled by ""diagnoses"" from afar by physicians who have never shaken her hand, much less conducted a thorough examination of her.: Armchair diagnoses Media personality ""Dr. Drew"" Pinsky, for one, delivered a rambling assessment of Clinton's health on a radio talk show in which he repeatedly claimed he had ""grave concerns"" about her medical fitness -- based on nothing more than having read Dr. Bardack's two-page statement. He was roundly criticized by other medical professionals for doing so.:While Pinsky's speculation was that Clinton suffers from brain damage, a later entrant in the armchair diagnosis field, Dr. Ted Noel of Orlando, Florida, claimed he could prove via cherry-picked news articles, photos, and video clips of the candidate that she likely suffers from Parkinson's disease. Noel's 16-minute video, titled ""Hillary Clinton's Illness Revealed,"" starts with this disclaimer:I am a medical doctor with 36 years of experience, but I am not Hillary Clinton's treating physician, so I can't claim that what I'm about to tell you is a conclusive diagnosis. Nevertheless, at the end of a litany of hearsay, conjecture, and conspiracy theories Noel states, flat out: ""Hillary Clinton has advanced Parkinson's disease.""We'll examine some of his evidence and arguments momentarily, but first, here's what we know about Dr. Ted Noel himself:1. Dr. Ted Noel is a board-certified physician with 36 years of experience -- as an anesthesiologist: That doesn't mean he's incapable of recognizing symptoms of Parkinson's disease, but consider this: If your primary care doctor suspected you had Parkinson's and wished to refer you to a specialist to confirm the diagnosis, it would be to a neurologist, not an anesthesiologist.2. Dr. Noel has never conducted a medical examination of the patient (Hillary Clinton) he purports to diagnose. How accurate and reliable can such a medical diagnosis be? As we noted in the case of Dr. Drew Pinsky above, most medical professionals consider this inappropriate behavior on the part of a physician, if not downright unethical. Would you accept a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease on the basis of a few minutes of video watched by a doctor you've never met?3. Dr. Noel's assessment of Clinton is neither objective nor impartial: In fact, Noel's assessment is nakedly partisan in intent, despite this feigned disavowal that he makes toward the end of the video:Let us not confuse medical and political issues here. I'm firmly opposed to Hillary Clinton on political and moral grounds, but this discussion has been about her medical condition.That's after Noel has described Clinton as ""a politician who lies about everything,"" and after he has made this statement about her ""medical"" condition:Our president must always be strong and clear-headed. If she is not doing the job, then who will? Will it be Huma Abedin, who has been associated with Muslim causes and directly involved in the Clinton Foundation corruption? Will it be Bill Clinton, who is at the center of the Clinton Foundation corruption? ... Or will Vice President Tim Kaine take over? Of course, then the Clintons would lose their juice.What is the above, if not precisely ""confusing medical and political issues""?:4. Noel is a conspiracy theorist We're not just throwing that out as a dismissive epithet; we mean he is a conspiracy theorist. The fundamental premise of this video is that Hillary Clinton and everyone around her -- her doctor, her family and friends, the inner circle of her campaign, and the Democratic National Committee -- know full well that she (supposedly) has an incapacitating disease and are willfully concealing that fact from the public to gain power.Let's move on to consider the ""evidence"" Dr. Ted Noel uses to support his claim that Hillary Clinton has Parkinson's disease.The Secret Service whistleblower According to a conspiracy web site, an unnamed Secret Service whistleblower revealed that Clinton has Parkinson's. Note well, however, Noel is here citing a secondhand report from a single, unnamed source published on the Alex Jones web site Infowars.com, which at one time or another has pushed every conspiracy theory known to humankind, from allegations that President George W. Bush authorized the 9/11 attacks (which, by the way, weren't really ""attacks"" according to this site, but rather ""controlled demolitions"") to the claim that President Barack Obama forged his own birth certificate. :The Wikileaks e-mail Noel says WikiLeaks released U.S. State Department e-mails which show that Clinton asked aides to research new Parkinson's disease drugs. Not true. Among the messages WikiLeaks released was one e-mail received by Clinton that contained information about Provigil, a prescription drug described in that message as follows:Provigil is used to treat excessive sleepiness caused by narcolepsy or shift work sleep disorder (sleepiness during scheduled waking hours among people who work at night or on rotating shifts). It is also often prescribed to treat excessive sleepiness in patients with Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and multiple sclerosis. Additionally, it has also gained a following among students, truckers, and others who want to stay awake for extended periods of time.In simpler terms, Provigil is used to treat excessive sleepiness. Sometimes that excessive sleepiness is in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's patients. Other times it's in people suffering from sleep apnea, narcolepsy, or shift work sleep disorder. Is it accurate to describe Provigil as ""a new Parkinson's disease drug""? No. Are there Wikileaks e-mails indicating that Clinton specifically asked staffers to research Parkinson's drugs? No (check for yourself).:Faints and falls Noel attempts to link three separate incidents over a period of years in which Clinton fainted and/or fell, implying that the stated explanations for each hid the ""real"" cause, Parkinson's disease. 31 January 2005: Clinton said she was feeling ""queasy"" as she began a speech in upstate New York and later fainted at the podium. Secret Service agents broke her fall, so she was unhurt. ""Oddly, she did not seek medical attention,"" Noel claims, but, even more oddly, an image of a CNN article reporting that she did receive medical attention at scene from a doctor in the audience flashes on screen at the exact moment he says it. The physician, Dr. Stephanie Pincus, said Clinton had been suffering from a GI virus for at least a day, and needed fluids and a rest. Nothing mysterious.17 June 2009: Clinton fell and broke her elbow on her way from the elevator to her car in the basement of the State Department. Noel again uses the word ""odd"" to describe the incident, wondering why Secret Service agents weren't able to break her fall, as they had done in the previous incident. ""She would have to fall at a distance from them with no warning,"" he opines. And, indeed, according to news reports, she slipped and fell -- obviously without warning. Nothing mysterious.:17 December 2012: Clinton fainted in her home due to dehydration and struck her head, causing a concussion. ""But again, this is very odd,"" Noel says. ""To strike your head requires a complete loss of protective reflexes."" Which, not very oddly at all, is precisely what occurs when you faint and lose consciousness. ""Being wobbly from dehydration won't do this,"" he argues. But no one is talking about ""being wobbly."" Clinton fainted; she lost consciousness, fell, and hit her head. And dehydration is frequently cited as a cause of fainting. Nothing mysterious.Why does Noel try so hard to make it seem there was something inexplicable about each of these incidents? Here's why: ""If Hillary has Parkinson's disease,"" Noel says, ""all three falls make sense"" -- as if they're impossible to make sense of without the Parkinson's explanation. But, as we've just shown, that is not the case.Brain freeze  ""Early in 2016,"" Noel continues, ""Hillary's problems started to be really obvious. Videos of odd physical movements and brain freezes became common. This is consistent with the progression of Parkinson's disease into its later and more troublesome stages.:""The first picture to surface is Hillary being helped up a set of porch steps in February. Once again, if she froze while climbing the steps, the people right next to her could catch her and keep her from injury."":But there's no reason to suppose that she ""froze."" The original caption on this Getty Images photo, dated 24 February 2016, says she slipped while going up the stairs.Head nodding ""tremor"" Noel then directs our attention to a video clip in which Clinton is seen nodding repetitively as other people speak::""To most people, that was just odd,"" says Noel, once again employing his favorite adjective. ""But if we think about Parkinson's disease, it's obvious. This is a head nodding tremor.""No, it isn't. It's a tic Hillary Clinton has had for a long time, since at least the early '90s, usually in evidence when she's listening to another public speaker. Here's an example from 1993::Hand postures Noel next shows a video of a Clinton campaign rally on 2 April 2016, in which he claims she uses certain ""techniques to hide tremors in her hands."" The first is placing her hand flat on her chest, and the second is a gesture in which her fingers come together to form a sort of point -- both of which he claims she does to prevent the audience from noticing tremors. But, in fact, if you watch more of the video than the few seconds Noel shows us, and with the audio turned on, you see that she's clearly using these gestures to emphasize verbal statements, and to suggest to the audience that they're heartfelt. Plus, she transitions easily in and out of these hand gestures, never once displaying anything like a ""tremor"" when she's not using them.""Dyskenesia"" Noel next presents a series of images and clips, including every conspiracy theorist's favorite Hillary Clinton video -- the same one that they have previously tried to pass off as an ""epileptic seizure"" -- and claims, again, that the real explanation is Parkinson's. Here's the famous video::This is ""another Parkinson's disease problem,"" Noel claims, ""but this time it's from the treatment, not the disease. It's an example of Parkinson's disease levadopa-induced dyskinesia, or PD LID.""But no, it's not. As we reported previously, the journalists surrounding her at that moment saw nothing amiss or disturbing in her actions. Associated Press reporter Lisa Lerer described it as follows::As an Associated Press reporter who's spent more than a year covering her candidacy, I was there for her appearance. After she ordered herself a ""cold chai,"" my colleagues and I shouted some questions, mostly about Clinton's recent meeting with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.Perhaps eager to avoid answering or maybe just taken aback by our volume, Clinton responded with an exaggerated motion, shaking her head vigorously for a few seconds. Video of the moment shows me holding out my recorder in front of her, laughing and stepping back in surprise. After the exchange, she took a few more photos, exited the shop and greeted supporters waiting outside.In closing, we wish to make it clear what our aim has been in this analysis. We have not tried to make the case that Hillary Clinton does not have Parkinson's disease (in point of fact, we don't think that case even needs making). Rather, we have shown that what Ted Noel did in this video is systematically misrepresent perfectly ordinary and explicable phenomena as ""Parkinson's disease symptoms,"" and his motivation for doing so was purely political."
502,502,72.ConspiracyTheoriesAb,"The now-predictable spike of distressing conspiracy theories and false flag claims after mass shootings or casualty events has become nearly a given, but the disinformation appeared to reach even higher heights after the 14 February 2018 Parkland school shooting killed seventeen people.False flag rumors are far from new, and yet each new version is treated like a grand revelation -- one that has never resulted in any outcome that might have justified staging the event. Although the Sandy Hook shooting was not the first event of its type to spawn such claims, it did seem to catapult the rumors and their reach to new heights.Chances are you've seen one, several, or all of these claims pop up on social media after a mass shooting:The Second ShooterSecond shooter conspiracy theories far predate school or mass shootings or the online fallout that follows them. After the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, conspiracy theories began to circulate almost immediately after President Kennedy was shot, mostly through news broadcasts and gossip. Decades later, the ""second shooter"" claim remained one of the most enduring -- despite the National Academy of Sciences' Committee on Ballistic Acoustics 1982 finding that ""reliable acoustic data do not support a conclusion that there was a second gunman."":Nevertheless, the ""second shooter"" became somewhat of a fallback claim to suggest any official narrative is faulty. After the Sandy Hook shooting the claim took root once again, likely due to the detainment of parent Chris Manfredonia, who was not involved but who was briefly handcuffed after running into the school to search for his daughter directly after the shooting.Incidentally, two shooters were present at what is largely considered the first school shooting of its type: Columbine in 1999. Although two perpetrators, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, carried out the massacre, no one disputed its legitimacy at the time, and despite the fact two shooters were involved, the shooting was not described as a ""false flag.""Crisis ActorsAnother conspiracy trope that got a foothold after the Sandy Hook shooting involved the increasingly absurd notion that ""crisis actors"" are hired to represent victims, the bereaved, or both. Not long after that incident, family members of slain children and survivors of the massacre were harassed and threatened for being ""paid actors."" Notable instances of the claim occurred after the Pulse nightclub shooting, and again following the Parkland, Florida shooting.:One iteration of the claim involves the ""same girl,"" who is purportedly present at various crime scenes, vigils, or funerals spanning continents:Real people are dead and grieving after school shootings; they're not acting: https://t.co/iqXzZdKz1B-- snopes.com (@snopes) February 20, 2018The assertion crumbles under even a tiny amount of scrutiny. Nonetheless, conspiracy theorists playing at being amateur detectives still claim that young women with long hair crying at the scenes of mass casualty events are clear signs that the events are not what they seem.Timestamp LawyeringThe ""hole in the narrative"" rumor based on news and social media timestamps is now a fixture after tragic events. After a Virginia shooting made headlines, conspiracy theorists claimed timestamps on social media posts revealed the tragedy was a hoax, a claim that popped up yet again after the Parkland school shooting.:A Google spokesperson told us that timestamps have been a known issue with search engines for years:Listing the date and time for news stories is complicated, as there is no universal standard used. Sometimes, stories have no date and time on the webpage. Sometimes, a story may appear on a page that lists related stories, and they all have different dates and times shown. Sometimes a publisher might be in a different time zone and the date gets picked up incorrectly. All these things may cause us to occasionally list the wrong date. We're looking at ways to improve.To Pass Gun Control LegislationThe Sandy Hook massacre, which left twenty children and six adults dead, was arguably the genesis of mass and school shooting truthers. That began (and continues) with rumors often based on unsourced blog posts, such as one published by a woman using the handle ""Short Little Rebel"" on 16 December 2012::I believe our GOVERNMENT shot those kids and teachers and used Adam Lanza and his family to pull it off. They might have killed two birds with one stone. One: If these men are involved in the LIBOR scandal, they can manipulate their testimony. Two: they get gun control. How very, very clever and efficient of them, right? I hate to say it. I hate to put myself 'out there' with this because I KNOW how I will be attacked. But I don't do this for anyone's approval. I do it to help the American People.But Why?Nearly every mass shooting since on American soil has led to embittered fighting both among lawmakers and on social media, occurring under the assumption that gun control legislation will yank firearms from the hands of American citizens. While that is presumably the reason for the many ""false flag"" events invoking these tropes, not a one has led to any massive change to gun laws.Another reason for conspiracy theorizing is a simple one: It offers a certain idea of predictability and order in a world that seems more chaotic by the year. For some, it is undoubtedly better and easier to go about their day assuming not that they could be shot at random by a madman at any given second, but that no one has actually died in any of these horrific events and that some sort of greater power is putting together hoaxes in order to manipulate public opinion.:That there might be some higher order and that no mass shootings ever have taken place may be a comforting idea for some people, certainly, but it's also one that has absolutely no basis in fact -- as anyone who has either been through one themselves or lost a loved one could undoubtedly tell you."
503,503,582.IsTetanusVaccineSpik,"Claim:Ongoing tetanus vaccine campaigns in Kenya are a ruse to sterilize women of childbearing age.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In October 2014, a group of concerned Catholic bishops in Kenya released a statement claiming a tetanus vaccine program aimed at women entering or in their childbearing years was in actuality a stealth attempt to sterilize women en masse for unstated reasons.:Among questions raised by the group in its statement about the tetanus vaccine campaign in Kenya were why the vaccines were considered necessary if no ""tetanus crisis in Kenya"" had been declared, why the vaccine was offered primarily to women between the ages of 14 and 49, why boys and men were not targeted by the campaign, and why tetanus was ""prioritized"" over other illnesses affecting citizens of Kenya:We are not convinced that the government has taken adequate responsibility to ensure that Tetanus Toxoid vaccine (TT) laced with Beta human chorionic gonadotropin (b-HCG) sub unit is not being used by the sponsoring development partners. This has previously been used by the same partners in Philippines, Nicaragua and Mexico to vaccinate women against future pregnancy. Beta HCG sub unit is a hormone necessary for pregnancy.When injected as a vaccine to a non-pregnant woman, this Beta HCG sub unit combined with tetanus toxoid develops antibodies against tetanus and HCG so that if a woman's egg becomes fertilized, her own natural HCG will be destroyed rendering her permanently infertile. In this situation tetanus vaccination has been used as a birth control method.We retain that the tetanus vaccination campaign bears the hallmarks of the programmes that were carried out in Philippines, Mexico and Nicaragua. We would want to participate in ensuring that the vaccines to be administered are free of this hormone.:A Catholic doctors' group in Kenya echoed the concerns of the bishops, and an anti-abortion site quoted Dr. Muhame Ngare of the Mercy Medical Centre in Nairobi as saying:We sent six samples from around Kenya to laboratories in South Africa. They tested positive for the HCG antigen. They were all laced with HCG.This proved right our worst fears; that this WHO campaign is not about eradicating neonatal tetanus but a well-coordinated forceful population control mass sterilization exercise using a proven fertility regulating vaccine. This evidence was presented to the Ministry of Health before the third round of immunization but was ignored.Dr. Collins Tabu, the head of immunization at Kenya's Health Ministry, refuted the claim and said women immunized under the program in recent years subsequently conceived, prompting Dr. Ngare to respond with:Either we are lying or the government is lying. But ask yourself, 'What reason do the Catholic doctors have for lying?' The Catholic Church has been here in Kenya providing health care and vaccinating for 100 years for longer than Kenya has existed as a country.Usually we give a series three shots over two to three years, we give it anyone who comes into the clinic with an open wound, men, women or children. If this is intended to inoculate children in the womb, why give it to girls starting at 15 years? You cannot get married till you are 18.:Dr. Ngare's forced choice between the doctors or the Kenyan government neglects a third possibility: someone, somewhere is sincere but mistaken. His statement about the timing of vaccinations in respect to the earliest age women can marry in Kenya is a good illustration of fallacious thinking -- since the vaccine is given in a five-shot series, beginning administration three years prior to marrying age makes more sense than exposing women who are married but not yet immunized to losing children to tetanus.The expressed concerns of Ngare and bishops in Kenya are the same as false rumors circulated over two decades ago in several other countries (Mexico, Tanzania, Nicaragua, and the Philippines) where the WHO and UNICEF undertook tetanus vaccination programs:Rumours have circulated recently in Mexico, Tanzania, Nicaragua, and the Philippines that WHO and UNICEF are using women as guinea pigs to test a contraceptive vaccine given to them under the guide of tetanus toxoid vaccine. These rumours, apparently initiated by so-called 'pro-life' groups, are completely untrue. The vaccines do not contain contraceptive vaccines of any other substance which interferes with fertility of pregnancy and their labeling accurately describes their actual contents. The false claims made by these groups have had an adverse impact on immunisation programmes in all four countries.:These rumors (and similar ones concerning polio vaccination programs) have several aspects, one being the focus on women of childbearing age in Kenya. Neonatal tetanus resulted in the deaths of 550 Kenyan babies in 2013, and according to UNICEF, 58,000 babies worldwide died of neonatal tetanus in 2010 (a count that includes only known tetanus deaths). The organization explained the necessity of tetanus immunization in countries such as Kenya, and how the scope of the problem could be even larger than has been recorded to date:Maternal and neonatal tetanus represents a very high proportion of the total tetanus disease burden due mainly to inadequate immunization services, limited or absent clean delivery services and improper post-partum cord care. The majority of mothers and newborns dying of tetanus live in Africa and Southern and East Asia, generally in areas where women are poor, have little access to health care, and have little information about safe delivery practices.Once the disease is contracted, the fatality rate can be as high as 100% without hospital care and between 10% to 60% with hospital care. The true extent of the tetanus death toll is not known as many newborns and mothers die at home and neither the birth nor the death is reported.:That information was echoed in an interview with James Elder, UNICEF's Chief of Communications for East Africa, by the Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute (C-Fam):C-Fam: Are WHO and UNICEF experimenting with hCG vaccines in Kenya?Elder: No.The aim of the vaccination is to eliminate neonatal tetanus in Kenya through vaccination campaigns in districts that have been identified as at high risk for maternal and neonatal tetanus.C-Fam: Why would only the female population of child bearing age be targeted for this specific tetanus vaccination program?Elder: The aim of the vaccination campaign is to prevent neonatal tetanus in newborns who are the most vulnerable and bear the highest burden of tetanus disease. These children live in the parts of the country with limited access to health facilities -- most births occur at home in unhygienic conditions. Some of the babies are born to girls as young as 15 years old from communities living in marginalized areas. Children born at home under unhygienic conditions are at risk of tetanus infection through the cut umbilical cord. Their mothers are also at risk of infection with tetanus infection during childbirth.:Vaccinating girls and women of child bearing age (15 to 49 years) accords protection to the women even if they deliver at home in unhygienic conditions. They pass this protection to the unborn child in the womb. For the babies born to women who have received the required doses of the vaccine this protection from tetanus lasts for a few weeks after birth. That is why they have to get TT vaccine again through the routine immunization programme.C-Fam: Why does the Tetanus vaccine require 5 doses, when usually tetanus vaccination only requires one shot every 5 to 10 years?Elder: During vaccination campaigns that aim to protect newborns living in areas with limited access to health facilities, 3 doses are administered. The second dose after 1 month or soon thereafter and the third dose after 6 months. The 3 doses provide protection for 5 years. These are additional doses as most people have received some TT vaccine when they cut themselves or during visits to Antenatal clinics when pregnant. Five doses are recommended in the Kenya Vaccination policy to anyone (male or female) as it offers protection against tetanus for life.Another aspect of the debate concerns contraceptive vaccines, a medical initiative that has long been in the testing phase. However, the Catholic bishops in Kenya are not claiming that Kenyan women are being given the equivalent of a contraceptive vaccine (something which in current form would have to be readministered every few months to be effective), but rather are being sterilized through the injection of a substance (b-HCG) that renders them permanently infertile.:The Kenya Catholic Doctors Association claimed they had tested samples of the tetanus vaccine used in Kenya and found them to be laced with (b-HCG) (a component of experimental birth control vaccines), but UNICEF noted that there was no laboratory in Kenya capable of making an accurate analysis of that nature:The tests were done in hospital laboratories in Kenya. The staff in these laboratories could not however tell whether the samples were vaccines or not, as this was not declared to the testing laboratories by the Catholic Doctors Association. The laboratories tested the samples for hCG using analyzers used for testing human samples like blood and urine for pregnancy. There is no laboratory in Kenya with the capacity to test non-human samples like vaccine for hCG.Again, this aspect of the claim perfectly mirrors similar rumors spread decades earlier during the course of tetanus vaccination programs in several other countries:After these rumours were spread, attempts were made to analyse TT vaccines for the presence of hCG. The vaccines were sent to hospital laboratories and tested using pregnancy test kits which are developed for use on serum and urine specimens, and are not appropriate for a vaccine such as TT, which contains a special preservative (merthiolate) and an adjuvant (aluminum salt). As a consequence of using these inappropriate tests, low levels of hCG-like activity were found in some samples of TT vaccine. The laboratories themselves recognised the insignificance of the results, which were below the reliable detection capability of the kits and were due to a nonspecific interaction between the adjuvant or other substances in the vaccine and the test kit. However, these results were misrepresented by the 'pro-life' groups with the resulting disruption of immunisation campaigns.When the vaccines were tested in laboratories which used properly validated test systems, the results clearly showed that the vaccines did not contain hCG. The low levels of hCG-like activity seen in some samples were the result of false positive reactions. In fact, in a laboratory in Hungary, it was shown that the sterile water supply from the local hospital gave a higher false positive level of hCG than did the TT vaccine.:The conspiracy theory that Kenya's tetanus vaccination program is actually aimed at sterilization, not vaccination, has had staying power long after the original controversy passed. This is, in part, thanks to one of the companies tasked to perform analyses by the Catholic Doctors Association losing their laboratory accreditation years after the fact.In December 2016, a company that had been involved in efforts to test the tetanus vaccine -- Agriq-Quest -- was audited by both the Kenya Accreditation Service (KENAS) and the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC). That audit resulted in Agri-Quest losing its laboratory accreditation. A former employee who resigned from Agriq-Quest told Business Daily Africa in January 2017 that the lab had been claiming to perform analyses they were not capable of performing:A former employee at Agriq-Quest who requested anonymity for fear of victimisation claimed that the lab lacked capacity to carry out the tests it was handling for its clients, including the Ministry of Health [...].:Agriq-Quest, however, claimed through an attorney that their loss of accreditation came as a result of more nefarious reasons -- the government hadn't paid them for analyses they performed on behalf of the Ministry of Health and The Catholic Doctors Association because the Ministry wanted them to doctor their results:Agriq-Quest, through their lawyer Gitobu Imanyara, last year claimed that the government had not paid them Sh13.8 million for tests performed on controversial tetanus and polio vaccines.They claimed that the government's decision was as a result of the company's refusal to doctor results in favour on the Ministry of Health which had jointly asked for the analysis with the Catholic Church.The company's results from tests carried out on the vials showed that the samples of the vaccines were contaminated as had been claimed by the Catholic Church and Agriq-Quest claimed the government wanted the results altered to show that they were fit to be administered to women and children.While no evidence has been offered to suggest that narrative was anything other than a desperate PR move by a business whose accreditation had been revoked, the claim of a government's mandating doctored results to sell a secret sterilization program has not been ignored by conspiracy minded websites such as Your News Wire, which continued to promote Agriq-Quest's claims as recently as February 2018.:Despite such claims, no compelling evidence exists that the tetanus vaccination program in Kenya has been in any way animated by a desire to sterilize Kenyan women. Such claims have their roots in laboratory testing widely considered to have been flawed in method."

I ain't scared of nothing,"" said Nugent before going on a tangent about ""knowing every songbird.""At about the 1:30 mark, the musician then lamented the decisions made by production companies to cancel tours in 2021.""We are not waiting for any authorization from any bureaucratic entity to say, 'you can go ahead and tour now.' You know, this year's tour is canceled again. Are you kidding me? The production companies won't let us tour again this year,"" said Nugent. ""Dirty, bastards, lying, scam, smoke and mirrors, COVID-19 freaks.""And at the 2:20 mark, the 72-year-old asked his viewers the following::You know, I guess I would ask you -- because I'm addicted to truth, logic and common sense -- and my common-sense meter would demand the answer to why weren't we shut down for COVID one through 18?COVID-1 -- and there was a COVID 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 -- COVID one through 18 didn't shut anything down but woah, COVID-19!He did not appear to be joking.:Much of the information included in Nugent's social media rant was misleading and rife with misinformation. For example, Nugent echoed erroneous claims that numbers of reported COVID-19 deaths have been exaggerated (we fact-checked similar claims here, here, and here) and questioned whether the 500,000 total death count was accurate. (As of this writing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention listed more than 539,000 associated deaths in the U.S.) Nugent also claimed that COVID-19 is ""99.8% survivable"" (False) and questioned why there were no shutdowns for other pandemics like the so-called Spanish Flu of 1918 (In fact, there were many.)The respiratory disease COVID-19 was named in February 2020 for the coronavirus that causes it -- SARS-CoV-2 -- and the year in which the first disease case was reported -- 2019. Following that logic, Nugent's proclamation of a ""COVID one through 18"" would suggest that there had been 18 years of coronavirus infection rates at a global scale, which is unfounded.And though COVID-19 is the only respiratory disease to be caused by SARS-CoV-2, other coronaviruses have prompted government response in the last two decades. Coronaviruses make up a large family of zoonotic viruses that are found around the world in a variety of animals, from bats and pangolins to tigers, dogs, and humans.:The 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was also caused by a coronavirus, SARS-CoV, and marked the ""first pandemic of the 21st century."" According to the CDC, the disease did not spread widely in U.S. communities and though the country did not go on lockdown, the health agency issued a number of emergency responses to battle a potential widespread outbreak. Globally, a total of 8,098 people worldwide became sick with SARS, 774 of whom died. Only eight people in the U.S. were laboratory-confirmed to have been infected by the virus. Similarly, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a coronavirus caused by MERS-CoV and was first reported in September 2012. But only two people in the U.S. have ever tested positive for MERS-CoV infection -- both in May 2014."
505,505,81.PlandemicandtheSeven,"This article is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.The conspiracy theory video ""Plandemic"" recently went viral. Despite being taken down by YouTube and Facebook, it continues to get uploaded and viewed millions of times. The video is an interview with conspiracy theorist Judy Mikovits, a disgraced former virology researcher who believes the COVID-19 pandemic is based on vast deception, with the purpose of profiting from selling vaccinations.The video is rife with misinformation and conspiracy theories. Many high-quality fact-checks and debunkings have been published by reputable outlets such as Snopes, Science, Politifact and FactCheck.As scholars who research how to counter science misinformation and conspiracy theories, we believe there is also value in exposing the rhetorical techniques used in ""Plandemic."" As we outline in our Conspiracy Theory Handbook and How to Spot COVID-19 Conspiracy Theories, there are seven distinctive traits of conspiratorial thinking. ""Plandemic"" offers textbook examples of them all.:Learning these traits can help you spot the red flags of a baseless conspiracy theory and hopefully build up some resistance to being taken in by this kind of thinking. This is an important skill given the current surge of pandemic-fueled conspiracy theories.The seven traits of conspiratorial thinking.John Cook, CC BY-ND:1. Contradictory beliefsConspiracy theorists are so committed to disbelieving an official account, it doesn't matter if their belief system is internally contradictory. The ""Plandemic"" video advances two false origin stories for the coronavirus. It argues that SARS-CoV-2 came from a lab in Wuhan - but also argues that everybody already has the coronavirus from previous vaccinations, and wearing masks activates it. Believing both causes is mutually inconsistent.2. Overriding suspicionConspiracy theorists are overwhelmingly suspicious toward the official account. That means any scientific evidence that doesn't fit into the conspiracy theory must be faked.But if you think the scientific data is faked, that leads down the rabbit hole of believing that any scientific organization publishing or endorsing research consistent with the ""official account"" must be in on the conspiracy. For COVID-19, this includes the World Health Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, Anthony Fauci... basically, any group or person who actually knows anything about science must be part of the conspiracy.:3. Nefarious intentIn a conspiracy theory, the conspirators are assumed to have evil motives. In the case of ""Plandemic,"" there's no limit to the nefarious intent. The video suggests scientists including Anthony Fauci engineered the COVID-19 pandemic, a plot which involves killing hundreds of thousands of people so far for potentially billions of dollars of profit.:Conspiratorial thinking finds evil intentions at all levels of the presumed conspiracy.MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images4. Conviction something's wrongConspiracy theorists may occasionally abandon specific ideas when they become untenable. But those revisions tend not to change their overall conclusion that ""something must be wrong"" and that the official account is based on deception.When ""Plandemic"" filmmaker Mikki Willis was asked if he really believed COVID-19 was intentionally started for profit, his response was ""I don't know, to be clear, if it's an intentional or naturally occurring situation. I have no idea.""He has no idea. All he knows for sure is something must be wrong: ""It's too fishy.""5. Persecuted victim:Conspiracy theorists think of themselves as the victims of organized persecution. ""Plandemic"" further ratchets up the persecuted victimhood by characterizing the entire world population as victims of a vast deception, which is disseminated by the media and even ourselves as unwitting accomplices. At the same time, conspiracy theorists see themselves as brave heroes taking on the villainous conspirators.6. Immunity to evidenceIt's so hard to change a conspiracy theorist's mind because their theories are self-sealing. Even absence of evidence for a theory becomes evidence for the theory: The reason there's no proof of the conspiracy is because the conspirators did such a good job covering it up. 7. Reinterpreting randomness:Conspiracy theorists see patterns everywhere - they're all about connecting the dots. Random events are reinterpreted as being caused by the conspiracy and woven into a broader, interconnected pattern. Any connections are imbued with sinister meaning.For example, the ""Plandemic"" video suggestively points to the U.S. National Institutes of Health funding that has gone to the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China.

509,509,24.AreConspiracyTheorie,"Have the internet and social media created a climate where Americans believe anything is possible? With headlines citing now as the age of conspiracy, is it really true? In a word, no. While it may be true that the internet has allowed people who believe in conspiracies to communicate more, it has not increased the number of Americans who believe in conspiracies, according to the data available.Current beliefsA ""conspiracy theory"" is a theory that explains an event or set of circumstances as the result of a secret plot, usually by powerful conspirators.For example, take Pizzagate, the theory that Washington elite engaged in child sex trafficking at the basement of a D.C. pizzeria, which 9% of the American population believe to be true.:Over 29% of the American population believe there is a ""Deep State"" working against President Donald Trump. Nineteen percent believe that the government is using chemicals to control the population.These conspiracy theories are not simply restricted to a fringe population. At least 50% of Americans believe in at least one conspiracy theory, ranging from the idea that the 9/11 attacks were fake to the belief that former President Barack Obama was not born in the U.S. :Historical dataThere are no major comprehensive, longitudinal studies on Americans' attitudes toward conspiracy theories, mostly because it was not rigorously measured until about 10 to 20 years ago. However, researchers have done a considerate amount of work in recent years in an attempt to understand this apparent phenomenon. Political scientists Joseph E. Uscinski and Joseph M. Parent reviewed over 120 years of letters to the editor, from 1890 to 2010, for both The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.In over 100,000 letters, this review showed absolutely no change in the amount of conspiracy theory belief over time. In fact, the percent of letters about conspiracy theories actually declined from the late 1800s to the 1960s and has remained steady since then. :While these researchers looked at data only up until 2010, current polling has not shown any uptick in conspiracy theory belief since then. The end is near?As Uscinski and Parent pointed out, this isn't the first time Americans may have felt surrounded by conspiracies.In 2004, the Boston Globe stated that we are in the ""golden age of conspiracy theory.""In 1994, the Washington Post declared it's the ""dawn of a new age of conspiracy theory.""In 1964, The New York Times said conspiracy theories had ""grown weed like in this country."":The list could go on and on, but the gist is clear.  Whether it is the invention of the printing press, mass publishing, the telegraph, radio, cable, the internet or social media, researchers and the general public have historically proclaimed that this - or this, or this - new advance is the change-maker in political realities.

Get ready to explode folks. ""The new litmus test of leadership in the military is if they will fire on US citizens or not"". Those who will not are being removed.How seriously should one take this warning that the military is being purged of those who won't agree to fire on U.S. citizens? Consider that: The only supporting evidence for this claim was a single, second-hand account from an anonymous source. Not a single reputable news outlet reported any such story. Not a single member of the U.S. military or the U.S. government has come forward to confirm the claim in the nearly three years since it originated. No evidence documents that the U.S. military has experienced a purging of leaders from its ranks for ""refusing to fire on U.S. citizens."" This claim fits a common model of conspiracy theory which has been repeatedly espoused many times over (but has never proved true).

In Oct. 25, 2021, a Snopes reader alerted us to an alleged conspiracy regarding COVID-19 vaccine ingredients. According to the rumor, vaccine recipients were supposedly being injected with formulas containing more ingredients than what the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had ""approved"" for the immunizations.""The FDA approved version of the 'vaccine' had 3 ingredients. The version being injected into the public has 7,"" the reader wrote to us, referring to a post supposedly seen on Facebook.:The reader's inquiry included other claims, including the false notion that FDA-endorsed formulas by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson (J&J) did not ""fit the definition"" of vaccines but were rather ""experimental treatments"" for the coronavirus. (Here's a portal of evidence on the FDA's website outlining the agency's approval of the immunizations, debunking that assertion.) For the purpose of this fact check, however, we will focus on the allegation about the immunizations' amount of ingredients.[See also from Snopes: Does J&J COVID-19 Vaccine Contain Aborted Fetal Cells?]Before we address the crux of the claim, a note on semantics: As of this writing, the FDA had only granted ""full approval"" to one type of vaccine -- Pfizer's. However, the federal agency gave the formulas by Moderna and J&J ""emergency use authorizations"" (EUA), allowing for their mass distribution to help end the deadly pandemic as fast as possible. That endorsement, while it was not a full approval, confirmed the shots' safety and effectiveness after testing them on tens of thousands of people.:While the post displayed above used the phrase ""FDA-approved"" without specifying which immunization it was referring to, we considered ingredients for all three vaccines, no matter if they had full FDA approval or EUA's.Firstly, here's the FDA's list of ingredients for Pfizer's shot, as outlined via documentation on its website:mRNA, lipids ((4- hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate), 2 [(polyethylene glycol)-2000]-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide, 1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and cholesterol), potassium chloride, monobasic potassium phosphate, sodium chloride, dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate, and sucrose.In other words, the formula contained mRNA molecules (the messenger ribonucleic acids that help immune systems fight COVID-19), as well as salt, sugar, a variety of fatty acids and a handful of other compounds, for a total of seven ingredients.:Next, we considered the FDA's list of elements that make up Moderna and J&J's formulas, respectively. They are as follows, according to FDA records obtained by Snopes:Like Pfizer's shot, those immunizations contain seven or eight ingredients -- not three, like the post claimed.Next, we sought evidence to confirm or deny the allegation that vaccine administrators at certified sites across the U.S.-- either at clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, etc. -- had injected people with fluids that did not contain the above-listed ingredients. We found no reported instances of that happening, whether intentionally or unintentionally. (That's not to say fraudulent vaccines don't exist. Get more information from the FDA on those here.):In sum, we considered the claim that people were receiving COVID-19 vaccinations containing more ingredients than what the FDA had endorsed for the public a baseless conspiracy theory. As such, we rate this claim ""False.""More Snopes' fact checks addressing rumors about COVID-19 vaccine ingredients:No, the mRNA Vaccines Do Not Contain Graphene OxideDoes Pfizer's COVID-19 Vaccine Contain Aborted Fetal Cells?No, mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Do Not 'Alter Your DNA'"

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.Most conspiracy theories surrounding President John F. Kennedy's assassination have been disproven. Kennedy was not killed by a gas-powered device triggered by aliens or by actor Woody Harrelson's dad.But speculation about Kennedy's Nov. 22, 1963 murder in Dallas continues, fueled by unreleased classified documents, bizarre ballistics and the claim of assassin Lee Harvey Oswald - who was later killed on live TV while in police custody - that he was ""just a patsy.""Several JFK assassination experts, like the former New York Times investigative reporter Phillip Shenon, see Mexico as the best place to find answers regarding a possible conspiracy and who was behind it. ::Oswald's Mexico visa from 1963, with entry and exit stamps.Mexican Secretary of the InteriorJust over a month before Kennedy's killing, Oswald took a bus from Texas to Mexico City. He arrived Friday morning, Sept. 27, 1963 and left very early on Wednesday, Oct. 2, according to American and Mexican intelligence.Was Oswald a kind of rogue James Bond who went south of the border to consort with communists, Cuban revolutionaries and spies - or just a deranged killer?I dug into that question while researching my book on conspiracy narratives in Mexico, and I think I found something everybody else missed: a hole in the story of the very man who started a tenacious conspiracy theory about Oswald's Mexico trip.Communist Mexico CityMexico was a Cold War hot spot in the mid-20th century, a haven for Soviet exiles, American leftists fleeing the anti-communist persecution of McCarthyism and sympathizers with Cuba's Castro regime. Every communist and democratic country had an embassy in Mexico City - the only place in the Western Hemisphere where these enemies coexisted more or less openly.::Russian exile Leon Trotsky and his wife, Natalia Sedova, meet artist and communist Diego Rivera in Mexico City, 1937.Enrique Diaz/Galerie Bilderwelt/Getty ImagesAccording to witnesses from the Cuban and Soviet diplomatic missions, Oswald visited their embassies repeatedly on Friday and Saturday. He was desperately seeking visas to those countries, which Americans were then prohibited from visiting. Told such documents would take months to process, Oswald got in a heated argument with the Cuban consul, Emilio Azcue. Oswald also forced a KGB volleyball match on Saturday morning to be canceled when he brandished a weapon at the Soviet consulate, before bursting into tears and leaving. Those events are well documented by the CIA, which in the 1960s had ramped up its Mexico operations to monitor communist activity, even hiring 200 Mexican agents to help. The Mexican Secret Service, whose 1960s-era files Mexico has recently begun to declassify, also tracked Oswald on Sept. 27 and Sept. 28, 1963. :Oswald's whereabouts for the next three-and-a-half days, however, remain unknown.A Mexican intelligence report on Lee Harvey Oswald, declassified in 2019.Pedro Pardo/AFP via Getty Images:A conspiracy theory is bornA main conspiracy about Oswald's undocumented time in Mexico City puts him in contact with dangerous Mexicans on the left side of the Cold War. This story originated in March 1967, when the American consul in the Mexican coastal city of Tampico, Benjamin Ruyle, was buying drinks for local journalists.One of them - Oscar Contreras Lartigue, a 28-year-old reporter for El Sol de Tampico - told Ruyle he'd met Oswald in 1963 when he was a law student at Mexico's National Autonomous University. Contreras said he'd been in a pro-Castro campus group and that Oswald had begged this group for help getting a Cuban visa. According to Contreras, Oswald spent two days with these National Autonomous University students, then met up with them again a few days later at the Cuban Embassy. :Evidently afraid for his life, Contreras wouldn't tell Ruyle much more. He said he himself had traveled to Cuba, knew people in the Castro regime and had blown up the statue of a former Mexican president on campus in Mexico City. Contreras feared persecution for his political activities. Contreras did say this wasn't the first time he was sharing his story, though. After JFK was shot, Contreras told Ruyle, he'd commented to his editor that he'd recently met Oswald. The Contreras questionContreras' account hinted at suspicious, previously unknown connections between Oswald and communist Cuba made shortly before JFK's assassination.His story was, according to a memo later sent from CIA headquarters, ""the first solid investigative lead we have on Oswald's activities in Mexico."" U.S. government officials needed to find out if Contreras was a trustworthy source. :Oswald's mug shot.CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images:Three months after Ruyle's happy hour, a CIA official from Mexico City went to Tampico to question Contreras. During the six-hour interrogation, Contreras still refused to go into details, but he did say Oswald never mentioned assassination - only that he said repeatedly he ""had to get to Cuba.""In 1978, a researcher from the U.S. House Select Commission on Assassinations named Dan Hardway went to Mexico to investigate the JFK assassination. He was unable to interview Contreras despite several attempts, but in an influential report warned his account should not be dismissed.  The New York Times reporter Shenon, who interviewed Oscar Contreras for a 2013 book on the JFK assassination, also found Contreras credible. Shenon wrote that Contreras - whom he calls a ""prominent journalist"" - ""went much further"" in their interview than he had with the CIA, alleging ""far more extensive contacts between Oswald and Cuban agents in Mexico.""Dan Hardway, who is now a lawyer in West Virginia, still believes Contreras. After reading Shenon's book, he reiterated in 2015 that Lee Harvey Oswald might have been part of a wider Cuban intelligence web. :Hole in the webOscar Contreras died in 2016, so I could not interview him myself. But in my investigation, a minute detail of his biography grabbed my attention - an apparently overlooked contradiction that could undermine his entire story. :A 1963 'Sol de Tampico' column by Contreras.In Contreras' telling, he fled the National Autonomous University campus and moved to Tampico around 1964. Yet Contreras also allegedly told his ""editor"" about his encounter with Oswald after the 1963 Kennedy assassination. College newspapers aren't common in Mexico, and Contreras was a law student. So how could he have had an editor in 1963? I thought his hometown paper, El Sol de Tampico, might hold the answer. Digging through its archives, I found that the newspaper ran a Sunday gossip column in the early 1960s called ""Crisol,"" or ""melting pot."" Oscar Contreras became the reporter for ""Crisol"" on June 6, 1963, and continued writing the gossip column in September and October that year. While Lee Harvey Oswald was in Mexico City, Contreras was 300 miles away in Tampico. In flamboyant prose, faded back issues of the local paper show, he chronicled the sumptuous wedding receptions, quinceaneras and yacht excursions of Tampico's high society. :Three dark daysI believe the Sol de Tampico archives discredit Contereras' account. :Contreras wrote for Sol de Tampico on Oct. 6, 1963.Sol de TampicoA political correspondent may live far from where his newspaper is published. But for a gossip columnist, that would be dereliction of duty. This revelation plunges Oswald's fall 1963 trip to Mexico back into the dark. There are other conspiracy theories, including that Oswald had a Mexican mistress who took him to a party of communists and spies. But it's more likely Mexico holds no hidden clues to JFK's assassination. Conspiracy theories offer assurances of depth and closure, a promise that the biggest enigma of the 20th century is solvable. But from what we know about what Oswald did and didn't do in Mexico City, he was a volatile, disorganized loner who couldn't even handle travel logistics. JFK's assassination is a cold case.

Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.:As U.S. President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden participated in dueling, nationally televised town halls on Oct. 15, 2020, in advance of the November election, Trump's tendency to amplify and exploit conspiracy theories came out in full force.A few weeks after Trump failed to condemn the Proud Boys, a white supremacist group, during the first presidential debate in September, he doubled down on his refusal to denounce the QAnon movement and its wide-ranging array of conspiracy theories in a heated exchange with NBC News' host Savannah Guthrie.QAnon is a fringe but popular far-right movement that can be traced back to 2017, with believers spread across the internet claiming that Trump is waging a secret war against elite, cannibalistic, Satan-worshipping pedophiles in business, government, and media. The believers argue that this battle will lead to a day of reckoning when prominent figures like Hillary Clinton and others will be executed. Their ideology unites conspiracies surrounding the ""deep state,"" UFOs, ""false flag"" events, and fake death plots.:Guthrie asked Trump if he would state that QAnon's prevailing conspiracy theory about Democrat pedophile cabals was not true, and if he would ""disavow"" QAnon in its entirety. The following exchange occurred:Trump: I know nothing about QAnon [...]Guthrie: I just told you.Trump: [...] you told me but what you tell me doesn't necessarily make it fact, I hate to say that. I know nothing about it. I do know that they are very much against pedophilia, they fight it very hard [...]Guthrie: They believe it is a Satanic cult run by the deep state.Trump: [...] study the subject. I'll tell you what I do know about. I know about Antifa, and I know about the radical left, and I know how violent they are and how vicious they are. And I know how they are burning down cities run by Democrats, not run by Republicans.Guthrie: Republican Senator Ben Sasse said, quote, ""QAnon is nuts and real leaders call conspiracy theories, conspiracy theories."":Trump: He may be right.Guthrie: Why not just say, it's crazy and not true?Trump: Can I be honest? He may be right. I just don't know about QAnon.Guthrie: You do know.Trump: I don't know. No, I don't know. I don't know. You tell me all about it.[...]Trump: [...] let me just tell you. What I do hear about it, is they are very strongly against pedophilia. And I agree with that. I mean, I do agree with that --Guthrie: Okay.Trump: ... and I agree with it very strongly.:Guthrie: But there's not a Satanic pedophile cult being run by-Trump: I have no idea. I know nothing about them.Guthrie: You don't know that? OK.Trump: No, I don't know that.The exchange indicated that Trump wanted to avoid condemning the conspiracy theories outright. Later on during the town hall, Guthrie asked him about retweeting other conspiracy theories about Joe Biden, to which Trump responded: ""that was a retweet. I'll put it out there. People can decide for themselves. I don't take a position.""Video of the full exchange starting at 13:41, can be found here::This is not the first time Trump has addressed QAnon.In August, he said from the White House: ""I don't know much about the movement other than I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate."" He suggested QAnon followers approved of how he handled unrest in Portland, Oregon, after anti-police brutality protests, and said he ""heard these are people that love our country.""Given the video evidence, and the widespread coverage, we rate this claim as ""True."""

Perhaps people wondered whether it belonged to passengers and -- what happened to the passengers? :Not to worry. While it's true that there was a large pile of baggage at the Denver airport, the bags didn't belong to passengers, and it's not as weird as some on social media seemed to think.Emily Williams, a spokesperson for the Denver airport, told Snopes in an email that the bags were purchased by the contractor installing the system, Siemens, to test a new baggage handling system that is under construction. When the photos were taken, the bags were being stored in a construction area where the airport was undergoing an upgrade known as the Great Hall Project.It may not be a surprise that anything unusual with Denver's famous airport becomes the source of conspiratorial speculation. As The Denver Post reports:""Conspiracy theories about Denver International Airport have soared for more than two decades, owing to the airport's mix of bold public art, unusual architecture, infamous construction problems and an internet-fueled cycle of self-feeding paranoia."":One of the most famous and creepy pieces of art gracing the airport is a giant, anatomically correct, blue statue of a mustang horse known as ""Blucifer."" The horse's eyes glow red. Sadly, Luis Jimenez, artist who created it, was killed in 2006 when part of the statue came loose and fell on him, leading some to believe the statue is cursed.The art murals inside the airport are also renowned for creating the mystique surrounding the airport. Other favorite conspiracy theories link the airport to secretive cabals associated with the Freemasons or New World Order, and speculate that there are meeting areas hidden there."

Origins:   In November 2014, the Huzlers web site published an article recycling the old conspiracy theory that the moon landings were fake events staged on movie sets, claiming Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin had recently admitted to such: It is being reported that the Apollo 11 missions, which landed men for the first time on the moon, was in fact fake.One of the astronauts on the Apollo 11 mission, Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin, confirmed that the Apollo 11 missions were ""fake"" and that the videos of the mission are simply showing a setup that was created to simulate how the moon and space would look. ""Apollo 11 was not real, none of it was"" Buzz Aldrin said in a video he recorded confessing to the Apollo 11 hoax, ""I am ashamed to say this but I cannot hide it anymore, it was a setup, like the ones they use in Hollywood films, back in the 60's, the U.S. was competing with the Soviet Union to achieve space flight supremacy, which was known as the ""space race"". We were afraid the Soviets would beat us to the moon so we decided to fake the moon landings of Apollo 11 to say we were greater than the Soviets"" concluded Buzz.:Shortly thereafter links and excerpts referencing this article were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered the item mistaking it for a genuine news report. However, that article was just a spoof from Huzlers, a web site that offers users the ability to ""Create your own news prank and trick your friends by sharing it"" and has a history of publishing fabricated news stories (such as one about pop star Justin Bieber's admitting to being bisexual and one about the 2014 Super Bowl being rigged). The Huzlers site also carries a disclaimer on its pages noting that ""Huzlers.com is a combination of real shocking news and satire news to keep its visitors in a state of disbelief.""

517,517,273.HillaryClintonHireda,"Claim:Hillary Clinton ""hired"" a child actor to be ""planted"" in the audience during a Town Hall campaign event.Rating:UnprovenAbout this rating What's TrueBrennan Leach, a 15-year-old who asked Hillary Clinton a question during a Town Hall event in Haverford, Pennsylvania, once played a small part in a short film.What's FalseThere's no evidence that Brennan was ""hired"" by the Clinton campaign and ""planted"" in the audience with a specific question to ask during the Town Hall event.  :On 5 October 2016, a video published to YouTube advanced the conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton had been ""caught"" using a hired child actor who was ""planted"" in the audience of a Town Hall campaign event in Haverford, Pennsylvania, to lead off by asking the candidate a pointedly anti-Trump question:Hillary has no shame; she used a 15 year old child actor (Brennan Leach) to further her anti-Trump narrative. What kind of role model is Hillary for women teaching teenage girls that cheating is an acceptable form of winning?:This video was picked up by several web sites known for promulgating conspiracy theories, such as Info Wars and Zero Hedge:At a Hillary Clinton town hall yesterday in Haverford, Pennsylvania, a 15 year old girl was supposedly ""chosen at random"" to ask a question of the former Secretary of State.  But, the well-scripted performance raised some suspicion with a YouTuber named Spanglevision who decided to dig a little deeper.  And, wouldn't you know it, the ""random"" participant was none other than child actor, Brennan Leach, whose father just happens to be Pennsylvania democratic State Senator Daylin Leach.  Oh, and in case it wasn't obvious, Daylin supports Hillary for president ... shocking.Here is the full analysis from Spanglevision.  Among other things, he points out that Brennan is the only participant of the night who reads her question from a prepared script.As is common with most conspiracy theories, the narrative was based on a few realities. Brennan Leach is -- or at least was -- a child actress (if having a small part in a single short film qualifies one as a ""child actress""), she is the daughter of Pennsylvania state senator Daylin Leach, and she appears to have been the only audience member called upon who read her question from a piece of paper.:While these three facts were presented as ""evidence"" that Clinton was ""caught"" using a child actress to ask a pre-arranged question, that conclusion was based on nothing more than speculationIt's certainly likely that young Brennan Leach's political views have been informed by her parents, it's possible she received a prominent seat at the town hall event (making her more visible and more likely to be chosen for a question) because of her father's political prominence in the state, and it's not unreasonable to assume that her father talked to her before the event (and possibly even suggested a question for her to ask).But if the Clinton campaign had truly cast about for a ""child actor"" to ask a pre-arranged anti-Trump question, they likely would have hired one with a stronger resume than a single bit part in a short film, selected an actor who could recite a question without having to read it from a ""script,"" and coached their choice not to offer her real full name (thereby subjecting the whole plot to exposure by anyone familiar with the Internet Movie Database).:In short, the only aspect of this claim that suggests a conspiracy is the counterintuitive assertion that it was so easy to uncover.Steve Hoenstine, Senator Leach's Director of Communications, denied that Brennan was a paid actor, calling the attacks against the 15-year-old ""disgusting"":She wrote the question, got to ask it to Hillary Clinton and she answered it. It was a great moment for her. And since then this 15 year-old girl has been the subject of vile attacks, thousands of them. It's disgusting."
518,518,203.IsBeyoncéanItalianWo,"Claim:Music artist Beyonce is really an Italian woman named Ann Marie Lastrassi. Rating:FalseAbout this rating On July 4, 2020, Florida congressional candidate KW Miller took to Twitter with a mind-blowing (if true) revelation: Famous music artist Beyonce is ""not even African American."" Rather, Miller wrote, she was an Italian woman named Ann Marie Lastrassi::This wasn't the first ridiculous rumor Miller promoted. A self-described conservative, Miller appears to use Twitter trolling and promoting conspiracy theories as a tactic to attract attention to his congressional campaign.Before we look at the origins of this bizarre theory, let's take a glance at Beyonce's family tree.:Beyonce was born to Black parents, Tina and Mathew Knowles, in September 1981. Beyond that, her ancestry can be traced back to her great-great-great-grandmother, Rosalie Jean Louis, a slave who was born in Louisiana in 1800, and Joseph Lacey, a wealthy white merchant and Louis' reported slave owner. In 2018, Beyonce revealed to Vogue that she was the descendant of a slave and a slave owner (emphasis ours):I come from a lineage of broken male-female relationships, abuse of power, and mistrust. Only when I saw that clearly was I able to resolve those conflicts in my own relationship. Connecting to the past and knowing our history makes us both bruised and beautiful.I researched my ancestry recently and learned that I come from a slave owner who fell in love with and married a slave. I had to process that revelation over time. I questioned what it meant and tried to put it into perspective. I now believe it's why God blessed me with my twins. Male and female energy was able to coexist and grow in my blood for the first time. I pray that I am able to break the generational curses in my family and that my children will have less complicated lives.:Beyonce's true ancestry aside, Miller's claim doesn't make sense from a logical standpoint.Beyonce has been in the public eye for more than two decades. So what's more believable? That philanthropist George Soros found an Italian singer, changed her name, brought her to America, found two Black people to pretend to be her parents, found her a spot in the musical group Destiny's Child, waited for her to become a successful solo artist, and then, after more than 20 years of deceitful patience, got her to insert subliminal messaging into her songs about a New World Order? Or, that Beyonce is a successful Black woman with a voice all her own?Regardless, the idea that Beyonce is actually an Italian woman named Ann Marie Lastrassi is not supported by any evidence.In fact, this rumor was popularized by a tongue-in-cheek Twitter thread mocking a single comment in an Instagram post. In June 2020, the Instagram account Lawlessbey posted two photographs of Beyonce along with a compliment about how the singer still looked youthful. An Instagram user then commented on this post that Beyonce was actually an Italian woman::This single comment (since deleted) appears to be the basis of this rumor. This comment was not accompanied by any evidence to support this claim, and this news has not been reported or corroborated by any credible source. In fact, we weren't able to find any sources (credible or otherwise) making this claim prior to JJwwebb's post. :On June 22, the @Barcarvs Twitter account popularized this theory in a joke thread mocking the conspiracy theory::It should be noted that the hashtags at the bottom of Miller's tweet relate to the ""QAnon"" or ""Q"" movement, built on an unwieldy, nonsensical, ever-evolving collection of unfounded rumors that, more or less, claim that a ""deep state"" cabal of Satan-worshiping, cannibalistic pedophiles is working to undermine U.S. President Donald Trump. This movement came to prominence in part thanks to the debunked ""Pizzagate"" conspiracy theory and has spawned dozens of offshoot theories. For instance, some proponents of Q believe COVID-19 coronavirus disease is spreading via 5G towers (false). Although these conspiracy theories are outlandish at best, QAnon references have started to pop up in the feeds of some opportunistic politicians.One of the apparent problems with QAnon is that it revolves around rumors of uncertain origin that often touch on barely believable topics. This makes it difficult (as seen above) to tell the difference between jokes that mock Q-like conspiracy theories and posts that actually attempt to further these ideas in earnest.  "

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.A bioengineered virus, a genetic mutation induced by 5G technology, a big pharma conspiracy, a plot single-handedly masterminded by Bill Gates or Georges Soros. Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, conspiracy theories have spread like the virus itself.The whiff of conspiracy that inevitably seems to trail pandemics is nothing new. When the 1918 flu pandemic hit the Americas, it was blamed on German submarines spreading the virus. During the 1630 plague in Milan, the combination of folk superstitions and widespread anxiety led to the trial, torture and execution of two citizens falsely accused of spreading the pestilence - a case minutely examined by the Italian novelist Alessandro Manzoni. In his work on witchcraft, Carlo Ginzburg tells of persecutions against lepers and Jews in 14th century France. According to some chronicles, rumour had it that the Jews, acting on behalf of the Muslim prince of Grenada, had bribed the lepers so they would contaminate public fountains and wells in order to kill the Christians. Clearly, contemporary tales of viral bioweapons build upon a very old theme.:Like conspiracy theories, pandemics are about an invisible and powerful enemy hiding among us. Like pandemics, conspiracy theories are contagious or, as we say today, ""viral"". But beyond these superficial similarities, they are connected by deeper affinities.The great plague of Milan in 1630 spawned talk of conspiracy.Wellcome Collection, CC BYApocalypse nowPandemics are surrounded by a sense of impending apocalypse. Throughout history, they have been understood as final tribulations, a sign of the end time. In 1523, during a plague outbreak, while the richest inhabitants of Florence had scrambled for their countryside villas, those who had remained in the city were barricaded in their homes and trying to make sense of their predicament. Florentine statesman Niccolo Machiavelli, who witnessed the episode first hand, observed::Many are looking for the cause behind this affliction, some say the predictions of the astrologists threaten us, others that the prophets had predicted it; there are those who remember some prodigy ... so that everyone concludes that not only the plague, but an infinite number of other calamities are to befall us.Today, only religious fundamentalists interpret the coronavirus pandemic as an omen of the final judgement or end times. Yet, apocalyptic thinking does not necessarily have to be religious or to countenance the end of earthly existence. Italian anthropologist Ernesto de Martino proposed the idea of ""cultural apocalypses"" to designate the sense that a specific historical world is ending. For de Martino and his contemporaries in the mid-20th century, this manifested itself in the sense of existential crisis permeating post-war culture and in the actual possibility of atomic annihilation, but he intended the notion to apply to a wide range of historical situations. We are living through such a cultural apocalypse today, as it becomes increasingly clear that the world as we know it is fast becoming a thing of the past and that whatever lies ahead will be utterly different. We have become the quarantined spectators of an unfolding catastrophe that underscores the frailty of the world we took for granted and of our own presence in it. :When paranoia prevailsThe impression that the world is dissolving and our impotence to stop this can make us feel a paralysing anxiety, incompatible with any productive form of social and cultural life. For de Martino, ancient mythologies, religions and even progressive secular cultures have contained this risk by emphasising a future around which a community could exist.Without this, the apocalyptic experience becomes totally alienating. When all the certainties grounding our existence are shaken, it is easy to feel paranoid. Or, as de Martino put it, to sense hostile forces and feel victim of ""conspiracies, machinations, curses"". Conspiracy theories and paranoid visions are the flipside of a cultural crisis in which the idea of a shared future has collapsed.In an earlier work, de Martino observed that extreme situations of ""suffering and deprivation"" could trigger such existential crises. He mentioned wars, but he might as well have added pandemics. Self-isolation and quarantine epitomise the idea of being removed from the world and any sense of community. In these conditions it is easy to succumb to paranoia, especially if it is stirred up by cynical and reactionary politicians. :Unlike religious ideas of apocalypse, the secular version of conspiracy theories offers no element of redemption. Conspiracy theories perpetuate the paranoid sense of disaffection and powerlessness - the idea that evil forces are at work, which one has little power to stop. They further isolate people and deprive them of feeling that they can shape their own world, let alone make it a better one. The political culture of the past 50 years has failed to offer the vast majority of people a sense of their own worthiness and to protect them against the existential risk of losing their livelihoods - indeed, their world. The current pandemic pushes us into the terminal phase of this crisis. The only way out consists of turning apocalyptic ideas on their head and ensuring that the end we are witnessing will not be an endless agony but a new beginning.:Nicolas Guilhot, Senior Research Associate, CNRS and Visiting Professor, City College of New YorkThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

This is actually a circuit board from an old set-top television box. The word ""COV-19"" is also inauthentic.:The above-displayed video deals with a widespread (and repeatedly debunked) conspiracy theory that the COVID-19 coronavirus disease was being spread by 5G cellular towers. This is not true.This conspiracy theory is a blend of two other false notions about mobile technology and the COVID-19 global pandemic. First, some people have been expressing concern over the impact of mobile technology on human health for years. These concerns are largely overblown, however, as research from such entities as the World Health Organization has shown that ""no adverse health effect has been causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies."" Second, a number of conspiracy theories concerning the origins of COVID-19 have been floated since the beginning of the pandemic, including the far-fetched idea that the disease was a ""bio-weapon."" This, again, is not true. At some point, conspiracy theorists started to tap into general fears about mobile technology in order to spread unfounded rumors about the spread of COVID-19.

At one point, for instance, the name of the company that actually manufactured this device (Hannstar) can be seen:::Hannstar does not manufacture 5G equipment. Hannstar is a Taiwan-based company that makes television parts and computer monitors.

It has absolutely no relation with any mobile network infrastructure, including that used for 5G.""In addition to the word ""Hannstar"" being visible on this device and a Virgin Media spokesperson identifying this item as an old TV circuit board, this board also features ports related to television, not mobile technology, such as a SCART plug, a 21-pin connector for connecting pieces of audio-visual equipment:::In sum, this video does not show ""COV-19"" inscribed on a piece of 5G equipment but rather a person holding an old circuit board for a television that had ""COV-19"" added to it.

522,522,3.Howthe5GCoronavirusC,"This article is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.In times of crisis, conspiracy theories can spread as fast as a virus. As the coronavirus pandemic tightened its grip on a world which struggled to comprehend the enormity of the situation it was facing, darker forces were concocting their own narratives. Scientists and researchers were working - and continue to work - around the clock for answers. But science is slow and methodical. So far-fetched explanations about how the outbreak started began filling the vacuum. Among these strange explanations is a theory that the recent rollout of 5G technology is to blame. But where did this theory begin, how did it develop and mutate and what can be done to stem the tide of fake news? We asked four experts who have all done extensive research in this area to examine these questions.:Marc Tuters, assistant professor of new media and digital cultureat the University of Amsterdam, and Peter Knight, professor of American studies at the University of Manchester, examine the big questions and the history of conspiracy theories. Then Wasim Ahmed, lecturer in digital business at Newcastle University, and Joesph Downing, a nationalism research fellow at the London School of Economics, share the results of their new study into the origins of the 5G conspiracy theory on social media.A toxic cocktail of misinformationMarc Tuters and Peter KnightConspiracy theories about mobile phone technology have been circulating since the 1990s, and have long historical roots. Doctors first talked of ""radiophobia"" as early as 1903. Following on from fears about power lines and microwaves in the 1970s, opponents of 2G technology in the 1990s suggested that radiation from mobile phones could cause cancer, and that this information was being covered up. Other conspiracy theories about 5G include the idea that it was responsible for the unexplained deaths of birds and trees. The coronavirus 5G conspiracy theory comes in several different strains, of varying degrees of implausibility.:One of the first versions of the theory claimed that it was no coincidence that 5G technology was trialled in Wuhan, where the pandemic began (this is incorrect, as 5G was already being rolled out in number of locations). Some claim that the coronavirus crisis was deliberately created in order to keep people at home while 5G engineers install the technology everywhere. Others insist that 5G radiation weakens people's immune systems, making them more vulnerable to infection by COVID-19. Another mutation of the 5G conspiracy theory asserts that 5G directly transmits the virus. These different 5G stories are often combined together with other COVID-19 conspiracy theories into a toxic cocktail of misinformation.At first, some conspiracy theorists insisted that the threat of the virus (and the apparent death rates) had been exaggerated. Echoing President Donald Trump's own language, some of his supporters considered this as part of an elaborate ""hoax"" intended to harm his chances of re-election. Others, particularly on the far right in the US, framed lockdown emergency measures in terms of ""Deep State"" efforts at controlling the population and called for a ""second civil war"" in response. :Researchers in a lab at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, China, in February 2017.EPA-EFE/SHEPHERD HOU CHINA OUTOther prominent theories include the claim that the virus was accidentally released by the Wuhan Institute of Virology, or that it was deliberately made as a biowarfare weapon, either by the Chinese or the Americans. One increasingly popular idea is that the pandemic is part of a plan by global elites like Bill Gates or George Soros - in league with Big Pharma - to institute mandatory worldwide vaccinations that would include tracking chips, which would then be activated by 5G radiowaves.Polling data in various countries including the UK, the US, France, Austria and Germany has shown that the most popular coronavirus conspiracy theory is that the virus was man-made - 62% of respondents in the UK think that this theory is true to some degree. In that UK poll, 21% agreed, to varying extents, that coronavirus is caused by 5G and is a form of radiation poisoning transmitted through radiowaves. In comparison, 19% agreed that Jews have created the virus to collapse the economy for financial gain.Where did these theories come from?:Few of these theories are new. Most of them are mutations or re-combinations of existing themes, often drawing on narrative tropes and rhetorical manoeuvres that have a long history. Conspiracy theorists usually have a complete worldview, through which they interpret new information and events, to fit their existing theory. Indeed, one of the defining characteristics of conspiracy thinking is that it is self-sealing, unfalsifiable and resistant to challenge. The absence of evidence is, ironically, often taken as evidence of a massive cover up.The dismissal of the pandemic as a hoax and the questioning of scientific experts is straight out of the playbook of climate change denial. The 5G theory about radiowaves transmitting or activating the virus, for example, is a reworking of long running conspiracy fears about mind control experiments, subliminal messaging and supposed secret US military weapons projects (all ripe topics for Hollywood's movie industry).The 5G story shares similarities with rumours that date back to the 1990s about HAARP (the US military's High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program). HAARP was a large radio transmitter array located in Alaska and funded by the US Department of Defence, in conjunction with a number of research universities. The programme conducted experiments into the ionosphere (the upper layer of the atmosphere) using radio waves, and was closed down in 2014. Conspiracy theorists, however, claimed that it was actually developing a weapon for weather control as well as mind control. Similarly, concerns have been expressed concerning that 5G might be in fact be a hi-tech weapon whose use represents an ""existential threat to humanity"". :There have also long been conspiracy rumours that Big Pharma is suppressing a cure for cancer. The idea that the virus was made in a lab mirrors claims made a quarter of a century ago about HIV/AIDS. One origin for that story was an early example of a KGB disinformation campaign. The allegation that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation or George Soros planned the coronavirus pandemic is a version of familiar right-wing (and often racist and antisemitic) conspiracy fantasies about ""globalist"" elites threatening national and individual sovereignty. There is mounting evidence that far-right groups are opportunistically using fear and uncertainty surrounding the pandemic to promote their hateful politics.Populist conspiracy theories often work by dividing the world into Us vs Them, with the aim of scapegoating people and institutions and providing simple explanations for complex phenomena. The 5G coronavirus conspiracy theories are particularly challenging because they bring together people from very different parts of the political spectrum. On the one hand, they attract the far-right who see them as part of a technological assault by big government on the freedom of individuals. On the other, they appeal to the well established anti-vaxxer community, who are often allied with those distrustful of Big Pharma. :In the US, which is in an election year, coronavirus mitigation strategies have become a divisive culture war issue, with the president refusing to wear a face mask. But in countries like Germany anti-lockdown issues appear to be creating connections across the political spectrum, led by social media influencers who are working to connect the dots between previously separate conspiracy theory communities or tribes. As seen in the quantitative analysis below, such influencers anchor conspiracy theory communities on social media. Because these methods provide only a partial view, it is problematic to assume that the members of these communities are necessarily trapped within echo chambers, unable to access other points of view. Nevertheless the findings do correspond with the troubling patterns outlined above. And they also show that those who believe in and propagate conspiracy theories can come from a cross section of society. :Social network analysisWasim Ahmed and Joseph DowningOur study set out to investigate the 5G conspiracy theory on Twitter towards the beginning of April 2020 which was when the conspiracy was trending in the UK and increasing its visibility. This time period coincided with reports that at least 20 UK 5G phone masts were vandalised, including damage reported at a hospital. There were also 5G arson attacks across continental Europe during this time.  Our research set out to uncover who was spreading the conspiracy theory, the percentage of users who believed the theory and what steps were needed to combat it. We used a tool called NodeXL to carry out a social network analysis. NodeXL is a Microsoft Excel plugin which can be used to retrieve data from a number of social media platforms such as Twitter. :We captured data using the ""5Gcoronavirus"" keyword which also retrieved tweets with the #5GCoronavirus hashtag. Tweets we analysed were posted from March 27 to April 4. The network consisted of a total of 10,140 tweets, which are composed of 1,938 mentions, 4,003 retweets, 759 mentions in retweets, 1,110 replies, and 2,328 individual tweets.We found that there was a specific Twitter account, set up as @5gcoronavirus19 with 383 followers, which was spreading the conspiracy theory and had become influential in driving it forward on social media. The account was able to send out 303 tweets in seven days. We also found that President Trump was often tagged in tweets and was influential within the network without having tweeted himself. This highlights the point about support for these theories coming from the alt-right.Out of a total of 2,328 individual tweets, 34.8% of users believed the theory and/or shared views in support of it. For example, one user who we are not identifying due to the ethics on which our study was based tweeted: 5G Kills! #5Gcoronavirus - they are linked! People don't be blind to the truth!:But 32% denounced the theory or mocked it. For instance, one user noted: ""5G is not harming or killing a single person! COVID-19 #5Gcoronavirus"".A further 33% were just general tweets not expressing any personal views or opinions. Like one user who tweeted: ""I have a 10AM Skype Chat on Monday, COVID-19 #5Gcoronavirus"". But this overt lack of support for the conspiracy itself became a problem because as more users joined the discussion, the profile of the topic was raised which allowed it to start trending. Network clustersOur social network graph shows the different groups within a network.Author providedWe created a social network graph (above), clustering identified different shapes and structures within the network. The largest group in the network represented an ""isolates group"". These groups are typically formed when a user mentions a hashtag in their tweets without mentioning another user. Big brands, sports events and breaking news stories will all have a sizeable isolates group. This suggests that during this time the conspiracy topic had become popular and attracted views and opinions from users who were new to the network. :The second largest network shape resembled a ""broadcast"" network and contained users that were being retweeted. Broadcast networks can typically be found in the Twitter feeds of celebrities and journalists. The Twitter handle @5gcoronavirus19, which was set up to spread the theory, formed a group of its own resembling a broadcast network shape and it received a number of retweets, showing how the conspiracy theory was being amplified as users retweeted content. Conspiracy theorists are likely to use comments made by influential figures which can add fuel to the fire. A key example of this would be when the television presenter Eamon Holmes said the media couldn't say for sure whether the 5G theory was false. These comments fell outside of the time period we studied. But they are likely to have had an impact across social media platforms. Holmes was strongly criticised by Ofcom which noted that his comments risked undermining the public's faith in science.The misinformation pandemic:Months before mobile phone masks were attacked in the UK, the ""infodemic"" (a wide and rapid spread of misinformation) was unfolding at a rapid pace. In France, news spread on Facebook of a tasty cure for the virus: Roquefort cheese. Indeed, a far more dangerous public health prospect than blue cheese, the rumour that cocaine could cure COVID-19 caused the French Ministry of Health to release a warning statement.Some argue that strange events like this, which erupt from the online world of fake news, memes and misinformation, effectively delivered Trump the US presidency. Given that a survey showed 75% of Americans believed fake news during that election, this claim is not as outrageous as it initially sounds. But there is another theory. Rather than social media activity leading to direct ""real world"" action, the reverse could be true. For example, a major event like the Arab Spring was a real world action that caused a ripple effect across social media.:Dark forces are still at work on the internet during major events. They seek to spread a fake news agenda and change the way events are perceived and constructed in dangerous ways. Our other research, carried out with Richard Dron from the University of Salford, examined the depictions of Muslims during the Grenfell fire and tracked how Grenfell was covered on Twitter as the fire still burned in the early hours of June 14, 2017. In the following days both celebrities and politicians would be reprimanded for spreading distrust about official accounts of the fire.A strong denunciation of the 5G and COVID-19 conspiracy from a world leader, when it surfaced, would have helped in mitigating the effect of the theory on the public. But during this time Boris Johnson, the UK's prime minister, was himself sick with COVID-19. So was there was no direct rebuttal from him. Although this would have helped we believe the fight should ideally take place on the platform on which the conspiracy is shared. Our ongoing work on fitness influencers demonstrates how popular culture figures with large followings on Twitter and other social media platforms can sometimes have more of an appeal - and be more believable - than ""official"" accounts or politicians. That is why we believe that governments and health authorities should draw on social media influencers in order to counteract misinformation. :It is also important to note which websites people were sharing around this time, as they are likely to play a key role in the spread and existence of the theory. Unsurprisingly, ""fake news"" websites such as InfoWars published a number of articles which indicated that there was a link between COVID-19 and 5G technologies. YouTube also appeared as an influential domain, as Twitter users linked to various videos which were spreading the theory.Worryingly, our study found that a small number of Twitter users were happy to see footage posted of 5G masts being damaged and hoped for more to be attacked. Twitter has been taking action and blocking users from sharing 5G conspiracy theories on the platform. YouTube has also been banning content that contains medical misinformation. It has not been easy for social media platforms to keep up as the pandemic has given rise over ten different conspiracy theories. One way the public can join the fight against conspiracy theories is to report inappropriate and/or dangerous content on social media platforms and - more importantly - avoid sharing or engaging with them. Meanwhile the mainstream media on public television, newspapers and radio should be doing its part by discussing and dispelling conspiracy theories as they arise.:But social media platforms, citizens and governments need to work together with experts to regain trust and debunk the deluge of fake news and ever evolving theories.MutationsMarc Tuters and Peter KnightThe viral conspiracy video, Plandemic is a key example as it has helped coronavirus conspiracy theories spread even more widely into the mainstream. The video - which briefly went viral on YouTube and Facebook until it was taken down - focused on a discredited virologist who promotes the theory that the coronavirus pandemic was a Big Pharma plot to sell vaccines. Although such conspiracy theories are less widespread than the torrent of coronavirus misinformation that is being catalogued and debunked by media watchdog groups, what is particularly concerning is how they are mutating and combining into novel and potentially dangerous forms as different tribes converge and encroach in the mainstream with slick videos involving ""real"" experts.:With coronavirus, existing 5G conspiracy theories have indeed become supercharged, leading for instance to new protest movements such as the ""hygiene protests"" in Germany. In these protests, unfamiliar configurations of left and right-wing activists are finding common cause in their shared indignance towards lockdown protocols.In the past several years Deep State conspiracy theories like Pizzagate and QAnon first developed within reactionary ""deep web"" communities before spreading into the mainstream, where they were amplified by disinformation bots, social media influencers, celebrities, and politicians. Thriving communities have grown up around these theories, clustered around conspiracy theory entrepreneurs. A significant number of these figures, with some notable exceptions, have pivoted to interpret the coronavirus pandemic through their particular conspiratorial lens. With coronavirus as a common strand connecting these various tribes, the result has been a cross-fertilisation of ideas. Such hybridised conspiracy theories appear to be popping up across all points of the political spectrum and of the web, in contrast to previous cases when they emerged primarily from the margins and spread to the mainstream. :Social media platforms are taking actions against fake news.Shutterstock/VasinLeeIn comparison with previous outbursts of fake news, social media platforms have responded quite proactively to the abundance of coronavirus-related problematic information. Google, for example, curates coronavirus-related search results, meaning that they only return authoritative sources and feature links to those sources where s would usually have appeared.Platforms have also been much more willing to delete problematic trending content, as with the case of the Plandemic video which YouTube removed within 24 hours - although not before it had reached 2.5 million views. While this kind of banned content inevitably migrates to an ""alternative social media ecology"" of sites like Bitchute and Telegram, their much smaller audience share diminishes the reach of these conspiracy theories as well as undermining the revenue streams of their entrepreneurs.In an era in which public distrust of institutions and suspicion of elites is one of the contributing factors in the global rise of national populism, the communication of authoritative knowledge is undoubtedly a challenge for governments. :In this time of enormous uncertainty, capable and honest leadership is one of the only truly effective measures which will help manage the spread of coronavirus misinformation and politicians should be putting party allegiances to one side while confronting the problem. For everyone else this means accepting that short term solutions are unlikely and that people should trust the experts, think before sharing social media content and care for one another.

Marjorie Taylor Greene said, ""Well, like a lot of people today, I had easily gotten sucked into some things I had seen on the internet.""Rating:Correct AttributionAbout this rating U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has long been known for her controversial statements and her vocal support for QAnon, an internet conspiracy theory that far-right movements widely embrace. But in an interview on Jan. 8, 2023, she appeared to be distancing herself from that history, while admitting to being influenced by QAnon. :According to a viral clip, Greene said in response to a question on Fox News about her past with QAnon, ""Well, like a lot of people today, I had easily gotten sucked into some things I had seen on the internet.""This is correctly attributed to her. Television host Howard Kurtz brought up how Greene had been stripped of her House committee assignments back in February 2021. This occurred after public outrage over her history of racist, anti-Semitic comments (among others) and her apparent support for violence against Democrats. :The interview can be found on Fox News here, and the exchange takes place at the 5:13 mark. Kurtz said, ""That was raw politics,"" and added, ""But in fairness, didn't you also say around that period that you had been a follower of QAnon conspiracy theories, and you had rethought this and you were no longer influenced by the group?""Greene responded with, ""Well, like a lot of people today, I had easily gotten sucked into some things I had seen on the internet. But that was dealt with quickly early on. I never campaigned on those things. That was not something I believed in. That's not what I ran for Congress on. So, those are so far in the past."" Kurtz did not ask her to elaborate. Back in 2021 when she was stripped of her House committee assignments, she said her past comments about QAnon ""do not represent me"" and she was ""was allowed to believe things that weren't true [...]."" She added that she regretted that she ""would ask questions about them and talk about them."":QAnon was once a fringe phenomenon now embraced by many members of the far-right. They believe that former U.S. President Donald Trump is in the middle of a biblical war against a ""deep state,"" satanic cabal of baby-eating, child sex-traffickers led by prominent members of the Democratic party, entertainers who espouse liberal opinions, anybody who mentions ""pizza,"" and authoritative sources who relay credible information that may cast a negative light on the president.But even while a lawmaker, Greene has said she doesn't believe in evolution, and has spread COVID-19 misinformation, among other controversies.

Or so the story goes.According to Space.com, the ""Black Knight"" conspiracy theory goes like this: For about 12,000 years, an alien satellite orbited Earth, surveilling humanity. It was discovered about 120 years ago, but was the subject of a cover-up.:Then in 2017, UFO conspiracy theorists claimed, it was shot down by the Illuminati, a clandestine group they believe secretly controls the world.The ""Black Knight"" satellite conspiracy theory continues to get attention online. Here's one example, posted to Twitter on Jan. 3, 2022, with the user's name cropped out for privacy::If there really is an alien craft orbiting Earth and it's the subject of a cover-up, the government is doing a very bad job of it, considering the images that catalyzed the conspiracy theory were taken and shared by NASA. And contrary to what the above post says, the origin of the object in question is known.We will explain more below, but the object is essentially space junk, and it wasn't shot down, it burned in Earth's atmosphere.According to a debunking of the conspiracy theory published by James Oberg, a former NASA engineer, the image was taken during STS-88, the first shuttle mission to the International Space Station in 1998. The crew of the space shuttle Discovery was sent to space to help assemble the space station.During a space walk in which astronauts were placing thermal covers over trunnion pins, one of the blankets came loose and, to the dismay of the astronauts, drifted away into space.

One of the victims, Logan Turner, quickly became the target of an online hoax.Turner had just turned 30 and was out with friends in the Oregon District, a nightlife spot in Dayton, when he and eight others fell victim to the second of two deadly mass shootings in a single weekend in the U.S. The Dayton massacre occurred the day after a mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, which claimed 22 lives.:Shortly after the Ohio tragedy, a Facebook user going by the name ""Jerry Jerry"" posted a political message supportive of President Donald Trump while claiming to be Turner's brother. ""Jerry Jerry"" also launched a GoFundMe online crowdfunding campaign, which is no longer active.Per an obituary published by the funeral home handling Turner's memorial services, Turner is not survived by a brother or any family member by the name of ""Jerry."":GoFundMe suspended the campaign launched by ""Jerry Jerry,"" citing the need for further information about the creator's connection to Turner's family. ""When a campaign is created, we work the campaign organizers to ensure the money is transferred to the right place,"" GoFundMe spokeswoman Meghan Scripture told us in an email.The ""Jerry Jerry"" Facebook page that created the post above is also no longer in use; Facebook did not respond to our questions about whether the platform took any action against the user.The questionable Facebook page and GoFundMe fundraiser got a signal boost when pro-Trump internet personality Jack Posobiec posted them to his Facebook page, stating that ""Jerry Jerry"" was a ""friend"" of his social media moderator. The posts on Posobiec's profile have since been deleted, but screenshots have continued to circulate.:When reached for comment via Twitter, Posobiec acknowledged that his social media moderator, Meredith Wynne-Morton, had made a mistake by sharing the posts, and that ""Jerry Jerry"" was not her personal ""friend"" but just a Facebook profile she had accepted a friend request from. Posobiec sent us screenshots in which he informed his Facebook fans that Wynne-Morton ""takes full responsibility"" for ""being suckered.""Posobiec has been a prominent figure in high-profile public misinformation campaigns in the past.

528,528,503.WasanOmicronMovieMad,"Claim:An ""Omicron"" movie was made in the 1960s. Rating:MixtureAbout this rating What's TrueIn 1963, an Italian satirical sci-fi comedy movie called ""Omicron"" was released. What's FalseA movie poster for ""The Omicron Variant"" is doctored; the 1963 movie ""Omicron"" did not predict the COVID-19 pandemic.:The only thing the internet loves more than a good prediction is pretending that a good prediction exists. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we've seen some far-reaching attempts to claim that this contagious and deadly disease had been predicted by episodes of ""The Simpsons,"" George Orwell's book ""1984,"" the alleged soothsayer known as Nostradamus, alleged psychic Sylvia Browne, South Korean television shows, the video game Resident Evil, and a novel by Dean Koontz. In November 2021, as a new variant of COVID-19 emerged that health officials called ""omicron,"" social media users started looking for old pieces of media containing the word so that they could claim that this variant had been ""predicted."" What they found was a movie from the 1960s:::There really was a movie made in 1963 called ""Omicron."" And that's where this movie's connection to the current COVID-19 pandemic ends. The word ""omicron"" isn't new, and it's use in a 1960s movie isn't all that surprising. ""Omicron"" is the 15th letter of the Greek alphabet and has been in use for thousands of years. In academic fields, it is often used to represent the 15th item in a list.The World Health Organization announced in May that it would be naming new COVID-19 variants as they emerge by using the the Greek alphabet. While the ""delta"" variant made headlines, there have been several other variants, such as epsilon, Iota and lambda, that didn't warrant too much concern. When the latest variant emerged, WHO skipped two letters, nu and xi, as they are common surnames, and named the new variant omicron. WHO has assigned simple, easy to say and remember labels for key variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, using letters of the Greek alphabet.These labels were chosen after wide consultation and a review of many potential naming systems. WHO convened an expert group of partners from around the world to do so, including experts who are part of existing naming systems, nomenclature and virus taxonomic experts, researchers and national authorities.:The word ""omicron"" is also frequently used by astronomers to name stars. Omicron Persei, Omicron Andromedae, and Omicron Ceti are all real stars in the galaxy. It's not far-fetched to see how a fiction writer could name a fictional planet or a fictional alien ""Omicron.""In fact, when some social media users encountered the name of this new COVID-19 variant, a number of people noted how ""omicron"" would make a great name for a sci-fi movie. Some even created and posted fake movie posters. Here's one fake ""Omicron"" movie poster (left) next to the original movie poster (right) it was created from::While a few fake ""Omicron"" movie posters were circulated on social media in November 2021, there really have been a few movies with this title. In 1963, Italian writer and director Ugo Gregoretti made a movie called ""Omicron"" about an alien that took over a human body in order to learn more about earth. Here's one scene from the satirical film::This is a real movie, but it has practically nothing to do with the current pandemic. Furthermore, using ""omicron"" in a work of fiction isn't all that uncommon. In 2013, ""The Visitor from Planet Omicron"" explored how an alien invasion could be thwarted by really good cooking. The plot of ""The Visitor from Planet Omicron"" would probably make better conspiratorial fodder as it involves a botanical virus and a corrupt government, but this low-budget comedy in no way ""predicted"" COVID-19. : The animated show ""Futurama"" also features an alien character named Lrrr who is the ruler of the Planet Omicron Persei 8. While one could build a conspiracy theory around Lrrr and the other Omicronians starting the COVID-19 pandemic, Lrrr would probably rather eat humans (or force them to make more sitcoms) than kill them with a plague. :Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic is not a work of fiction. It wasn't predicted by old sci-fi movies and it wasn't planned by nefarious forces. The latest variant was named ""omicron"" because that was the next usable letter in the Greek alphabet.The next variant will likely be called ""Pi,"" the 16th letter of the Greek alphabet, which will undoubtedly lead people to claim that the pandemic was predicted by movies like ""Life of Pi"" or by Greek mathematician Archimedes of Syracuse who was the first to calculate an accurate approximation of pi.

529,529,462.IsaNancyPelosiCrimeF,"Claim:A meme accurately describes 'The Nancy Pelosi Crime Family.'Rating:MixtureAbout this rating An image graphic supposedly documenting the various misdeeds of the ""Pelosi Crime Family"" -- including perjury, securities fraud, and simply being rich -- was circulated on social media in January 2019. We've examined each of the accusations leveled within against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, her husband, her father, her brother, and her son individually and found them to be largely overstated, misrepresented, or based on unreliable information::: Was Nancy Pelosi's father, Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr., a constant companion of Benjamin ""Benny Tratta"" Magliano?Status: UNPROVENThe facts: This claim is a verbatim reproduction of the introductory paragraph of a June 2015 blog post published on the Typepad blog ""Bitterqueen"" by Phillip Crawford, Jr., the author of the 2015 book The Mafia and the Gay, which was reportedly based on FBI files obtained pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).Crawford wrote that Peter Galiano, a boxer who was caught up in a draft-dodging scheme in the 1940s, told federal agents in 1947 that D'Alesandro was a ""constant companion"" of the Boston mobster. When the FBI examined these associations in 1961, however, before D'Alesandro received a presidential appointment to the Federal Renegotiation Board, Galiano said that his statements were based on rumor and hearsay and that he couldn't recall where he had come across that information::1947: Peter C. Galiano, Baltimore, Maryland, advised that Thomas D'Alesandro was a constant companion of John Cataneo, Benjamin Magliano, also known as Benny Trotta, and [redacted], who were described as ""local big-time gamblers."" Mr. Galiano stated that these individuals had worked hard for Thomas D'Alesandro's re-election to Congress and in his campaign at that time to become Mayor of Baltimore.Peter C. Galiano, Baltimore, Maryland, advised during the current investigation that his previous statements were based only on rumor and hearsay. He stated that he could not recall who gave him this information or whether or not there was any truth to the allegations. He further explained that he was never well acquainted with any of the men he had mentioned and had no personal knowledge of their affairs.Galiano wasn't the only person to accuse D'Alesandro of having ties to the Boston mob, but those allegations were never officially corroborated and they never resulted in any charges being brought against D'Alesandro. In fact, D'Alesandro was appointed to the Federal Renegotiation Board by President John F. Kennedy in 1961 despite an FBI investigation into those alleged associations.Does Nancy Pelosi own Goat Hill Pizza, a restaurant suspected of harboring trafficking?:Status: FALSEThe Facts: Nancy Pelosi does not own a pizza parlor, and Goat Hill Pizza is not suspected of harboring child trafficking by any law enforcement agencies.This claim first started circulating in 2016 as part of a larger nonsensical and repeatedly debunked conspiracy theory known as ""Pizzagate,"" in which online trolls asserted that innocuous words such as ""pizza"" and ""cheese"" were actually code words referring to child sex trafficking. Although this conspiracy theory was largely focused on the Washington, D.C,. pizza parlor ""Comet Ping Pong,"" Pelosi was also accused of running her own pedophilia ring back in San Francisco out of Goat Hill Pizza.Why? Because a single document from 2004 listed ""Philip@GoatHill.com"" as the email address for Nancy Pelosi. While conspiracy theorists may contend that this tidbit of information is somehow proof that a high-profile politician was running a pedophilia ring out of the basement of a pizza parlor, a much more plausible (and far less sensational) explanation is evident: it was a filing error.:Philip DeAndrade co-founded Goat Hill Pizza in the 1970s, but by 1987 he was working on Nancy Pelosi's staff. It's likely that DeAndrade accidentally put his own email address, instead of Pelosi's, into a form. Regardless, one spurious appearance of an email address can in no way be construed as proof that Pelosi owns a pizza parlor. Furthermore, the only persons who have suspected this pizza parlor of facilitating child trafficking are online conspiracy theorists and not genuine law enforcement agencies.Did Nancy Pelosi hold a secret fundraiser for Islamist and Hamas-linked groups?Status: MIXTUREThe Facts: Despite the wording suggesting that Pelosi hosted a ""secret fundraiser"" to for Islamist- and Hamas-linked groups, this claim refers to a fundraiser held for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The ""Islamist and Hamas-linked groups"" portion of the claim is largely based on the fact that Nihad Awad, the co-founder of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), attended the fundraiser.:A number of other Muslim groups were also reportedly in attendance at the fundraiser, along with Keith Ellison, the first Muslim to be elected to the U.S. Congress.The Daily Caller was among the first to draw attention to Awad's attendance at this fundraiser:Democratic leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi headlined a high-dollar fundraiser in May that was attended by U.S.-based Islamist groups and individuals linked by the U.S. government to the Hamas jihad group and to the Egypt-based Muslim Brotherhood movement.The donors at the undisclosed May 16 event included Nihad Awad, the co-founder of the Council on American Islamic Relations, according to data provided by the nonpartisan Investigative Project on Terrorism.The CAIR group was named an unindicted conspirator in a 2007 trial of a Hamas money-smuggling group.:While it's true that CAIR was named as an unindicted co-conspirator during the 2007 case of the Holy Land Foundation (HLF), an Islamic charity eventually convicted of funding Islamic militant groups, CAIR was not charged with any criminal activity in connection with that case. Furthermore, CAIR was one of nearly 250 organizations who were given the ""unindicted co-conspirator"" label during the HLF case:CAIR is an aggressive Muslim civil liberties organization, modeled on the Anti Defamation League, that has made it a target for criticism. It was indeed named as an ""unindicted co-conspirator or joint venturer"" in the Holy Land Foundation case -- an Islamic charity that in 2008 was convicted of funding Islamic militant groups. But CAIR was not alone in that designation; nearly 250 other organizations and individuals were also named.The federal government said the organizations were included on the list in order to produce evidence at the trial, but the district court and a federal appeals court later ruled that it had been a mistake to make the list public.The New York Times also reported that ""unindicted co-conspirators"" on this list were not charged with any crimes::Technically, the prosecution can introduce statements made by any individual or organization named as an unindicted co-conspirator without such statements being dismissed as hearsay. Those on the list have not been charged with anything, but they are concerned that the label of unindicted co-conspirator will forever taint them, particularly if the Holy Land group is convicted, and that they will have no legal recourse.CAIR, of course, also denied having links to any terrorist organizations.So Pelosi and other Democrats held a Democratic fundraiser in 2012 that was attended by a number of leaders from various Muslim groups. While some critics may label groups such as CAIR as ""Hamas-linked,"" that label is disputed.Was Nancy Pelosi's son, Paul Pelosi, Jr., charged with securities fraud?Status: MOSTLY FALSE:The Facts: In July 2014, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced they were bringing fraud charges against four individuals involved with the company Natural Blue Resources Inc. Although Paul Pelosi, Jr. did work for that company, he was not one of the individuals charged with securities fraud by the SEC, who didn't even mention Pelosi Jr.'s name when they first announced the charges:The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against four individuals and a microcap company for concealing from investors that two lawbreakers ran the company.According to the SEC's orders instituting administrative proceedings, the mission of Natural Blue Resources Inc. was to create, acquire, or otherwise invest in environmentally-friendly companies, including an initiative to locate, purify, and sell water recovered from underground aquifers in New Mexico and other areas with depleting water resources. What investors didn't know was that two individuals with prior law violations -- James E. Cohen and Joseph Corazzi -- secretly controlled the operational and management decisions of Natural Blue while calling themselves outside ""consultants."":This arrangement enabled them to be de facto officers of Natural Blue and personally profit from the company without disclosing their past brushes with the law to investors. Cohen, who lives in Windermere, Fla., was previously incarcerated for financial fraud. Corazzi, who resides in Albuquerque, N.M., was previously charged with violating federal securities laws and permanently barred from acting as an officer or director of a public company ...The other two individuals charged in the case are Toney Anaya and Erik Perry, who were former chief executive officers at Natural Blue. The SEC's orders find that they misled investors by failing to disclose that Cohen and Corazzi were running the company in spite of their criminal or disciplinary histories.Subsequent SEC filings listed Paul Pelosi, Jr. as President and Board member of Natural Blue from 24 August 2009 to 10 January 2010. So Nancy Pelosi's son was involved with a company that was charged with securities fraud years later, he was never personally charged with a crime.Was Nancy Pelosi's brother, Franklin D. Roosevelt D'Alesandro, charged with lying during a rape trial?:Status: MIXTUREThe Facts: Nancy Pelosi's brother, Franklin D. Roosevelt D'Alesandro, was charged with perjury during a rape trial in the 1950s. However, he was eventually acquitted of those charges.In 1953, D'Alesandro and 13 other youths went on trial in Baltimore for ""moral charges"" involving two young girls, aged 11 and 14. D'Alesandro, who was 20 at the time and was charged with statutory rape, testified that he had never seen the victims before. Although he was eventually acquitted of the rape charges (he was the only defendant to be acquitted during the trials), he was later charged with perjury.The Denton Journal reported at the time that ""The perjury charge resulted from that trial. The state contended D'Alesandro lied in denying he had ever seen the girls before, or had been in a car with three other youths who testified at their trials he was with them."":Just as with the rape charges, however, D'Alesandro was eventually acquitted of the perjury charges:A jury of four women and eight men deliberated 6 hour and 16 minutes here last night before acquitting Franklin Roosevelt D'Alesandro, 21-year-old son of Baltimore's mayor, of a perjury charge. The ""not guilty"" verdict, delivered in a loud voice by Mrs. Stella B. Hughes, jury foreman, to a tension-taught crowd in Wicomico County Circuit Court, ended a 5-day trial.Young D'Alesandro, calm and poised throughout the long hours of testimony and argument and seemingly endless wait on the verdict, was jubilant when he heard the decision. After receiving a kiss on the hand from his fiancee and hugs and kisses from his crying mother, D'Alesandro planted a kiss on the cheek of Joseph Sherbow, former Baltimore Circuit Court judge, who headed the defense staff. It was Sherbow who successfully defended young D'Alesandro on a statutory rape charge in Baltimore last November when he was the only one of 16 defendents to be acquitted in a series of morals trials resulting from sex charges brought by two young girl cousins ..""In order to acquit this defendant,"" Asst. State's Atty. J Harold Grady said. ""You must be convinced these eight witness who appeared before you entered into a conspiracy and made up their story out of whole cloth."":The defense countered that the only evidence of contraindications came from a ""parade of trash."" Chief witness for the defense Mary Ann Jankowski, 20-year-old petite blonde fiancee of the defendant. She testified that at the time of the alleged sex offenses last July, young D'Alessandro spent every evening with her and her parents.Although it's possible that D'Alessandro's political power had something to do with his acquittal (whether directly or indirectly), the fact of the matter is that he was found not guilty of any crimes.Nancy Pelosi's husband Paul has a net worth of over $200 million?Status: UNPROVENThe Facts: Nancy Pelosi's husband Paul is indeed a successful businessman and investor, but the claim that he has a net worth of $202 million (which has nothing to do with criminal activity) appears to be based on a misreading of a 2015 article published by the National Review. The conservative publication reported at the time that Pelosi (not specifically her husband) listed assets worth between $43.4 million and $202 million on her 2014 financial disclosure forms::Though financial-disclosure forms list only ranges of assets and liabilities, Pelosi listed between $42.4 million and $199.5 million in assets in 2013, which was enough for Bloomberg Business to deem her the richest member of House leadership from either party. By 2014, she and her husband, investment banker Paul Pelosi, were doing even better: She reported between $43.4 million and $202 million in assets.The ""Pelosi Crime Family"" meme refers to the highest possible figure within a very broad range and incorrectly refers to this number as Pelosi's net worth. However, the figure actually states the estimated value of Pelosi's assets and doesn't offset it with other financial aspects such as debt:[T]he financial disclosures don't just show substantial assets -- the Pelosis have gone into lots of debt, too. Pelosi and her husband are currently paying mortgages on seven properties, totaling between approximately $9.8 million and $46.5 million in 2014, likely accruing big tax savings in the process. The couple also opened home-equity lines of credit on four of these properties, adding between approximately $1.7 million and $6.5 million to their liabilities.:A 2015 Politico article reported Pelosi's net worth at around $30 million."
530,530,591.TheseProDeSantisFace,"Politically themed Facebook pages and groups are in overdrive ahead of next month's U.S. midterm elections, with users sharing news and opinion in their discussions. However, how can readers know when such activity is authentic versus when posts are coming from coordinated inauthentic accounts? How can they be sure that the pages and groups they interact with don't include leaders who misrepresent both themselves and the facts? The truth is that, sometimes, it's really tough to tell.One such curious example was a network of Facebook fan groups that falsely claimed to be officially affiliated with Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla. Two of the groups displayed the names Ron DeSantis Campaign Headquarters and Ron DeSantis Official Support Page. One of three admin accounts for the network displayed an AI-generated profile picture. On top of that, none of the groups' admins appeared to have ever posted publicly viewable photographs of themselves.Additionally, we were unsuccessful at reaching anyone associated with the accounts or groups. We sent the admins multiple messages via Messenger, comments, and guest posts, and no one returned them. After we identified ourselves as reporters, the admins banned us from participating in the groups.:Given those signs, we had reason to question whether the accounts were operated by genuine people in support of DeSantis, who is seen as a potential 2024 presidential candidate, or were part of an effort to promote narratives that favor his political agenda using fake aliases. We shared findings of this investigation with Meta, the social media platform's parent company, and the company said the groups' and admins' activity didn't violate Facebook's guidelines.""We strive to strike the right balance between taking action against violating activities and ensuring we don't silence people sharing their views,"" Meta said in a statement. ""We will continue to enforce our policies and take action if we detect abuse of our platform.""The Network Includes a Random 'Downton Abbey' Fan GroupMost groups in the in-question network (i.e., a collection of Facebook pages or groups with the same admins) seemingly served as spaces to share, or create, content in support of DeSantis or right-wing talking points. However, one was dedicated to a popular television show for reasons that were suspiciously unclear.:Three pro-DeSantis groups showed a combined member count of more than 94,000 users. The largest group had 81,300 members and was named Ron DeSantis Campaign Headquarters. The other two were named Ron DeSantis Official Support Page and Ron DeSantis International Support Page. We found no indication that DeSantis or any of his team had anything to do with the groups.:Despite its name, this Facebook page appeared to have no affiliation with DeSantis.The admins were also in control of a fan group for the television series ""Downton Abbey."" That group's name was Downton Abbey International Facebook Group, with a user count of 6,600. The admins' posts about the show were simple, often doing little more than showing pictures of the cast and crew. Was the creation of the non-political group part of admins' efforts to appear authentic to American users? (The TV series saw soaring ratings during its initial run in the U.S.) The Downton Abbey group was one of several flags that led us to believe the network of Facebook groups, including the DeSantis pages, may be part of coordinated effort in which people, or entities, promote messages under fake identities.:Posts made by the three admins in the ""Downton Abbey"" group offered very little substance and were one of several pieces of evidence that led us to believe the groups may be part of an inauthentic network.We also located a fifth group, President Trump's Official Support Page, which had 1,300 members. It's unclear if additional groups were part of the network.Admins Haven't Posted Public Photos of ThemselvesThe groups' admins showed the names ""Ann Ambry,"" ""Kristen Lee,"" and ""Margaret Pawlak."" It's unclear if these names were real. Facebook's community standards require that users ""connect on Facebook using the name they go by in everyday life."" But the company's policies do not explicitly say that a birth name or legal name is required.From what we could tell, none of these three admins posted publicly available photographs of themselves. Instead, their profile pictures showed various images of American flags or a photograph of Highclere Castle, which is shown on ""Downton Abbey."":None of these three accounts ever appeared to host any publicly available pictures of the people who managed them.The oldest profile photographs on all three accounts were from either June or July 2020, which perhaps indicated that the accounts' activity increased following the May 2020 video-recorded murder of George Floyd. The aftermath of the murder was arguably a unique and turbulent moment on the subject of race in the U.S. (The topic of race had been wielded as a tool by foreign actors to create conflict ahead of previous U.S. elections.):A Potential Red Flag: AI-Generated Profile PicThe main admin in the Facebook network was ""Ann Ambry,"" with a bio: ""Hi. I'm Ann. Nice to meet you."" According to member data, this user created the groups.On June 21, 2021, the account posted a new profile picture that, based on visual clues, appeared to have been generated by artificial intelligence. (We've had some experience with this subject in the past.):This picture does not show a real person. We contacted an expert to receive confirmation. (Source: Facebook)We sent the profile picture to Giorgio Patrini, the founder and CEO of Sensity, a company that specializes in the creation of fraud-detection tools. (Sensity recently collaborated with Stanford University researchers to expose fake photographs on thousands of LinkedIn profiles that were used for sales-lead generation.) In Twitter messages with Snopes, Patrini confirmed that the ""Ann Ambry"" picture was fake. A scan of the photograph with Sensity's software revealed a 99.9% chance that it did not show a real person.:Patrini sent this screenshot of the scan, adding that features in the picture ""are very distinctive of StyleGAN2 artifacts."" (StyleGAN2 refers to the generative adversarial network (GAN) software created by Nvidia.)""These [photographs] are usually generated by one of these two sites,"" Patrini said, linking us to thispersondoesnotexist.com and generated.photos. ""The second one [site] is more likely, given that it lets a user remove and replace the background.""He said Sensity recently estimated that ""about 0.2 percent to 0.7 percent of user profiles on popular social networks use computer-generated photos."" He also told us that fake faces are mainly used for scam and fraud attempts not related to politics.""The research and technology in this space is advancing very rapidly,"" Patrini said. ""2022 is the year of breakthrough in text-to-image generation. Models such as Stable Diffusion and Dall-E will give superpowers to bad actors and fraudsters.""At some point the fake profile picture was swapped out for an American flag teardrop image. Then on Oct. 14, 2022, the admin reposted the fake, AI-generated profile photograph of the woman.:Commenters posted compliments such as ""looking good,"" ""gorgeous,"" and ""very beautiful,"" apparently not knowing that they were looking at a picture of someone who was not real. The ""Ann Ambry"" account didn't correct them.:The Group's Content: Posts That Stoke Division, Mock LGBTQ PeoplePosts by the three admins often focused on day-to-day news. They drove hatred of the state of California and Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom; downplayed the effectiveness of face masks in preventing COVID and the virus' dangers; stoked racial divisions; made fun of people who identify as LGBTQ; and supported Republican politicians running in the 2022 election.:This post was made by one of the group admins and referenced John Fetterman, a Pennsylvania Democrat who is running for U.S. Senate.The groups promoted messages in favor of former U.S. President Donald Trump, referencing recent events.:This post was shared by an admin, ""Margaret Pawlak,"" after it had been posted by another admin, ""Kristen Lee."" It played on politics on the subject of the controversy regarding DeSantis having ordered two planes of migrants to be flown from Texas to Martha's Vineyard.On Nov. 8, 2020, one day after U.S. President-elect Joe Biden was projected by The Associated Press to have won the 2020 election against Trump, the ""Ann Ambry"" account posted an announcement: ""I started a group yesterday. It's called Biden IS NOT MY PRESIDENT."" That title appeared to be a reference to the false conspiracy theory that Biden had not won, and there was reason to believe the long-ago-debunked rumors of massive voter fraud in American elections.:This post from ""Ann Ambry"" still existed in October 2022, but the group was no longer available.The group referenced in this post was not accessible, as of October 2022. We asked Meta about the group but did not receive an answer.'Engagement Drives Facebook's Business Model,' Says Ex-Facebook OfficialOn Oct. 4, after we reached out to Meta about the network, the ""Ann Ambry"" admin account posted a screenshot that said Facebook notified the account about the largest DeSantis group being ""at risk due to continued community standards violations."" In response, the admin asked members to migrate to a new group. No further details about that new group were available.Despite making billions of dollars in quarterly revenue and having tens of thousands of employees, Facebook has for years apparently struggled to promptly remove content and accounts that violate its community standards guidelines.""The issue here is misaligned incentives,"" Roger McNamee, a former adviser to Mark Zuckerberg, told us, speaking generally on the subject. McNamee is also the author of The New York Times best-selling book, ""Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe."":""The most valuable content on Facebook is harmful, so the company does everything possible to avoid removing it,"" he said. ""Why? Engagement drives Facebook's business model. The most universal way to generate engagement is to trigger fight or flight. The content that does this best is hate speech, disinformation, and conspiracy theories.""Authentic or Inauthentic?Considering Meta's statement that said it hadn't found ""evidence of policy violations,"" our own inconclusive findings, and the fact that our attempts to reach any human involved with the network were unsuccessful, we're back to where this investigation started: asking how to definitively find out if activity on Facebook is authentic or inauthentic. The possibility always remains that even the Facebook groups that seem most inauthentic might simply be managed by Americans who would rather not reveal their true identities to the platform. Our evidence shows signs of inauthentic behavior -- but, again, we don't know for sure.:"

Have a term you want us to explain? Let us know.Historically, ""false flag"" has referred to various methods of disguising one's identity or affiliation as a tactic of espionage or war (imagine a ship flying an enemy flag). But in more recent times, the phrase typically describes a brand of conspiracy theories that would have you believe that high-profile tragedies -- 9/11 or the mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school, for example -- were actually elaborate hoaxes staged by the U.S. government or some other sinister puppet master to achieve political aims (they weren't). Unfortunately, like mass shootings, false-flag theories have not gone away. As Snopes writer Dan Evon noted in a recent fact check, claims circulated that mass shootings had ""resumed"" in March 2021 under U.S. President Joe Biden after they had all but disappeared under his predecessor President Donald Trump (not true). And some users took this claim further, positing that the Boulder or Atlanta mass shootings were ""false flag"" attacks staged by liberals in order to push gun-control legislation.:The persistence of false-flag theories can be almost as mind-boggling as the chilling violence that precedes them.

533,533,522.DidtheCDCAllegeAnyon,"Claim:The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) alleges that anyone who walks into a hospital is counted as a COVID-19 case because the government pays hospitals extra money for every case. Rating:Mostly FalseAbout this rating What's TrueThe government has provided relief funds to hospitals dealing with COVID-19 cases. Medicare is paying hospital fees for some COVID-19 cases, but the program does not have a one-size-fits-all policy for covering COVID-19 cases. What's FalseNo evidence exists that the CDC claimed hospitals are inflating the coronavirus case numbers in order to get government money. :Snopes is still fighting an ""infodemic"" of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. As hospitals continued to be overwhelmed in 2020 by a surge in COVID-19 cases across the United States, false information surrounding the management of the disease and patients continued to circulate.One post in particular, shared on our Facebook group, Snopes Tips, claimed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a statement alleging that ""anyone who walks into the hospital is counted as a Covid case, no matter why they come to the hospital,"" as the government pays the hospital extra money.:There are two parts to this claim: Firstly, that hospitals are inflating their COVID-19 numbers, and secondly, that the government is allocating more funds based on coronavirus cases.Snopes covered the second part of the claim back in April. We learned that it was possible that Medicare was paying hospital fees for some COVID-19 cases, but Medicare stated that it does not make standard, one-size-fits-all payments to hospitals for patients admitted with COVID-19 diagnoses and placed on ventilators.The CDC highlighted in a statement how the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES), the Paycheck Protection Program, and Health Care Enhancement Act provided $175 billion in relief funds to hospitals and healthcare providers on the front lines of the coronavirus response:In the first round of the High Impact Allocation, $12 billion was distributed to nearly 400 hospitals who provided inpatient care for 100 or more COVID-19 patients through April 10, 2020. $2 billion of these payments was distributed to these hospitals based on their Medicare disproportionate share and uncompensated care payments. In the second round of funding, $10 billion will be distributed to hospitals having over 161 COVID-19 admissions between January 1 and June 10, 2020.:For the first part of the claim, we looked through CDC statements and reports about people admitted to hospitals around the country and were unable to find a case where the CDC said that the hospital was inflating its COVID-19 case numbers in order to get more money. We reached out to the CDC, and the agency referred us to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), but did not confirm whether it had ever made such a statement about hospitals counting everyone who enters as a COVID-19 case.U.S. President Donald Trump promoted another version of this conspiracy theory at a rally in October, where he said hospitals were inflating the numbers of COVID-19 deaths, and was roundly debunked by news outlets and rejected in a statement by the American College of Emergency Physicians. To imply that emergency physicians would inflate the number of deaths from this pandemic to gain financially is offensive, especially as many are actually under unprecedented financial strain as they continue to bear the brunt of COVID-19. These baseless claims not only do a disservice to our health care heroes but promulgate the dangerous wave of misinformation which continues to hinder our nation's efforts to get the pandemic under control and allow our nation to return to normalcy.:The dire situation in hospitals paints a very different picture, far-removed from claims that they are profiting financially from the pandemic. A New York Times report from Nov. 27, 2020, highlighted how surging coronavirus numbers were resulting in a crisis-level shortage of beds and staff around the country. In some cases, hospitals were facing shortages in protective equipment, forcing healthcare workers to buy their own. As of Dec. 3, 2020, hospitalizations from the virus topped 100,000 -- an all-time high since the pandemic began. An April Washington Post report described how hospitals were also suffering from financial losses on account of their deferring or cancelling non-urgent surgeries to free up bed space for the pandemic, cutting off income, and forcing them to lay off workers. At the time, relief packages for hospitals were widely described as insufficient.Hospital-reported data on COVID-19 patients have addressed a range of issues around the country. A July 2020 ProPublica report detailed how the Trump administration had told hospitals to stop reporting data to the CDC and instead report it to HHS. The move resulted in widespread confusion. While the number of infected patients was soaring nationally, for a period of time it was unclear how many were being treated in hospitals for COVID-19. A few states like Idaho and South Carolina experienced temporary information blackouts, and the COVID Tracking Project reported issues with its figures.:A Nov. 29, 2020, investigation by the American Association for the Advancement of Science's (AAAS) magazine found the federal system for tracking COVID-19 patients was continuing to carry questionable data. HHS collected hospital patient data in two ways -- through HHS Protect, and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR). Their two sources of data on the usage of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds for COVID patients conflicted sharply in at least six states. HHS data also diverged sharply from state-supplied data, and showed that over the last two months, COVID-19 in-patient tally in 14 states was consistently lower than HHS Protect's.In at least 27 states, the tally was alternating between being lower and higher than HHS. And recently, in 16 states, the tallies grew closer. The over-arching conclusion for this analysis was that hospitals are going to be over-stressed in the upcoming months, with inaccurate information systems in place.We have reached out to the HHS to learn more, and will update this post with more information.:Additionally, if the language of the claim is taken at face value, CDC guidance for hospitals references providing ""necessary in-person clinical services for conditions other than COVID-19 in the safest way possible, minimizing disease transmission to patients [...]."" This leads to the conclusion that the CDC itself is not stating that hospitals are classifying everyone who walks in as a COVID-19 case.While it is true that the government did provide relief funds in various forms for COVID-19 cases to hospitals in need of aid, little evidence exists that numbers were being inflated by hospitals for this reason. We thus rate this claim as ""Mostly False."""
534,534,90.KatyPerryIsJonBenétR,"Claim:Pop singer Katy Perry is actually JonBenet Ramsey, whose death was faked.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In February 2016, an old internet conspiracy theory was revived when several media outlets picked up a YouTube video which asserted that JonBenet Ramsey (a six-year-old beauty pageant star who was killed in 1996, and whose murder remains unsolved) never actually died, and instead grew up to be singer Katy Perry:: The conspiracy theory is based on a variety of observations, but none of the claims are especially convincing. For example, one piece of ""evidence"" is that Katy Perry and JonBenet Ramsey have similar eyebrows. Another piece of incidental information cited as evidence is that the pop singer once mentioned Ramsey during an interview. The full quote, which can be found in Perry's biography, reads::(Katy Perry) would appear on stage at church, at family functions and even for birthday meals in restaurants when she would serenade the table with the latest gospel tune. ""Wherever I went, restaurants or whatever, I would get up and sing 'Amazing Grace,'"" Katy later revealed to the Mail. ""Not that I was one of those stage kids. There was no JonBenet Ramsey inside of me waiting to burst out. I just started.... writing little songs about God or this boy I liked, the two men in my life at the same time.""It's unclear how the above-displayed quote, in which Katy Perry says that she is not JonBenet Ramsey, proves that she is JonBenet Ramsey.The creator of the conspiracy video, David Johnson, has produced dozens of similar pieces, each offering up ""proof"" that one person is really another. In addition to Katy Perry as JonBenet, Johnson also claims that Donald Trump is Joe Biden, Jimmy Hendrix is Lionel Ritchie, and Prince Charles is Sir Richard Branson:: Despite the video, Johnson isn't the first to subscribe to this particular theory. The idea was first floated on various internet forums after the pop singer shared a ""glamour shot"" of herself as a child in August 2010:: While most comments more or less jokingly pointed out the young Perry's (very slight) resemblance to JonBenet, this photo provided the seed for a new conspiracy theory.This isn't even the first time that a pop singer has been accused of being an adult JonBenet. Before Katy Perry, it was Lady Gaga, but unlike Katy Perry's conspiracy theory, which centered on the singer's eyebrows, the ""evidence"" for Lady Gaga focused on her ears:: There are many logical flaws with these theories. First, Perry was born in 1984, six years before JonBenet (and Lady Gaga, nee Stefani Germanotta, was born in 1986). Second, Perry's childhood is well-documented, as is Lady Gaga's: :Finally, while the tragic case of JonBenet Ramsey's murder remains unsolved, that doesn't mean that she is still alive. Police discovered Ramsey's body in her family's basement on 26 December 1996, and an autopsy was performed not long afterward."
535,535,428.DidMarjorieTaylorGre,"Claim:U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene once followed and shouted at Parkland mass shooting survivor and gun control activist David Hogg.Rating:TrueAbout this rating In January 2021, after the 118th Congress was sworn in, attention turned to the record and background of U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, who promoted the far-right QAnon cluster of conspiracy theories and gained the support of former President Donald Trump during her campaign. :On Jan. 19, left-leaning Media Matters for America revealed that in 2018, Greene had explicitly endorsed the false and damaging conspiracy theory that the Parkland mass shooting, which left 17 people dead at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida in February 2018, had been faked in order to justify a crackdown on gun rights.A week later, CNN reported that Greene had ""liked"" Facebook posts that called for the assassination of high-profile Democratic politicians. In response, Greene said those particular actions had been taken by other unnamed individuals who have managed her Facebook page. On Jan. 27, social media users began sharing a video which they described as showing Greene harassing or confronting David Hogg, a former Stoneman Douglas High School student and survivor of the mass shooting there, who has gone on to become a gun control activist. Since 2018, Hogg has been a frequent target of disinformation and baseless conspiracy theories for his role as a public advocate on behalf of those killed in the Parkland massacre.:Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter Jaime was murdered in the shooting, posted the video clip along with the following caption:[Marjorie Taylor Greene], is this you harassing [David Hogg] weeks after the Parkland shooting, that my daughter was killed in & he was in? Calling him a coward for ignoring your insanity. I will answer all of your questions in person. Get ready to record again.:A similar, widely-shared tweet was posted by the journalist Yashar Ali, who wrote that the video showed Greene ""trolling"" Hogg. Those descriptions were accurate. The woman at the center of the video was indeed Greene, and the man who was the subject of her ire was indeed Hogg. Greene posted the video to her own YouTube account in January 2020, and it remained published there at time of writing. However, the video was recorded during Greene's visit to Washington, D.C., in March 2019. The confrontation in question did not take place mere ""weeks"" after the Parkland massacre, as Guttenberg claimed, but rather just over a year later.In fact, Snopes has uncovered evidence that Greene followed and harangued Hogg on two separate occasions during that visit. Her purpose was ostensibly to lobby members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives to oppose ""Red Flag"" gun laws, which authorize law enforcement agencies to exercise emergency gun confiscation powers in cases where an individual is flagged by loved ones as being at immediate risk of doing serious harm to themselves or others.:Two ConfrontationsThe first confrontation took place on March 25, 2019, and was streamed live on Greene's Facebook page. The video has since been removed, but a cached version shows that Greene described it as having taken place inside U.S. Senate offices, called it ""a surprise David Hogg confrontation,"" and said ""This was the first one when we came across their group inside.""Later that day, Greene conducted an interview with Will Johnson, a far-right social media personality who once had his own show on the conspiracy theorist platform Infowars, and now runs a platform called ""Unite America First."" That interview contained a clip from Greene's confrontation with Hogg (apparently the one streamed live on Greene's Facebook account earlier that day).In prefacing the footage, Greene complained that Hogg and his fellow activists appeared to have garnered more media coverage than her, and expressed frustration that he appeared to have been able to secure a greater number of meetings with senators and representatives while she, in many cases, found lawmakers unwilling to meet with her, or did not receive any response to her requests. At one point, Johnson calls Hogg ""pretty despicable,"" to which Greene responds ""Yes."":At the time of the confrontation, Hogg was 18 years old. His youth clearly appears to have been a consideration for Greene, who told Johnson she had checked his Wikipedia page and found he was 18 years old which meant, in her view, ""I'm not picking on a kid.""In the footage itself, which can be viewed below, Greene can be seen following Hogg and his associates through hallways amid U.S. Senate offices. Hogg never demonstrates any willingness to speak with Greene, and the confrontation appears entirely uninvited and unsolicited on his part.Nonetheless, Greene continues to follow Hogg, shouting a series of questions and statements at him about gun control policy, red flag laws and, provocatively, the Parkland shooting itself, of which Hogg is himself a survivor. At one point, Greene shouts at Hogg, ""If the FBI had followed through on their tips, then Nikolas Cruz wouldn't have been able to kill 17 people in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School."" Later in the video, Greene assails Hogg for his youth and supposed naivety, in an apparent contradiction of her earlier explanation that, since Hogg was 18 years old, he should be treated as an adult: ""David Hogg, you don't even know what you have. You're so young you cannot realize that the right to bear arms is what makes America so great."":The second confrontation is the one shown in the videos posted by Guttenberg, Ali and others in January 2021. Based on descriptions contained in a Big League Politics report, it appears to have taken place later on the same day, Mar. 25, 2019.  The video, as posted to Greene's YouTube channel, can be viewed below. It again shows Greene following Hogg, this time outside on a sidewalk, shouting questions and statements at him. Again, she makes provocative pronouncements about the mass shooting which Hogg himself survived, and accuses him of ""using kids as a barrier."" :At no point does Hogg engage with Greene, or respond to her, much to the visible frustration of the future Congresswoman. After she ends her pursuit of Hogg, Greene turns to the camera and says ""He's a coward, he can't say one word to defend his stance, because there is no defense for taking away guns.""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM05FwyhHPA&tIn the days after her brief visit to Washington, D.C., Greene repeatedly advertised and promoted her confrontations with Hogg on Facebook and Twitter.Reacting to the renewed coverage of the footage in January 2021, Lauren Hogg -- a sister of David's and herself a survivor of the Parkland shooting and a gun control activist -- wrote on Twitter that:""The harassment that [David Hogg] and I received in the aftermath of the shooting was so severe that I have more PTSD from the harassment and conspiracy theorists that we've had to deal with with than I do going through the actual shooting."":"
536,536,477.NunesMemoDropsandFlo,"On 2 February 2018, United States lawmakers made good on a promise to release a controversial memo compiled by Rep. Devin Nunes, the California Republican who chairs the House Intelligence Committee. For weeks, Republican lawmakers, right wing web sites and conspiracy cranks had hyped that the document would prove that an ongoing Federal Bureau of Investigation-led probe into allegations of collusion against associates of U.S. President Donald Trump was driven by political bias.The campaign to release the then-classified memo touted that the document would show the Russia investigation, now led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, is tainted because it wholly relied on a dossier penned by a former British spy, paid for by Democratic opposition research in the lead-up to the 2016 election. This was not the case.The memo itself undermines that claim by pointing out that the FBI had not relied solely on a controversial dossier written by former MI6 agent Christopher Steele to secure a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant against Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. It also points out that the investigation was initially launched before the FBI had the dossier in their possession, as a result of information gathered from another Trump campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, in July 2016::The Papadopoulos information triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016 by FBI agent Pete Strzok. Strzok was reassigned by the Special Counsel's Office to FBI Human Resources for improper text messages with his mistress, FBI Attorney Lisa Page (no known relation to Carter Page), where they both demonstrated a clear bias against Trump and in favor of Clinton, whom Strzok had also investigated. The Strzok/Lisa Page texts also reflect extensive discussions about the investigation, orchestrating leaks to the media, and include a meeting with Deputy Director McCabe to discuss an ""insurance"" policy against President Trump's election.Strzok's text messaging with Lisa Page has been the subject of relentless conspiracy theories meant to paint the FBI as harboring a political bias against Trump, so much so that in January 2018 an inside joke between the two led to days of speculation about a nonexistent anti-Trump ""secret society"" amid FBI ranks. As Bloomberg pointed out:Some anti-Trump texts exchanged between Strzok and Lisa Page have been publicly released, and their roles are part of the inspector general's investigation. But the agents also criticized Clinton in their texts, and it's unclear whether their work was swayed by their personal views. Mueller removed Strzok from the Russia inquiry after the texts were discovered, and Page had already left his team. Ironically, by referring to the inquiry into Papadopoulos the Republican memo confirms that the Russia investigation was already under way before Steele's dossier made its way to the FBI.[...]The FBI is traditionally a Republican-friendly institution, and former director James Comey's handling of the Clinton probe is widely believed to have helped Trump win the White House. When it comes to Mueller, Republican leaders on both sides of Capitol Hill have said repeatedly they have confidence in the special counsel and want the investigation to continue.:The memo also notes that the warrant against Page was renewed three times -- as CNN's Jim Sciutto pointed out, that means the FBI would have had to go before a FISA court judge in each instance and demonstrate the warrant continued to be merited:NB: Warrant on Carter Page was renewed THREE times after initial issuance, for which the @FBI would have had to show to judge it was getting valuable intelligence Page was acting as agent of foreign Govt.-- Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) February 2, 2018Aside from document contents that undermined its apparent intent, journalists combed through the memo and immediately found errors and omissions. One obvious slip-up found by Mother Jones's Washington D.C. bureau chief David Corn was that the date on one of their stories cited in the memo was wrong:Hey, Nunes and Co., it was October 31. Sloppy? pic.twitter.com/tWjeKftMF0-- David Corn (@DavidCornDC) February 2, 2018:Reuters reporter Jonathan Landay also pointed out the memo fails to mention that Page took a trip to Moscow in early July 2016 that got the attention of the FBI. Among the activities of Page's visit was a speech criticizing U.S. foreign policy toward Russia -- a speech that was friendly toward Russian President Vladimir Putin's views on the subject.Further casting doubt on the reliability of the document, both The Daily Beast and the Wall Street Journal reported that although the memo claims that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe testified before the House Intelligence Committee in December 2017 that the dossier was crucial to the FISA warrant application, officials told reporters for both publications this information was false and that McCabe (who stepped down from his FBI post days before the memo was made public) had testified he didn't know how reliant the warrant application was on the dossier.The release of the memo had been preceded by an intense conspiracy theory-laden social media campaign that utilized the hashtag #ReleaseTheMemo. Perhaps ironically, the campaign had been heavily promoted by Russian social media bots, per Hamilton68, a live dashboard that tracks Russian bot activity::Andrew Weisburd, non-resident fellow at the Alliance for Securing Democracy (a bipartisan, transatlantic initiative housed at The German Marshall Fund of the United States) and one of the researchers behind the Hamilton68 tool told us:The Kremlin-oriented trolls and bots are following the lead of Nunes and the Trumpniks, but clearly the Kremlin has as much interest in ending Mueller's investigation as the GOP and the White House. Kremlin also has an undeniable interest in undermining the FBI as the lead counterintelligence force of the United States. On the other side, Nunes, the White House, and the House GOP seem incapable of feeling anything like shame for being on the same side as Putin and Company.:Nunes, either spurred or undeterred by the reception of the memo, is hinting that more will come."
537,537,355.DoestheRoswellRockHa,"An episode of the History Channel's UFO conspiracy theory show ""Ancient Aliens"" raises a question: A crop circle in England has the same pattern as one etched on a rock found next to the legendary ""UFO crash site"" in Roswell, New Mexico. Is this a sign that extraterrestrials are trying to communicate with us?The short answer is no. But we'll walk through the reasoning for that conclusion here.Crop CirclesCrop circles, or circular geometric patterns that have been appearing in agricultural fields since the 1970s, are human-created hoaxes. Nevertheless, they continue to capture the imaginations of UFO enthusiasts who believe them to be signs that intelligent alien life not only visited Earth, but delivered cryptic (albeit annoying, no doubt, to crop owners) messages.As Smithsonian Magazine reported in 2009, two English artists, Doug Bower and Dave Chorley, copped to being the ones behind a spate of crop circles that appeared in southern England from the 1970s through the 1990s. :The men, landscape painters by trade, made designs in fields that created something of a cultural phenomenon, Smithsonian reported, attracting ""a gaggle of self-appointed experts. An efflorescence of mystical and magical thinking, scientific and pseudo-scientific research, conspiracy theories and general pandemonium broke out."" Smithsonian further reported:Almost as soon as crop circles became public knowledge, they attracted a gaggle of self-appointed experts. An efflorescence of mystical and magical thinking, scientific and pseudo-scientific research, conspiracy theories and general pandemonium broke out. The patterns stamped in fields were treated as a lens through which the initiated could witness the activity of earth energies and ancient spirits, the anguish of Mother Earth in the face of impending ecological doom, and evidence of secret weapons testing and, of course, aliens. Today, one of the more vigorously promoted ideas is that they are messages, buried in complex numerological codes, concerning a Great Change connected to the pre-Columbian Mayan calendar and due to occur in 2012.But this rash of mystical and conspiratorial thinking linked to crop circles didn't appear in a vacuum. It appeared against the backdrop of the fact that strange crop patterns had been reported for centuries, and sometimes these reports were linked to alleged UFO landings.:When hoaxers provide fake evidence that feeds into an existing legend, the term used for that by folklorists is ""ostension,"" per Smithsonian. So when Bower and Chorley created their crop circles in the later half of the 20th Century, that was an act of ostension.A similar thing can possibly be said about the Roswell Rock.The Roswell RockThe ""Ancient Aliens"" episode mentioned at the beginning of this story notes that in 2004, a New Mexico man named Robert Ridge found a rock 11 miles from the famed Roswell site, widely believed among UFO enthusiasts to have been an alien ship crash site in 1947. The rock was unique because had a design bearing the same pattern as a crop circle in England, and because it allegedly had magnetic properties.An image of the two can be seen in the tweet here::But finding a rock near Roswell with an etching that matches the pattern used in a crop circle hoax isn't evidence of an extraterrestrial message to Earth. In 2008, a glass artists replicated the rock using a technique called precision stone carving."
538,538,14.BillboardsPromoting4,"In May 2018, a Reddit user posted the image of a billboard in southern Oklahoma to the subreddit ""greatawakening,"" which is dedicated to a largely incoherent, ever-widening conspiracy theory known as ""The Storm""  (with the hashtag #QAnon) that involves an anonymous group of ""highly placed"" government individuals nobly fighting the corruption of the ""Deep State"" (that is to say, the civil servants who work within the American government) while representing themselves as someone going only by ""Q""::The billboard sports an oversized, American flag-bedazzled letter ""Q,"" next to which is the text ""Where We Go One We Go All"" -- a popular Q slogan which apparently is a line in the 1996 Jeff Bridges movie White Squall, whose plot involves people surviving a storm (the name of the conspiracy!) on a sailboat (a metaphor!) The billboard primarily promotes the website ""DoUKnowQ.com,"" which -- though it has the appearance of being informative -- seems primarily concerned with pure profit.An archived version of the website from May 2018 shows that it was once in the business of selling Q-related website domains at a significant markup. Now, their ""online store"" links to a Cafepress web shop selling Q branded merchandise like T-shirts and mugs. We called the company that owns that billboard space -- Lindmark Outdoor Media -- to confirm that the billboard was real and to inquire about its origins. A representative who answered a call to their corporate office told us that the billboard -- which is found between exits 21 and 24 on southbound I-35 north of the Texas border -- was real, that it had been rented since 1 May 2018, and that it appeared to be booked through to the end of the year.:We asked what group paid for the ad, and were first told that it was not a group but an individual. Though we were told they could not disclose any information about this person, the first representative we spoke to at Lindmark used the word ""she"" to refer to the owner multiple times. A follow-up call from our managing editor yielded a statement from a different representative of the company. That individual told us:As far as the billboard itself, we don't know anything about the people behind the billboard and what it means, as far as that goes, we can't give away people's names. We don't like to get involved with anything political. I had never heard of them until we looked them up on the internet, to make sure it wasn't political -- we don't like any of that sort of thing.On 29 June 2018, a tweet from Daily Beast tech and internet reporter Will Sommer suggested that the phenomena of Q-inspired billboards was not limited to Oklahoma:QAnon billboards are a thing now. This one's in Georgia. pic.twitter.com/VQ0Hn3T7h6-- Will Sommer (@willsommer) June 29, 2018:There have been multiple pictures of this same billboard, which suggest that the billboard is real and that it is just south of the Tennessee border in northern Georgia on northbound I-75. Dixieland Fireworks, occupying the billboard space directly above the QANON billboard, is located right off the first I-75 exit after passing north into Tennessee.The Georgia billboard, unlike the Oklahoma one, does not appear to be motivated by any sort of profit -- it merely contains the hashtag ""#QANON"" and the text ""Truth is Freedom."" It is unclear what advertising firm owns that billboard space, however. The most prominent firm in this region is Lamar Advertising. We spoke with the sales manager of their Rome, Georgia office to ask if the billboard was theirs. She was not familiar with the , and after a search of their records and a discussion with their graphic designer, she told us they are confident it does not belong to them.The only other possible firm it could belong to, based on our discussion with Lamar, would be a company called Fairway Outdoor Advertising. We spoke with a representative of that company who was unaware of the , and who forwarded us to their sales manager. We reached out to him via e-mail and voicemail, but have not received a response.:The basis (if you want to call it that) for ""The Storm"" conspiracy theory are ""breadcrumbs"" of vague information or aphorisms left by ""Q"" on the misogynistic, racist, and troll-filled online messageboard that is 4chan. The beauty of the conspiracy is that these nuggets of information are so meaningless that people can interpret them literally any way they want, and then retroactively attribute current events as having been predicted by this anonymous entity. Another beauty, apparently, is that anyone can buy a billboard and claim to be involved."
539,539,551.DidaRogueTeamofUSVet,"Claim:In late August 2021, a rogue team of U.S. veterans banded together to go behind President Joe Biden's back and rescue Afghan allies in an operation dubbed ""Pineapple Express.""Rating:MixtureAbout this rating What's TrueAn all-volunteer team of American veterans of the Afghan war banded together to help evacuate hundreds of Afghan elite-forces members and their families to safety in late August 2021 as the Taliban took over. The operation was called ""Pineapple Express."" However... What's FalseThis operation did not occur ""behind Biden's back,"" and the description of the team as ""rogue"" is inaccurate. The volunteers worked in an unofficial capacity in tandem with the U.S. military and embassy, to help move groups of evacuees to safety. :In mid-August 2021, the Taliban took over most major cities in Afghanistan, including Kabul, resulting in a mass evacuation effort of Afghan citizens, including those who had worked in some capacity with the U.S. government and military. As uniformed members of the U.S. military held back at Kabul airport with strict instructions to not move beyond the perimeter to help people, an informal group of volunteers led by American veterans of the war coordinated an operation to evacuate their allies, consisting of Afghan elite-forces members and their families. The operation was dubbed ""Pineapple Express"" because pictures of pineapples were used by team members as rescue codes on cell phones. Right-wing conspiracy theory site Gateway Pundit claimed that the entire process took place ""behind the Biden State Department's back."" The article stated, ""Furious over the terrible situation in they had already sacrificed so much to prevent when they served, the team of retired specialists, including Green Berets and Navy SEALS, risked their lives. They volunteered to travel to Kabul because they were afraid that Joe Biden was abandoning at-risk Afghan elite forces, leaving them to die at the hands of terrorists."" :But members of the operation spoke to ABC News, and although they expressed frustration at the administration's handling of the evacuation, they worked informally in coordination with the U.S. Embassy and military. The week-long effort was also observed by ABC News. Task Force Pineapple was an ad hoc group of retired special operators, aid workers, intelligence officials, and more with experience in Afghanistan. A staffer for Florida Republican Rep. Mike Waltz -- also a retired Green Beret -- coordinated with a U.S. Embassy officer, and uniformed military in the airport perimeters provided overwatch and awaited the movements of the volunteers on the ground. Col. Scott Mann, a retired Green Beret commander, who led the effort, spoke to ABC News about the process during which more than 500 Afghan allies including assets, special operators, and their families, were smuggled into Kabul airport where they were evacuated. ""We are collating, learning and adapting -- and moving faster than the hamstrung U.S. bureaucracy,"" he said.:The process was harrowing, according to ABC News, beginning with an effort around mid-August, after the Taliban takeover, to get one Afghan commando out who was being hunted by the Taliban. ABC News reported on his arrival at the airport and how he was aided by the U.S. military:With Taliban fighters mixing into the crowd of thousands and firing their AK-47s above the masses, the former elite commando was finally pulled into the U.S. security perimeter, where he shouted the password ""pineapple"" to American troops at the checkpoint. (The password has since changed.)Two days later, the group of his American friends and comrades also helped get his family inside the airport to join him with the aid of the same U.S. embassy officer.The operation continued with more evacuees:With the uniformed U.S. military unable to venture outside the airport's perimeter to collect Americans and Afghans who've sought U.S. protection for their past joint service, they instead provided overwatch and awaited coordinated movements by an informal Pineapple Express ground team that included ""conductors"" led by former Green Beret Capt. Zac Lois, known as the underground railroad's ""engineer."":The Afghan operators, assets, interpreters and their families were known as ""passengers"" and they were being guided remotely by ""shepherds,"" who are, in most cases their loyal former U.S. special operations forces and CIA comrades and commanders, according to chat room communications viewed by ABC News.There was one engineer, a few conductors, as well as people who were performing intelligence-gathering duties. The intelligence was pooled in the encrypted chat group in real-time and included guiding people on maps to GPS pin drops at rally points for them to stage in the shadows and in hiding until summoned by a conductor wearing a green chem light, ABC News observed in the encrypted chat.Once summoned, passengers would hold up their smartphones with a graphic of yellow pineapples on a pink field.[...]Many of the Afghans arrived near Abbey Gate and waded through a sewage-choked canal toward a U.S. soldier wearing red sunglasses to identify himself. They waved their phones with the pineapples and were scooped up and brought inside the wire to safety. Others were brought in by an Army Ranger wearing a modified American flag patch with the Ranger Regiment emblem, sources told ABC News.:""This Herculean effort couldn't have been done without the unofficial heroes inside the airfield who defied their orders to not help beyond the airport perimeter, by wading into sewage canals and pulling in these targeted people who were flashing pineapples on their phones,"" Mann added. Lois told Fox News: ""We have developed kind of an underground railroad, we have shepherds that guide flocks... its special operations personnel coaching, teaching, guiding and advising in most cases our brothers that we served with. The U.S. government is sending us people as well that need help getting out, so we are in coordination and we are working with the U.S. government.""We should note that none of the members of the task force travelled to Afghanistan themselves to complete the rescue mission, everything was coordinated through an encrypted messaging platform, according to their spokesperson who reached out to us. Another operation called ""Task Force Dunkirk"" also worked on getting Afghans out. Retired Marine Lt. Col. Russell Worth Parker, who was a spokesperson for the group, told ABC News their mission statement: ""To just get one more Afghan out. And after we get him or her out, we want to get just one more. That's the best that we can do right now, and we don't want to get at cross purposes with any broader effort."":Lois told Fox News the Pineapple Express aims to continue, even as the U.S. military departed on Aug. 31: ""We are playing the long game. We plan on being here for a while so that is why any support people can really give to Task Force Pineapple it would be really beneficial moving ahead."" Given that members of the task force coordinated with the government, which included military and embassy officers, this could not have taken place without the knowledge of the Biden administration. We thus rate this claim as ""Mixture."" "
540,540,11.QuriousAboutQAnonGet,"In the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, elements of an unwieldy and unfounded conspiracy theory, QAnon (Q), were percolating on the fringes of the internet. While Q wasn't fully Q yet, the groundwork was being laid through rumors that falsely claimed a cabal of Democratic leaders and liberal entertainers engaged in satanic rituals and global sex trafficking. By this writing in August 2020, Q was going mainstream: A GOP candidate with a record of promoting QAnon had won a primary race in Georgia; QAnon was being regularly promoted on Fox News; and Q content was even appearing in the social media threads of U.S. President Donald Trump. When he was asked about the dangerous conspiracy theory on Aug. 19 at a news conference, he refused to condemn the group, which the FBI has identified as a domestic terrorist threat, and instead called QAnon a group of people who love their country. As the group QAnon has grown, its tentacles have reached into all manners of political discourse, spreading lies about everything from vaccination, to Black Lives Matter, to the fight against COVID-19. It is a vehicle for disinformation, and it is quickly riding its way to the ballot in 2020. If voters aren't aware of Q and its origins, they should be. :So What Exactly Is QAnon?QAnon refers to a group of people who have built a belief system by extrapolating meaning from cryptic messages that were posted by an anonymous person(s) on various internet forums.How Does QAnon Work?In general, an anonymous poster who goes by ""Q"" and purports to be a high-ranking government official drops cryptic messages and leading questions (known as Q drops or crumbs) onto 8kun, an internet forum, that are then dissected by internet researchers in the hopes of finding a coded message. In this manner, QAnon has built a rich and nonsensical body of lore that pits Trump and his supporters against a cabal of Satan-worshiping liberal elites. Pure QAnonsense.Is QAnon Dangerous?:Yes.The FBI identified QAnon as a threat in a May 2019 memo outlining how ""fringe political conspiracy theories very likely motivate some domestic extremists to commit criminal, sometimes violent activity.""The memo listed a handful of examples of how QAnon has led to criminal activity. One example: a June 2018 incident involving a man armed with assault rifles and handguns, who blocked a bridge near the Hoover Dam in an armored vehicle while making demands related to the QAnon movement. Another incident involved an armed group that harassed citizens and businesses in Tucson, Arizona, as they ""investigated"" claims of an alleged, nearby sex trafficking ring. In August 2020, a woman was arrested on aggravated assault charges after she chased down and attacked a woman she falsely believed was involved in sex trafficking. The FBI spelled out the danger of these conspiracy theories in a memo, writing::The FBI assesses in some cases anti-government, identity based, and fringe political conspiracy theories very likely encourage the targeting of specific people, places, and organizations, thereby increasing the risk of extremist violence against such targets. This assessment is based on several incidents where individuals threatened, assaulted, or plotted to attack entities they perceived as being linked to or involved with an alleged conspiracy. This targeting occurs when promoters of conspiracy theories, claiming to act as ""researches"" or ""investigators,"" single out people, businesses, or groups which they falsely accuse of being involved in the imagined scheme. These targets are then subjected to harassment campaigns and threats by supporters of the theory, and become vulnerable to violence or other dangerous acts.What Does QAnon Believe?In general, QAnon believes Trump is in the middle of a biblical war against a ""deep state,"" satanic cabal of baby-eating, child sex-traffickers led by prominent members of the Democratic party, entertainers who espouse liberal opinions, anybody who mentions ""pizza,"" and authoritative sources who relay credible information that may cast a negative light on the president. Proponents of this theory believe that one day soon the ""storm"" will come and Trump, with the help of an anonymous high-ranking military official known as ""Q,"" will round up members of the deep state, arrest them, and possibly have them executed.:Here's how Ben Collins, who reports on QAnon for NBC News, described the conspiracy theory on the Lawfare Podcast [edited slightly for clarity]:So Qanon is based on this idea that there's a high-level government insider who is leaking intelligence on 8kun, which used to be 8chan [...]. He posts these things on 8kun, which are known as Q drops, that are basically unfalsifiable puzzles, like little cues that show that in the future something big will happen involving traditional enemies of the Republican party: Hillary Clinton, John Podesta, Barack Obama, people like that.And it started off incredibly specific. It started off in October 2017, and he said that the next day, on October 30, that Hillary Clinton would be rounded up and that the National Guard would be activated, because so many people would be rioting on the streets because Hillary Clinton was about to be arrested and that her passport, I believe seized, or something like that, and she wouldn't be allowed to leave the country. None of that happened, obviously.And you would think that that would stop it. That was the very first Q post ever. But, we are here now, three years later, and it's larger than ever. In part because people try to find some answers in these incredibly vague posts and through that they have built this community that believes that sometime soon there will be mass arrests of every prominent arrest for what they believe to be crimes of eating children, literally, satanic cannibals, and they will be rounded up and marched down the street to their execution.:In order to get a better understanding of QAnon, it's helpful to strip this conspiracy theory of some of its specifics and look at this group in more general terms.At its core, QAnon believes that the news is fake, that scientists are wrong, and that anyone who voices opposition to the Trump administration is likely in, or at least being controlled by, the deep state. This allows QAnon to draw distinct lines between good (Trump) and evil (Trump's perceived enemies).How Big Is QAnon?It's difficult to quantify exactly how much QAnon has grown. An Aug. 10 report from NBC News stated that the largest QAnon groups on Facebook have more than 3 million aggregate followers.Perhaps more importantly, however, is that QAnon is starting to gain mainstream acceptance in the Republican party. In addition to Trump's aforementioned encouraging remarks about the conspiracy theory, supporters of Q have also started making headway in their campaigns for political office. Marjorie Taylor Greene, for instance, won a primary runoff in Georgia and could soon become the first member of Congress to openly support QAnon.:According to Alex Kaplan, a researcher with Media Matters, more than 70 current or former congressional candidates supported QAnon in 2020. The vast majority of these candidates were Republicans (72), one was a Libertarian, and two were Democrats. Why Is It Called QAnon?:These claims largely originated with anonymous posts on internet message boards by a person, or persons, known as ""Q"" (QAnon). ""Anon"" is also a term that generally describes an anonymous internet poster.Who is Q?The identity of Q is not publicly known. As these posts are anonymous, it's possible that Q is multiple people.A 2018 news report from NBC News credited three people for popularizing the theory: a YouTube streamer named Tracy Diaz, and two 4Chan administrators, Paul Furber, who went by the name BaruchtheScribe, and Coleman Rogers, who went by Pamphlet Anon.Who Is Q According to QAnon?Proponents of this conspiracy theory believe that ""Q"" is a high-level military officer, government official, or member of the Trump administration with ""Q-level security clearance."":""Q Clearance"" is truly a high-level security clearance in the U.S. government, but it does not pertain to the military. Q clearance comes from the U.S. Department of Energy.Mike Rothschild, a QAnon reporter for The Daily Dot, said that Q has not posted any information that would have required high-level security clearance. Regardless, followers have suggested that ""Q"" is likely a high-ranking member of the Trump administration.The Week reported:The most popular theory among the community is that Q is someone within Trump's administration, a Michael Flynn-type character or even Trump himself. During one Trump trip to Asia, Q posted some pictures of islands, ""which supporters seized on as proof that Q was on Air Force One"", says Sommer.But ""there's really nothing in the information QAnon has dropped that would necessitate top secret clearance or access to the president"", says The Daily Dot's Mike Rothschild.Another theory is that Q is in fact ""a shadowy military intelligence figure who recruited Trump for the presidency"", Rothschild adds.:When Did Q Start?The seeds of QAnon were planted during the run-up to the 2016 election as internet users claimed, among other things, that a global, pedophile sex-trafficking ring was being run out of the basement of a pizza shop. The ""pizzagate"" conspiracy theory has repeatedly been debunked (this pizza parlor didn't even have a basement). But it planted several ideas -- chief among them the notion that liberal politicians, progressive businesses, and all manner of celebrities took part in satanic rituals -- which evolved into QAnon.The first QAnon post, or Q drop, can be traced back to an Oct. 28, 2017, post on the internet forum 4chan. That post claimed that the extradition of Hillary Clinton was already underway and that the National Guard would be activated on Oct. 30 with the expectation of mass rioting following her arrest.:This, of course, never came to fruition.In the following days, this poster started self-identifying as ""Q Clearance Patriot"" and used the ""Q"" moniker at the end of these posts:While this ""Q Clearance Patriot"" supposedly had inside information that John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, would be arrested on Nov. 3, this, too, did not happen.A number of other anonymous internet posters (or Anons) had claimed to be high-ranking government officials, but Q's posts struck a chord with the community. The unfounded notions of ""pizzagate"" that had previously been dismissed due to a severe lack of evidence, now had the support, proponents of this theory believed, of an authoritative voice who was working on the inside. :Despite early demonstrations that this person's information was unreliable (or, more realistically, simply made up), Q continued to post ""Q Drops"" or ""bread crumbs.""What Are Crumbs?While Q may be a single entity (even if made up by several different posters), the QAnon conspiracy theory is a collaborative effort between Q and the Q community. After leaving each crumb, drop, or clue, on a message board Q followers -- or bakers -- work to decipher the meaning.Here's an example of a typical Q drop. As you'll notice, this post from November 2017 provides little in terms of actual information. Rather, it is full of cryptic statements and leading questions:Patriots don't sleep.40,000ft. v. necessary to understand [US]/SA/global events.Paint the picture.Decrease altitude (we will not fly that high again).Higher the altitude greater the [risk] of conspiracy ST.Many cannot/will not swallow.What is No Such Agency - Q group?Who has clearance to full picture?Important.SIS is good.+++Adm R+++What agency is at war w/ Clowns In America?How does POTUS shift narrative?(New) Age of Enlightenment.80% covert.20% public.What has occurred over [th]e last several months?C-info leaks?Operations (think SA + ???)?CNN sale?What co's rec large cash injections by Clowns In America (public)?Why???Who does [i]t hurt?Who control[s] the MSM?Primary objective from beginning: POTUS discredit MSM.[W]hy is this relevant?How is information transmitted?How are people inform[e]d?Why was Sarah A.

What, after all, does ""Godfather III"" have to do with the deep state cabal?""QAnon Anonymous,"" a podcast featuring investigations into Q by Travis View, a reporter from the Washington Post, likened this manner of ""baking"" to an improvisational game in which Q provides ""crumbs"" that ""bakers"" then use to turn into ""bread."" If we ignore the flawed metaphor (bread is not baked via the addition of crumbs), we see that Q simply provides tantalizing and cryptic clues (not credible information or evidence gathered from high-level security clearance) that the internet then turns into a theory.Here's an excerpt from the ""QAnon Anonymous"" podcast (the full episode can be listened to here):Anons on [web forum] Qresear.ch feel like they are unlocking the secrets of Q. But in reality it's more like an improvisational game where they try to find a meaning that will go viral in the QAnon community or even beyond.On Qresear.ch there are people responsible for creating and maintaining threads where people post their comments for research. They're called ""bakers."" And these bakers are supposed to help the Anons take the bread crumbs and turn them into completed research called ""bread."" Let's be clear here. This is not how bread is made. Do not use bread crumbs to make bread.:In this manner, QAnon is an ever-shifting and growing ideology. Proponents of this theory can pick and choose which threads to follow and which ones to dismiss.What Is the 'Red Pill'?Subscribers to QAnon are often said to have taken the ""red pill."" This is a reference to ""The Matrix,"" a movie starring Keanu Reeves, in which the hero is presented with a choice: Take the red pill and see the world as it really is or take the blue pill and stay ignorant.:There is a fundamental flaw to this analogy, however, as ""The Matrix"" is a work of fiction. When Reeves takes the red pill, he doesn't see the world as it really is, but as the imaginary world that the filmmakers created. In this same way, QAnon believers who take the ""red pill"" are choosing to reject the reality brought to them by their eyes and ears and replace it with one of their own making.What Is the 'Deep State'?The term ""deep state"" has been around for decades and typically refers to a secret group of powerful government workers who are working against their own government. In the case of QAnon, the deep state can refer to just about anyone who poses a threat (or is perceived as a threat) to the Trump presidency.While QAnon's first posts featured political players such as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Podesta, and former U.S. President Barack Obama, the deep state has since incorporated business leaders such as Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Microsoft's Bill Gates, philanthropists such as George Soros, and celebrities such as Madonna, Ellen DeGeneres, and Tom Hanks. More recently, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and one of the leaders of the Trump administration's White House Coronavirus Task Force, was also subjected to deep state rumors.:Forbes writes:There is a growing sentiment that Fauci, who has served every President since Reagan and is a Presidential Medal of Freedom awardee, is part of the ""Deep State,"" a term used by many of the President's supports and other anti-government groups to represent what they see as a bias against Trump in the federal government. These conspiracy theorists claim that players in the Deep State have roles in the government that they exploit to actively work against the President's agenda, stymieing his efforts to ""drain the swamp"" and work on behalf of the American people. While many believers of the Deep State theory, including supporters of QAnon theories, believe the Deep State is made up of disgruntled Democrats, Newt Gingrich recently suggested there are plenty of Republicans in the Deep State as well. Fauci, by virtue of his longtime public service, and his willingness to contradict the President, many of these conspiracy theorists see Fauci as a prime example of a Deep State advocate thwarting the President's agenda.Where Is Q headed? What Is 'the Storm'?:One of the main tenets of QAnon is that one day soon ""the storm"" will arrive and all of Trump's enemies will be arrested. The term comes from an offhand remark Trump made before taking a photo with a group of generals.The vagueness of this odd statement left it open to interpretation. To some, it was just a silly remark. To QAnon, it was a secret code word to signal that mass arrests were imminent.:What Is the 'Great Awakening'?While QAnon may seem a bit dark -- with all of its talk about pedophilia, sex trafficking, and satanic rituals -- there is light at the end of this fictitious tunnel. The Great Awakening, a term borrowed from religious revivals throughout history, is the idea that after ""the storm"" we'll see a period of enlightenment as the evils of the deep state are destroyed.How Has QAnon Evolved?When QAnon first emerged, it was largely concerned with various political players connected to the 2016 presidential election. In the ensuing years, however, this conspiracy theory has seeped into all manners of political discourse. Elements of Q can be found spreading misinformation related to Black Lives Matter, vaccinations, and the COVID-19 pandemic.Brandy Zadrozny, an NBC News reporter whose health misinformation beat has been increasingly intertwined with QAnon, said that these conspiracy groups use nearly identical tactics to increase their reach and spread misinformation.:In a podcast interview with ""Lawfare,"" Zadrozny described two main tactics used by QAnon and the anti-vaccination movement. First, they create an enemy. Second, they create fear. The first item gives people something to rail against, while the second gives them a noble purpose for their cause.Zadrozny said:[QAnon and anti-vaccination groups] are almost exactly the same in terms of ideology and tactics. What's changed is the players, right? So take out John Podesta and Hillary Clinton and Obama and you can put in Dr. Fauci and Bill Gates and whoever your local county health policy maker is. And they are the bad guys, and you go after those bad guys relentlessly. You create these entire fantasies surrounding, if we're talking about anti-vaccination groups, around Bill Gates and Big Pharma and ""all of these children are dead."" There's a very pure reasoning behind this: ""We're out to save children,"" both groups say constantly. But what they're doing is leveraging social media to create these harassment campaigns against anyone who is against them. And again with tactics, they are both so so good at cross pollinating different groups who may also have a distrust of institutions.:[...]I have been saying it's like the ""boss"" level because before [...] one of us [reporters] would take political extremism, one of us could take medical or health extremism and misinformation and have out beats, but now they are just doing everything in a sort of lock-step. And the largest anti-vaccination group is very much a QAnon group, and so they have really managed to boost their numbers, and so has QAnon. They've both been able to feed on that distrust. And the distrust in institution is the thing that binds all conspiracy theories. That's what they have to keep going. This fear. Just supplying this fear in inordinate amounts. Whether it's the fear of your child being injured or killed with a vaccine, or your child being swept up in this sex trafficking ring. It really is just all so similar.What Does Trump Have to Say About This?Trump has retweeted content made by QAnon conspiracy theorists, but he has largely refrained from talking directly about Q. That is, until Aug. 19, 2020, when he was asked about the conspiracy theory during a press conference.The New York Times reported:President Trump on Wednesday offered encouragement to proponents of QAnon, a viral conspiracy theory that has gained a widespread following among people who believe the president is secretly battling a criminal band of sex traffickers, and suggested that its proponents were patriots upset with unrest in Democratic cities.""I've heard these are people that love our country,"" Mr. Trump said during a White House news conference ostensibly about the coronavirus. ""So I don't know really anything about it other than they do supposedly like me.""When told by a reporter about the central premise of the QAnon theory -- a belief that Mr. Trump is saving the world from a satanic cult made up of pedophiles and cannibals connected to Democratic Party figures, so-called deep-state actors and Hollywood celebrities -- Mr. Trump did not question the validity of the movement or the truth of those claims.Instead, he offered his help.""Is that supposed to be a bad thing or a good thing?"" the president said lightly, responding to a reporter who asked if he could support that theory. ""If I can help save the world from problems, I am willing to do it. I'm willing to put myself out there.""Let's end this article the same way we started it, with a simple question:What Is QAnon?Over the last few years, a section of the internet has been involved in a sort of ""game"" in which people extrapolate meaning from cryptic messages on internet forums posted by an anonymous person claiming to be a high-ranking government official known as ""Q."" While this supposed government insider has repeatedly made incorrect predictions, followers of QAnon have become convinced of a ""deep state"" cabal of satanic, baby-eating, child sex-traffickers led by prominent members of the Democratic party, and they believe Trump is the only one who can stop it. While this conspiracy theory was once relegated to the fringes of the internet, it has since made serious headway into mainstream politics. Despite being labeled as a threat by the FBI, supporters of QAnon have found some success in their efforts to seek political office, earning more than a half million collective votes and, arguably, receiving support from the highest office in government.QAnon is no longer a fringe conspiracy theory. It is a popular ideology that teaches people to reject reality and distrust institutions. While ""the storm"" may never arrive, Q is already here. "

They're now charging up to $600 for a two-EpiPen set that must be replaced every 12-18 months. This both increases out-of-pocket costs for families and first responders, and contributes to higher premiums for all Americans and their employers,"" Clinton said in a statement released to reporters by her campaign.""That's outrageous -- and it's just the latest troubling example of a company taking advantage of its consumers ... [I]t's wrong when drug companies put profits ahead of patients, raising prices without justifying the value behind themGiven that John Paladino worked at a funeral home and Carole Paladino was a retired school nurse, it's unlikely that either of them would have been testifying before a grand jury about the operations of a large pharmaceutical company. Moreover, prosecutors in Gloucester County have told news outlets (and reiterated to us) that foul play is not suspected in the Paladinos' deaths, so any ""news"" story attempting to link their demise to a deliberate and furtive criminal plot to keep the couple from testifying against Hillary Clinton is merely another iteration of the ""Clinton body bag"" rumor that has been disseminated online since Clinton's husband, Bill, was president back in the 1990s.:"

544,544,556.DidObamaOrdertheCIAt,"Claim:U.S. President Barack Obama ordered the CIA to train and/or arm Islamic State fighters.Rating:Mostly FalseAbout this rating What's TrueAccording to multiple reputable reports and investigations, a CIA program called Timber Sycamore provided training and weapons to Syrian rebels fighting against the regime of Bashar al-Assad, but some of those arms ultimately ended up in the hands of Islamic State fighters.What's FalseHowever, the theft and smuggling of the arms were unintended and not the result of a deliberate policy or instructions from President Barack Obama or any part of his administration, which actually set up a separate program to arm and train Syrian rebels to fight Islamic State, specifically. :In October 2019, after the reported death of the Islamic State group (IS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, some apparent supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump turned their focus towards his predecessor's record with regard to the terrorist network. Right-wing conspiracy theorists have long claimed, implied, or speculated that former President Barack Obama has questionable loyalty to the United States, or that he is a secret Muslim and even a secret militant Islamist. Trump himself has repeatedly promulgated such false allegations, including the birther conspiracy theory, and during the 2016 presidential campaign he described Obama, more than once, as the ""founder"" of IS. After the death of al-Baghdadi -- who reportedly detonated a suicide vest during a U.S. raid on a compound in Syria -- multiple social media users shared one article in particular: a 2015 post on NewsPunch, a website formerly known as YourNewsWire, which is known to publish junk news as well as sensationalist distortions of real news stories. The headline read ""Declassified Documents: Obama Ordered CIA to Train ISIS."" The article reported that::""Government watchdog Judicial Watch published more than 100 pages of formerly classified documents from the U.S. Department of Defense and the State Department. The documents obtained through a federal lawsuit revealed the agencies earlier views on ISIS, namely that they were a desirable presence in Eastern Syria in 2012 and that they should be 'supported' in order to isolate the Syrian regime.""The U.S. intelligence documents not only confirms [sic] suspicions that the United States and some of its coalition allies had actually facilitated the rise of the ISIS in Syria -- as a counterweight to the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad -- but also that ISIS members were initially trained by members and contractors of the Central Intelligence Agency at facilities in Jordan in 2012.""The NewsPunch article cited a few sources, including a 2015 article on the website Examiner.com, whose headline similarly claimed ""Obama Ordered CIA to Train ISIS Jihadists: Declassified Documents,"" and a 2015 AlterVista blog post. The Examiner.com article stated::""U.S. intelligence documents released to a government watchdog confirms [sic] the suspicions that the United States and some of its so-called coalition partners had actually facilitated the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) as an effective adversary against the government of the Syrian dictator President Bashar al-Assad. In addition, ISIS members were initially trained by members and contractors of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) at facilities in Jordan in 2012. The original goal was to weaken the Syrian government which had engaged in war crimes against their own people, according to a number of reports on Sunday.""The Examiner.com report also cited as a source the same AlterVista post, which stated ""The ISIS terrorists, who were initially trained by the CIA in Jordan in 2012 to destabilize the Syrian government, are engaged in crimes against humanity in the areas under their control."" Notably, that post was in reality a republication of a May 2015 article published by Press TV, Iran's state-funded television network. The claim that the CIA, under orders from Obama, had set out to train IS in 2012, was not actually contained or revealed in declassified U.S. Department of Defense documents, contrary to both NewsPunch's and Examiner.com's characterization. The claim instead originated in a report by an Iranian state-funded broadcaster. :Timber SycamoreInternal emails obtained by Judicial Watch through Freedom of Information Act requests included an August 2012 memo distributed to military, Defense, Homeland Security, FBI, and State Department officials, which gave a provisional outline of the circumstances surrounding, and participants involved in, the Syrian Civil War, as follows:""The Salafist, the Muslim Brotherhood, and AQI [Al Qaeda in Iraq] are the major forces driving the insurgency in Syria. The West, Gulf countries, and Turkey support the opposition, while Russia, China and Iran support the [Assad] regime.""Of particular relevance, that memo also included the following ""assumptions"" and predictions:7. A. The [Assad] regime will survive and have control over Syrian territory.B. Development of the current events into proxy war: With support from Russia, China and Iran, the regime is controlling the areas of influence along coastal territories...and is fiercely defending Homs, which is considered the primary transportation route in Syria. On the other hand opposition forces are trying to control the Eastern areas...adjacent to the Western Iraqi provinces...in addition to neighboring Turkish provinces. Western countries, the Gulf states and Turkey are supporting these efforts... [Emphasis added]:The memo thus indicated that Western countries, including the United States, were at that time supportive of the opposition to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. This was not a revelatory point in October 2019, nor in May 2015, when Judicial Watch published the internal documents, nor even in 2012, when the Obama administration openly and publicly declared its support for the rebels.The memo does not even mention U.S.-backed training of Syrian opposition forces, and certainly does not articulate a viewpoint that is pro-IS, or reflect a desire or intent, on the part of Obama himself or any part of his administration, to train, equip, bolster or facilitate IS.In fact, the very same memo, quoted so extensively in the articles mentioned above, actually cites the emergence of IS in Iraq as one of the potentially ""dire consequences"" of the instability caused by the Syrian Civil War, stating:8. D. The deterioration of the situation has dire consequences on the Iraqi situation and are as follows:1. This creates the ideal atmosphere for AQI to return to its old pockets in Mosul and Ramadi, and will provide a renewed momentum under the presumption of unifying the jihad among Sunni Iraq and Syria, and the rest of the Sunnis in the Arab world against what it considers one enemy, the dissenters. ISI [Islamic State of Iraq, a precursor to Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or IS] could also declare an Islamic State through its union with other terrorist organizations in Iraq and Syria, which will create grave danger in regards to unifying Iraq and the protection of its territory.:However, the United States did train and arm Syrian rebels, beginning in late 2012/early 2013. The program began as a covert CIA operation, but was later formalized and given the code name ""Timber Sycamore,"" although it remained classified. Trump ordered the operation to be closed down in 2017, according to reports.During its years of operation, Timber Sycamore reportedly saw hundreds of millions of dollars spent, annually, on arming and training thousands of anti-government Syrian rebels. That's largely what happened, but according to multiple reports and investigations, some of the arms provided to the rebels were stolen or traded and ended up on the black market in Syria, with some ultimately being acquired by IS fighters. That was an unfortunate and inadvertent consequence of the program, rather than its aim. Indeed, far from intending the program to be used to train or arm IS fighters, the Obama administration actually set up a separate initiative, with Congressional approval, specifically to train and equip Syrian rebels to fight against IS. The program was not a success and was shut down in 2015. :ConclusionBoth NewsPunch and Examiner.com claimed that Obama had ""ordered the CIA to train ISIS."" That's not what happened.According to multiple reports by reputable news organizations, the CIA (under the Obama administration) carried out a covert program of training and arming Syrian rebels to fight against the Assad regime. That's largely what the program achieved, too; but as a result of greed and corruption, some of the weapons supplied to the rebels were sold on to the black market, and some of those ended up in the hands of IS fighters. One could conduct a reasonable debate about the Obama administration's overall management of the program, its efforts to vet the intermediaries involved, or prevent foreseeable theft or smuggling of the weapons, and so on. But one cannot, based on the facts available, claim that Obama ""ordered the CIA to train IS."" He didn't.:Moreover, we know for a fact that he implemented a program that set out to do just the opposite -- training and equipping Syrian rebels to fight and destroy IS. "
545,545,550.ViralVideoofBidenDis,"Since July 2021, a viral video has made the rounds on Facebook, TikTok, and Twitter that appeared to show U.S. President Joe Biden asking CNN anchor Don Lemon, ""You got the vaccination?"" However, the 34-second clip was taken out of context from a longer answer that spanned well over two minutes. It came from a ""CNN Presidential Town Hall"" that occurred during the same year on July 21. The setting was Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati, Ohio.Viral on Social MediaFormer Newsmax TV host John Cardillo shared the out-of-context video days after it originally aired::The most-viewed post in which the out-of-context clip with Biden and Lemon was shared appeared to be on Facebook. The video was reposted in September 2021 by Clive Palmer, a billionaire businessman who is the founder of the right-wing United Australia Party. It was seen more than 2.4 million times and received nearly 50,000 likes and well over 44,000 shares. The clip was still being shared at least hundreds of times per day as of early March 2022. (Visit the link, scroll down to the post, and click the ""shares"" count to see recent shares.)The Facebook video showed the watermark of a TikTok user named @thecuddycamaro, an account that is no longer available. This means that the clip had been downloaded from TikTok and then reuploaded to Facebook. The TikTok user ended the video with a reference to Biden's remarks, saying: ""Who's running the country? Cause it's not this guy.""Full TranscriptThe transcript of the complete answer showed that Biden was briefly acting out a conversation between two people and was not asking Lemon at that specific moment if he, personally, had been vaccinated for COVID-19. Further, the Facebook and TikTok video placed a question mark next to the word ""interlockiders"" [sic]. Facebook users who shared the clip apparently thought Biden had made up the word. However, ""interlocutors"" is a real word that's defined as ""one who takes part in dialogue or conversation."":Here is the full question-and-answer sequence between Lemon and Biden. It can also be watched in its entirety beginning at the 16:15 moment in a video from CNN.com. The out-of-context portion that appeared in the viral videos is bolded to show just how much context was omitted:Don Lemon: Can I ask you something, Mr. President? Because, you know -- and, by the way, you got -- I don't know if you heard that you got applause when you corrected the ""I"" for ""we."" And we're talking about ""we,"" and I think that's --Joe Biden: Well, it is ""we.""Don Lemon: -- a commendable attribute to have. But even with my own family -- I was just able to get with them. I haven't seen my mom in a year and a half, except for two weeks ago. I hadn't seen my family for two years since the last time they visited me two summers ago. But even within my own family -- here I am on television every night -- there is ambivalence, there's misinformation, and there's also mistrust in the system. How do you fix that?Joe Biden: Well, I think -- you're going to -- this is going to seem like a non-answer to start with. One of the things I said when I ran for office -- it's not Democrat or Republican again -- is we got to restore faith in government. You got to get people to a point where they trust government.:And I made a commitment that when I made a mistake, I'd tell you I've made mistakes. And when I think I got it right, I'll say it. But I'll take responsibility for what I do and say.Part of it is just generally -- (applause) -- no, I don't mean that -- part of it is, generally, raising confidence in elected officials. Raising confidence. And I know this is going to sound like a non-answer to you, but part of this is that, you know -- you know because you're one of the most informed journalists in the country. You know the criticism I got when I said I'm going to unite the country. They said, ""You can't unite the country."" Well, if we can't unite the country, we can never get some of these problems solved.And that goes to trust. Why can't you unite the country? Why isn't there a willingness to trust? Government trust is really at a -- was at an incredibly low ebb. It's coming up some.So with regard to your family in particular. Part of it is not just that they see you on television and trust you; the people who seem to have the most impact are the -- are, you know, that -- for that 17-year-old kid, the kid that he or she plays ball with. (Begin Viral Video) ""You got the vaccination? Are you okay? I mean, you seem..."" ""No, it works."" Or you, you know -- or the mom and dad, or the neighbor, or when you go to church, or when you're -- no, I really mean it. :There are trusted interlocutors. Think of the people -- if your kid wanted to find out whether or not there were -- there's a man on the moon, or whatever -- you know, something, or, you know, whether those aliens are here or not -- you know, who are the people they talk to beyond the kids who love talking about it? (End Viral Video) They go to people they respect, and they say, ""What do you think?""And so they should be asking other people -- the people there -- everything from their teachers to their ministers to the priest, to people that they trust.The full program from CNN with Biden and Lemon can also be viewed on the TV News Archive on the Internet Archive.Cuddy CamaroIn a YouTube video from the same person who posted the out-of-context video to TikTok, Cuddy Camaro can be heard singing a song in which he called Biden a ""child-sniffing politician."" The tune included lyrics that appeared to reference the debunked QAnon conspiracy theory claiming that prominent Democrats are known pedophiles. For example, the lyrics said that former U.S. President Donald Trump was ""fighting pedophiles."" The song ended with: ""Save the women and children. Vote Trump 2020."":We reached out to TikTok to find out if the user was suspended from the platform for policy violations and will update this story if we receive a response.For further reading, previously reported on two other viral moments from the July 2021 CNN town hall."

These stories also document patterns of the shortcomings of social media platforms, in particular when it comes to U.S. politics.A Snopes investigation has uncovered a Facebook account, likely Russian, that managed a Pennsylvania for Trump Facebook group from April 2016 through October 2020. The discovery was made with only weeks remaining before the Nov. 3, 2020, general election.The Facebook account had participated in the group for the key swing state ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and its activity during that year paralleled descriptions of fake personas mentioned in the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee's report, ""Russian Active Measures Campaigns and Interference in the 2016 U.S. Election."" Following Donald Trump's victory in that election, the account created posts to defend Russia from accusations of foreign interference. We contacted Facebook with questions about the administrative account, and hours later it was no longer accessible.:""Gina Grin"" was the name on the admin account, and it may have been an alias. We will refer to her in this story as a woman, but the identity behind the account could not be definitively confirmed. She was still active around mid-October 2020, less than a month to go before Election Day. A second account named Gina Grin Scofield also vanished the same day. Facebook did not respond to our questions about either account.More than 6 million ballots were cast in Pennsylvania for the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Donald Trump edged out former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in that state by only 44,292 votes.The Pennsylvania for Trump Facebook group was created on March 23, 2016, and is now named Support Melania Trump. It secured the URL facebook.com/groups/MelaniaTrump. The group's original purpose was to gather support for Donald Trump in Pennsylvania. There was no indication that the Trump campaign had any involvement with it.:The above screenshot was captured in September 2020. In October, when the group had 115,000 members, an admin changed the group's visibility to ""Hidden,"" meaning that only current members could see that it exists. For that reason, Snopes reporters were not able to confirm if the group is still active today, and Facebook did not respond to us following the removal of the admin account.'Gina Grin'Gina Grin became a member of Pennsylvania for Trump (now named Support Melania Trump) on April 21, 2016. Out of all the admins, she had been active in the group the longest, including taking charge of posting group rules.At least two Facebook accounts were created under the name. The first was named Gina Grin, and snagged the Facebook URL facebook.com/gina.grin. The account had at least 1,400 followers, and was an admin in the Facebook group. The second account was named Gina Grin Scofield and had the Facebook URL facebook.com/gina.grinii. It had 564 followers and thousands of friends but was not a visible admin in the group. It appeared to be a backup account in case the first one was removed by Facebook, thus the ""ii"" at the end of ""gina.grinii."" Grin liked only two TV shows: ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" and ""The Ingraham Angle,"" both right-leaning and pro-Trump. She also liked pages for conservative commentators Dan Bongino, Charlie Kirk, Michelle Malkin, and Ben Shapiro, to name a few.:Both of Grin's accounts featured a profile picture of actress Willa Ford. LOS ANGELES, CA - MARCH 20: Actress Willa Ford arrives at the premiere of Starz's ""Magic City"" held at the Directors Guild of America on March 20, 2012 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images):Grin flipped the image horizontally, perhaps to make it more difficult to find with a reverse image search.:She pretended in the comments section to be the woman in the picture, and other commenters appeared to believe it. It's against Facebook's Community Standards to create inauthentic profiles. Grin also posted a photograph of two German Shepherd puppies and said they belonged to her, even going so far as to give them names and ages: ""Alpha (6mo) and Ace (~9mo), not siblings."":A reverse-image search on Google showed that the same photograph was found across a number of Pinterest boards. Further, a Google image search for ""german shepherd puppies siblings"" shows the same picture as the very first result.She shared a photo of a woman with red hair holding a large gun. Commenters complimented Grin, believing the woman in the picture was her, and she thanked them. In reality, the image appears on Pinterest and bears a Weapon Outfitters logo. Both accounts for Grin also posted this photograph of a woman posing with a gun, with Grin once again implying she was the person pictured.She also posted a broad story that claimed she lived in Pennsylvania, and the hashtag #WWG1WGA (standing for ""Where We Go One We Go All,"" the slogan of the QAnon conspiracy theory) appeared on her profile. In 2016, the group was named Pennsylvania for Trump. Support Melania Trump shows as the group name here, as the screenshot was captured in 2020.:We asked Darren L. Linvill, an associate professor in Clemson University's College of Behavioral, Social and Health Sciences, about the possibility that an old 2016 Russian influence account could still be alive today in a swing state Facebook group. ""None of this surprises me. The idea that an old IRA (Internet Research Agency) account, and I'm not saying that's what this is with any certainty, but the idea that hypothetically an old IRA account might be lurking somewhere where it had past influence from 2016 is not only plausible, I know it to be a thing.""Linvill's research has informed several U.S. intelligence and security agencies. The IRA is a Kremlin-backed Russian troll farm. According to The New York Times, in 2016 Russians in the IRA ""stole the identities of American citizens and spread incendiary messages on Facebook and other social media platforms to stoke discord on race, religion and other issues that were aimed at influencing voters.""He added that he's aware of several Russian Twitter accounts that were active in 2016 that are still available, but no longer post new tweets. ""Twitter just never removed them from being active in 2016."" Linvill and Clemson University created a Spot The Troll quiz in which participants are shown social media posts to see if they can ""decide whether it's from a legitimate account or an internet troll."":Russian ParallelsIn August 2020, The Associated Press reported that the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee had issued its fifth and final report on Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, detailing the extent to which Trump campaign officials had involvement in the matter:The Trump campaign's interactions with Russian intelligence services during the 2016 presidential election posed a 'grave' counterintelligence threat, a Senate panel concluded as it detailed how associates of Donald Trump had regular contact with Russians and expected to benefit from the Kremlin's help. [...] Russia launched an aggressive effort to interfere in the election on Trump's behalf. It says the Trump campaign chairman had regular contact with a Russian intelligence officer and that other Trump associates were eager to exploit the Kremlin's aid, particularly by maximizing the impact of the disclosure of Democratic emails hacked by Russian intelligence officers.The report detailed acts by the Glavnoye Razvedyvatelnoye Upravlenie, better known as the GRU, ""the foreign military intelligence agency of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation."":It is unclear if Gina Grin might have had any direct associations. Page 185 of the committee's report detailed the GRU-created fake personas ""Alice Donovan,"" ""Richard Gingrey,"" and ""Jason Scott,"" to name a few. One was used to create a DCLeaks Facebook page. In 2016, DCLeaks published leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee. Similar to the Pennsylvania for Trump/Support Melania Trump Facebook group, the report noted that ""[the DCLeaks] Facebook page itself did not appear to generate significant activity on the platform,"" but that ""the GRU tried to bolster the DCLeaks Facebook page with other, more established GRU personas."" It said that ""the use of these additional personas was likely intended to generate a broader audience and lend an aura of credibility to the DCLeaks entity.""Like the DCLeaks personas, the person or people who managed Gina Grin's accounts used her profiles to generate a broader audience to perhaps lend more credibility to the Facebook groups in which she participated. She also consistently commented under posts and was not shy about posting links to the hacked DNC emails.:In August 2020, the same month the committee issued its report, Snopes reporters first began noticing inauthentic behavior in the Support Melania Trump Facebook group. We observed that brand-new Facebook accounts, such as one named Rachel Alexander, were becoming members in the group the same day they joined the platform, posting photos of first lady Melania Trump with brief and sometimes poorly constructed captions.:Gina Grin's two accounts reeked of foreign fakery. Finding out more details about the origins of fake and foreign accounts can be a tough task. Facebook profiles sometimes only provide limited information to the public, though there are ways to find clues.First, one of Gina Grin's accounts appears to have made a revealing mistake. A person controlling the account clicked to like the page Molekuliarnaia diagnostika 2020, as well as the same page for 2021.This was significantly out of step with other page likes for Gina Grin. The vast majority of page likes for the two Gina Grin accounts concentrated on right-wing American politics. For example, recent page likes for the Gina Grin Scofield account included pages named 100% American, Americans Against The NFL, and The Hodgetwins. Molekuliarnaia diagnostika 2020 was the only Russian-language page out of hundreds of page likes.:The page Molekuliarnaia diagnostika 2021 is the hub for the Molecular Diagnostics conference in Moscow, described as ""the leading event in the field of molecular diagnostics and related science and medicine trends in Russia."" It is supported by The Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation.Second, we know that in 2016, Russians sought to access election systems in Pennsylvania. We also know that they staged rallies in the swing state. The New York Times reported that Russia created fake American Facebook profiles, in particular documenting the case of a fake Pennsylvania man named Melvin Redick. And The Washington Post reported that Trump won Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin ""by 0.2, 0.7 and 0.8 percentage points, respectively."":Third, on Oct. 13, 2020, Snopes reached out to Facebook about this story, and hours later, both Gina Grin accounts disappeared. In the email, we detailed the Moscow conference and other data. We also referenced a video that featured a woman speaking Russian. That video was the only one posted to a YouTube channel named Gina Grin, and other than that video, a Google search for ""Gina Grin"" (with quotes) showed no trace of any other people or aliases with the same name.In our conversation with Linvill, we shared some of the red flags associated with Gina Grin's Facebook account. He referenced the Internet Research Agency in his response.I'm not saying this is definitely an old IRA account, but it sure as hell, you know literally everything on this checklist you gave me of things that looked suspicious to you, yeah. Appeared to pretend to live in a swing state. Check. IRA did that. Posted a celebrity profile photo and pretend to be the pictured woman. Check. IRA did that. Mirrored the profile photo. Check. I know the IRA to continue to do that. Pretended to own dogs and used pictures from Pinterest. Check. They do that. Posted links to the DNC emails. Check. Check. Check. Posted consistently negative about Hillary Clinton. Obviously check. Shared reassurances for people [unsure of voting for Trump]... I mean like all of these, even and especially the one about accidentally having a Russian page in there (Molekuliarnaia diagnostika 2021). These are run by humans. They make mistakes. I've seen all kinds of errors made by the Russians.:We also spoke with Nina Jankowicz, who studies disinformation with The Wilson Center, and is the author of ""How to Lose the Information War: Russia, Fake News, and the Future of Conflict."" We shared some of our research, and she told us that it's ""definitely suspicious that someone like this would like a Molecular Diagnostics conference page, especially if they purport to be in Pennsylvania, very strange, and you wonder if they were perhaps logged into Facebook under the troll account, and hadn't moved back to their personal account.""She said that while she has run into accounts like these that are run by American citizens, the ""pattern of posting"" for this one sounds like it stands out. ""They made it look like a real person's account that is populated by normal Facebook posts."" She also told us: ""It seems to me that, there are a lot of [sleeper accounts] that fall through the cracks and this one seems to have been pretty robust. Even if this was an account based in the United States, and this person was of Russian descent, or something like that, it still seems to be a fake account and violates Facebook's terms of service for misrepresentation. I think they need to do a lot better in these cases."":It is unknown how far Gina Grin's reach stretched out onto the vast Facebook landscape before both accounts were removed on Oct. 14. The person who controlled the accounts may have access to other profiles, though we were unable to find any evidence of additional accounts. What we do know for sure is that Grin was a member of at least nine Facebook groups more than four years earlier in May 2016, including Pennsylvania for Trump, the original name of the group before it was changed to Support Melania Trump. Grin was also an admin in the group New York's Trump Train Picking Up America!! until October 2020, and was a member of Wisconsin for Trump. Wisconsin is also a swing state.Page 80 of the Senate Intelligence Committee's report noted that ex-Trump campaign official Rick Gates recalled an Aug. 2, 2016, conversation between Konstantin Kilimnik and ex-Trump aide Paul Manafort, and that ""Kilimnik wanted to know how Trump could win."" Four states were specifically mentioned by Manafort as ""battleground"" states: Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.The 2016 U.S. Presidential Election:Gina Grin posted more times in the Facebook group in 2016 than in any year to follow. In Pennsylvania for Trump, she shared at least 110 posts between April 21 and Election Day, Nov. 8. As reported by The Associated Press, Russian efforts were underway ""to interfere in the election on Trump's behalf.""Grin joined Pennsylvania for Trump (now Support Melania Trump) on April 21, 2016. On the same day, she made her first post, featuring a poll showing that Donald Trump was trending to win the Republican primary. Eight days later, she shared a story from Conservative Treehouse that purported to show U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz's campaign ""collapsing."" The blog called the ""Never Trump"" campaign ""ridiculous"" and said of Cruz: ""He's just not a likable man."" Grin also posted a Conservative Tribune story: ""BREAKING: 1 Hillary Email SHOWED Terrorists How to Kill Amb. Chris Stevens.""According to the Senate intelligence committee report, April 2016 was the same month that ex-Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos ""likely learned about the Russian active measures campaign from Joseph Mifsud."":The Committee found Mifsud was aware of an aspect of Russia's active measures campaign in the 2016 election and that Mifsud told Papadopoulos what he knew. The timing of Mifsud's visit to Moscow and his subsequent conversation with Papadopoulos are consistent with the timeline of the GRU's cyber penetration of the DNC and DCCC, several weeks before any information about that activity was public. Furthermore, the information Mifsud conveyed to Papadopoulos was consistent with the GRU's information disclosure operations intended to damage the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.The Republican-led committee's report also noted: ""Mifsud played a central role in Papadopoulos's attempts to engage the Russian government on behalf of the Trump Campaign.""By June, Gina Grin was posting more often. Page 80 of the Senate Intelligence Committee's report noted:""Information suggests Kilimnik understood that some of the polling data showed that Clinton's negatives were particularly high; that Manafort's plan for victory called for focusing on Clinton's negatives as much as possible; and that given Clinton's high negatives, there was a chance that Trump could win."":In June, Grin shared negative stories about ""Crooked Hillary"" and so-called ""Clinton Foundation Scandals."":She also posted about Trump's polling with Black voters and stories from the far-right Gateway Pundit. One of Grin's shares attempted to ease the minds of Republicans who were unsure of voting for Donald Trump: ""If you're voting for Donald Trump but you're feeling anxiety about it, here's why you can relax and vote with enthusiasm. Read this and you will feel much better."" Another 2016 share mentioning Rush Limbaugh also attempted to reassure voters of Trump's candidacy.On July 13, 2016, Gina Grin posted: ""The surge begins - Go Trump!,"" linking to the Politico story that referenced Pennsylvania: ""Swing-state stunner: Trump has edge in key states."" Near the end of the month, she shared ""The Hillary Recession,"" a story from the conservative blog Townhall. In the same month, then-presidential candidate Trump said: ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 [Hillary Clinton] emails that are missing."" Leading into August 2016, Grin shared negative, back-to-back posts about Muslim peoples. Breitbart stories were common on Grin's timeline, and often shared to the group as well. She posted to her profile a reference to Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin in a small group called Bernie to Trump, with the headline: ""Putin: Hacked Emails Reveal That Clinton Threatened Sanders' Wife."" She shared a long debunked ""Clinton kill list,"" falsely claiming that Bill and Hillary Clinton had arranged for all 66 people on the list to be murdered. Also in August, she shared a meme from Joe Walsh that said: ""I remain much more bothered by what Hillary has done than by what Trump has said.""Gina Grin did not post in Pennsylvania for Trump between Aug. 25 and Oct. 12. It is not known why she was absent, but her return to the group occurred only six days after the Access Hollywood tape , in which Trump could be heard making demeaning sexual remarks about women, was released.In October 2016, Grin pushed on her profile a conspiracy theory about George Soros, a wealthy backer of liberal causes. She also shared three different stories that bore similarities to three Snopes debunkings published in 2016. One of the false stories said Ohio and Pennsylvania voters were called ""white trash"" in a ""leaked [Democratic National Committee] email."" Later in the month, she posted in Pennsylvania for Trump that she received a letter that was ""sent and paid by the PA Democratic Party.""Grin claimed: ""They are targeting suburban moms like me with propaganda and lies to scare them into voting for Hillary."" A Google cache archive with the full post showed she shared her message to the Ban the Democratic Party page. One sentence in her post contained what were perhaps some telling grammatical errors, including ""call Christmas a Christmas,"" ""stomping the American flag,"" and the absence of the word ""the"" before ""NFL tolerates disrespect"":""I have a problem explaining to my children why it is offensive to call Christmas a Christmas, why burning and stomping the American flag is not a punishable crime, and why NFL tolerates disrespect to our National Anthem.""On Nov. 1, Grin posted a story that claimed: ""Hillary's campaign manager is a Russian puppet!"" On Nov. 2, Grin posted to the group that ""intel operatives"" in the United States leaked the Clinton campaign emails, ""not Russia."" The source was the conspiracy theory website Infowars, and it was not the only Infowars story she shared that day. Grin also posted a link to a story falsely claiming an indictment was imminent for Hillary Clinton.In the final days of the campaign, Grin shared a Fox News story themed on Philadelphia, plus stories from Sean Hannity's website, Hannity.com, and 100PercentFedUp.com. On Nov. 7, the day before the election, Grin shared to her profile a post that read: ""BOOM!!!! REMEMBER, we need EVERY #TRUMPVOTER to turn out tomorrow!!! #Pennsylvania."" On the same day, she also posted to the group a story about health insurance premiums rising ""by roughly 33 percent on average under Hillary Clinton."" She also encouraged evangelicals to find friends to vote for Trump.In the early morning hours of Nov. 9, 2016, Donald Trump was declared the winner in the U.S. presidential election.Downplaying Russian InterferenceOn Dec. 11, 2016, Grin posted to her profile that ""the pathetic Left blames Russians for hacking the election for Trump"" and that: ""In the liberal mind, the Russians make the best scapegoat."" On the same day, she said that blaming Russia makes ""zero sense."" The next day she posted: ""I voted for Trump - not Putin."" Grin also said that Obama talking about Russia was him ""trying to delegitimize the man taking his place.""On Dec. 16, Grin posted a link to Infowars, claiming the story ""rips apart the narrative that Putin directly ordered Russian 'hacking' in the 2016 U.S. election."" She also linked to a story from American Thinker, and in doing so, continued to attempt to defend Russia following the 2016 U.S. presidential election. More stories over the coming days mentioned Russia, Pennsylvania, and Putin.The 2018 Midterm ElectionGina Grin's account also showed involvement in the 2018 midterm elections. In October, the account posted memes like this one referring to bombs, featuring U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters and former President Barack Obama. Another meme featured Democratic Party politicians with Soros, with the words: ""They tried pipe bombs, whores, Russia collusion, migrant caravans. But they cannot stop the RED WAVE.""In November, another meme posted by Grin encouraged the ""Red Wave,"" meaning the hope of a big wave of Republican voters. Another meme, posted after Democrats gained control of the U.S. House of Representatives, demanded a recount.Support for 'We Build The Wall'On Dec. 19, 2018, the likely Russian admin account operating under the name Gina Grin showed support for We Build The Wall, a fundraising effort for privately funded border wall construction on the U.S.-Mexico border. She told followers and friends, ""it's legit,"" directing them to ""USE #GoFundTheWall as a hashtag on social media,"" and shared the direct link to the GoFundMe page.On Dec. 31, 2018, Grin posted again about the charity, this time with some grammatical errors: ""Brian Kolfage's is not afraid of the death threats. His Wall GoFundMe raises $18,449,708. I hope he decides to run for Congress soon.""In August 2020, prosecutors arrested and charged Kolfage, former Trump White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, and others with scheming to defraud donors to fund their personal expenses and lifestyles.The Loss of Bre PaytonIn December 2018, Gina Grin politicized the tragic death of conservative writer Bre Payton. Payton wrote for The Federalist and made numerous appearances on Fox News Channel.Grin posted: ""On Friday, December 28, the 26-year-old The Federalist reporter suddenly died of the H1N1 flu. Coincidence or...not. Earlier, on December 13, Bre Payton broke a story about Mueller destroying text messages. The story was published in The Federalist.""Grin's attempt to push an outlandish conspiracy theory led to hundreds of shares, likely resulting in thousands of Facebook users seeing the post. One commenter responded to Grin, saying: ""Someone kill that fuck Mueller.""In fact, The Associated Press reported on Dec. 29, 2018, that Payton ""died suddenly"" after doctors determined that she ""had H1N1 flu -- also known as swine flu -- and meningitis."" The conspiracy theory pushed by Grin implied foul play. That conspiracy theory was false.The 2020 U.S. Presidential ElectionIn all of 2019, Gina Grin only posted seven times in the Support Melania Trump Facebook group, formerly known as Pennsylvania for Trump. On Jan. 1, 2020, Grin appeared to begin preparations for the 2020 U.S. presidential election, posting a new group cover photo on New Year's Day. She also posted, in part: ""As a reminder, the purpose of this group is to endorse and support Melania Trump as our First Lady in all of her undertakings.""On March 28, she announced group rules. This was the same month the first spike of COVID-19 cases began in the U.S. A screenshot of Grin's photos shows that she pushed memes about Dr. Anthony Fauci and a debunked conspiracy theory that claimed the novel coronavirus was created in a Wuhan, China, lab. She appeared to question the veracity of the U.S. COVID-19 death toll, and falsely claimed that COVID-19 stood for ""Chinese Originated Viral Infectious Disease"" (in reality, ""CO"" stands for the word ""corona,"" ""VI"" for ""virus,"" and ""D"" for ""disease"").On May 25, 2020, a Black man named George Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for roughly nine minutes. In the following days and weeks, the world saw chaotic demonstrations protesting racism and killings by police. The likely Russian Gina Grin account made several postings in response. She posted a meme that played on a Facebook feature used by people to mark themselves safe after potentially deadly events such as mass shootings and tsunamis. It read: ""Marked safe from white guilt."" Her memes also mocked the idea of Black Lives Matter, the name of the movement protesting police brutality. ""Here's your hero,"" read another meme that showed a picture of George Floyd and a list of his purported past offenses. One meme was a screenshot of a @NYPDTips tweet, with a caption from Grin that read: ""Yeah, the police are always picking on us.""She also called U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts a ""POS"" (likely because of these June 2016 votes), and supported pre-election proceedings to nominate Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court. In addition to sharing photos of the first lady as well as various news stories about her, Grin would often post about removing trolls from the group.Grin appeared to be an active commenter throughout 2020 and posted a significant number of times on her own profiles. However, her accounts had been much more active in the Facebook group four years earlier, sharing 11 times as many posts in the group in 2016 as she did in 2020.'Veteran of the First Gulf War'Gina Grin was not the only admin in the Facebook group. A person identified as Warren Potter joined the group on May 27, 2016, a little over a month after Grin became a member. In a Jan. 10, 2018 post, Potter acknowledged the work done by Gina Grin. We reached out to Potter about his experiences in the group, and he told us: ""I can assure you there is absolutely no foreign influence in the Support Melania Trump group. I am very much an American as are all of the moderators and admin in the group. I as a former Boy Scout, veteran of the first Gulf War and a truck driver am as American as you can get.""He also told us that a friend originally created the group, and that this friend eventually left Facebook because of ""censorship."" Gina Grin once posted a name next to the Pennsylvania for Trump group: Jeff Vince. This may have been Potter's friend.Another admin account named Dale Greenland joined the group at 12:01 a.m. on Aug. 20, 2020, and appeared to become an admin on the same day. Other group managers included Susy Torres and Ron Conard.Facebook Goes QuietSnopes reporters noticed in early October 2020 that the Support Melania Trump Facebook group appeared to be unavailable. On Oct. 11, Snopes reached out to Facebook, asking if the platform had taken action on the group. On Oct. 13, Facebook responded, saying that no action had been taken on Support Melania Trump.This was the only response that Snopes received from Facebook for this story.Snopes independently confirmed that the Support Melania Trump Facebook group, formerly named Pennsylvania for Trump, was still active. It had not been removed. An admin had switched the group's visibility to ""Hidden,"" meaning that only members could find it. Admin Potter claimed that the group was switched to this status to slow the flow of new members and pending posts since admins didn't have time to manage the group as it grew larger and larger. ""All of the admins have jobs and families and none of us have the countless hours it takes to do it.""Snopes reached out to Facebook again later in the day on Oct. 13, asking about Gina Grin's accounts and the connections to Russia, adding that the group was once targeted at swing state voters in Pennsylvania. As mentioned before, Gina Grin's accounts disappeared hours after we sent this second email to Facebook. Facebook appeared to have removed both accounts.In two later emails on Oct. 15 and 16, we asked Facebook if Support Melania Trump was still active, since there is no way of knowing, without being a member, if a hidden group is still active. We also asked if Facebook had a statement regarding the accounts for Gina Grin. Facebook did not respond to either email.In our conversation with Nina Jancowicz, she said that she believes Facebook groups are the ""underexplored angle on all of foreign interference right now,"" and that ""it's underexplored, in part, because the platforms make it really difficult to explore.""The group admin hid the group, so it was a secret group, and if you're not in the group you can't see what's going on in it. [...] In reality, it's still relying on user reports to be tipped off about that data, and so without researchers or reporters that are looking at this stuff, there's a lot that they won't find.Jancowicz added: ""Things like this are really difficult to track, and we shouldn't be doing Facebook's work for them."" In the past, journalists have exposed accounts, pages, and groups that violate the company's Community Standards. We asked her if Facebook perhaps lacks a proactive approach to finding content that violates its policies. She told us she believes the platform ""just does not have the capacity or perhaps the political will, in some cases, to do this active research, basically.""Gina Grin's accounts disappeared only after Snopes asked Facebook about their likely connection to Russia, and this was only 20 days before the 2020 U.S. presidential election. One of the accounts was an admin in an American swing state Facebook group for more than four years, across nearly two U.S. presidential elections and one midterm. One of Grin's viral disinformation posts was shared 149,000 times. It was even fact-checked by FactCheck.org and cited in a Utah Law Review paper.It's likely that the activity created by Gina Grin's accounts reached millions of Americans between 2016 and 2020."
547,547,67.DidBarackObamaTweetA,"Claim:Former President Barack Obama tweeted: ""Ask Ukraine if they found my birth certificate.""Rating:FalseAbout this rating One of the things former President Barack Obama was known for while in office was engaging in corny quips termed ""dad jokes,"" many of them self-deprecating. So to some people, it may not have seemed out of the realm of possibility in October 2019 that he would have lobbed a ""dad joke"" on Twitter that invoked the past conspiracy theories about his place of birth and a current scandal involving his White House successor and Ukraine.:The tweet, dated October 4, 2019, was an apparent forgery, as we found no evidence that the 44th president posted it from his account:The fake tweet was a play on an impeachment inquiry spearheaded by Democratic members of the House of Representatives over allegations that President Donald Trump had attempted to extort damaging information on a political rival from Ukraine by withholding military aid to that country.:As well, the ""birth certificate"" reference riffed on the ""birther"" conspiracy theory, the discredited notion proffered by some (including Donald Trump) that Obama was born in Kenya and not the United States, thereby disqualifying him from holding the U.S. presidency."
548,548,588.DeadlyDoublePearlHar,"A new book released to coincide with the 75th anniversary of the 7 December 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor not only purported to offer the ""definitive"" account of the battle that provoked the United States' entry into World War II, but it also, teasingly, repeated an arcane conspiracy theory associated with the attack that rarely makes it into the history books.On page 151 of Craig Nelson's Pearl Harbor: From Infamy to Greatness (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2016), within a timeline of events that occurred on both sides of the Pacific in the weeks leading up to the bombardment of the U.S. fleet in Hawaii, the following one-paragraph anecdote appears:On November 22, a strange  appeared in the New Yorker magazine. It pictured a group of people sheltered from an air raid, playing dice. Under the headline ""Achtung, Warning, Alerte!"" the copy read, ""We hope you'll never have to spend a long winter's night in an air-raid shelter, but we were just thinking ... it's only common sense to be prepared. If you're not too busy between now and Christmas, why not sit down and plan a list of the things you'll want to have on hand. ... And though it's no time, really, to be thinking of what's fashionable, we bet that most of your friends will remember to include those intriguing dice and chips which make Chicago's favorite game: THE DEADLY DOUBLE."" Scattered throughout the issue were six smaller tag ads referring back to the main copy, with the dice numbered 12 and 7, numbers on no known dice. Later during the war, navy transport pilot Joseph Bell was flying a South Pacific route when one of is passengers, an intelligence officer, told him that many in intelligence considered this ad a secret warning. He had been assigned to investigate the matter, but every lead had led to a dead end -- the ad's copy had been presented in person at the magazine's offices, and the fee paid with cash. Neither the game offered in the ad, nor the company that purported to make it, ever existed.::The s Nelson speaks of were real, albeit bizarre and to all appearances inexplicable. ""It's a mystery to this day,"" Nelson mused during an interview with Time magazine on 6 December 2016. In truth, however -- as we shall show -- the mystery was laid to rest long ago.A 'very real malevolence'As stated in his book, Nelson's account was based on that of former serviceman Joseph Bell, who had written of his own encounter with the ""Deadly Double"" mystery in the 7 December 1989 edition of the Los Angeles Times. Bell, a Navy pilot during World War II, recalled meeting a military intelligence officer who shared with him a story ""he probably shouldn't have"":He told me that the Nov. 22, 1941, issue of the New Yorker magazine -- two weeks before the attack on Pearl Harbor -- an  that in retrospect was full of double meanings and was considered by the intelligence community as a warning to someone about the timing of the upcoming Japanese offensive. He described the ad as best he could from memory and said it was accompanied by a pair of dice with the numbers 12 and 7 -- the date of the Pearl Harbor attack -- exposed.He had been assigned to investigate the ad and ran into nothing but dead-ends. It had been placed across the counter in New York and paid for in cash. Both the main ad and the smaller lead-in ads had been set in type somewhere else and a matrix pulled for delivery to the New Yorker. The clerk who had accepted the ads had no recollection of who placed them, and neither the game that was offered in the double-entendre copy nor the company whose signature was on the ad existed. So my friend had drawn a total blank, and it was still eating at him. He was convinced that someone -- for reasons he couldn't fathom -- had been instructed to convey information about the upcoming attack in this manner.:When he returned to college after the end of war, Bell wrote, he looked for the ads among the bound volumes of New Yorker magazines in the library. He found them. They were just as they had been described to him. And they were haunting:I remembered the assurances of the intelligence officer that there was no such company and no such game in the stores, and the ads took on a significance -- and a malevolence -- to me that has been very real ever since.'A set of cryptic s';The last time the ads had been covered in the news media was in 1967, when military historian Ladislas Farago shared the story in a press release to promote his book, The Broken Seal: ""Operation Magic"" and the Secret Road to Pearl Harbor.""The date, time and location of the Japanese surprise bombing of Pearl Harbor may have been contained in a set of cryptic s published in the New Yorker magazine 16 days before the attack,"" reported The New York Times on 12 March 1967::According to Lasislas Farago, a former United States intelligence expert and military historian, the ads may have served to alert Japanese agents here that it was time to disband their apparatus.... The first  was set in one column and was two inches deep. It showed a pair of dice with six numerals written on their faces. There were the numbers 12 and 7, which Mr. Farago says could have stood for the month and day of the attack.The figures 5 and 0 may have been the planned time for the bombing, which did not being until 7 a.m. A double X, or Roman numeral 20, appears on another face of the die, and Mr. Farago said that this could have been meant to signify the approximate latitude of Pearl Harbor.The number 24 appears on the sixth face and, Mr. Farago said in an interview, ""I haven't any idea what that could mean.""'Deadly Double' creator revealedFarago found himself with a fair amount of crow to eat the next day, when the Times published a follow-up article identifying the creator, publisher, and advertiser of the game -- which did exist -- as Roger Paul Craig, whose widow had contacted the paper to set the record straight::A woman who says she is the widow of the man who invented a game called ""The Deadly Double"" denied that s for the game published in 1941 carried any warning of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.The woman, Mrs. E. Shaw Cole of Montclair, N.J., disputed the suggestion that the ads had been designed to alert Japanese agents in this country.... Mrs. Cole said she had helped her late husband, Roger Paul Craig, write the cryptic ads. She said the ads had been designed as ""teasers"" to promote the game.One ad carried the headline ""Achtung!"" The other showed a group of people playing a dice game in an underground air raid shelter while searchlights and explosions lit the sky above.Mrs. Cole said that she and her late husband were visited by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation after Pearl Harbor but that the relationship of the ads to the attack was just ""one big coincidence.""She said she had no idea how her husband happened to pick the numbers.Asked to comment, Farago could only say, ""What can I say?"" (Interestingly, though Farago had mentioned ""The Deadly Double"" story in his press release, he did not include it in his book. An editor for the book's publisher, Doubleday, said the story was omitted because it was ""inconclusive"" and ""not hard information.""):'A grossly inaccurate and malicious rumor'Digging deeper, we discovered that the ""mystery"" of the prophetic dice game had actually been solved decades earlier, in May 1942 (five months after Pearl Harbor), when Los Angeles Times columnist Chapin Hall tracked Mr. Craig down and quizzed him about the s:Propaganda develops some odd reactions. It is a two-edged sword that may turn unexpectedly. An interesting example is the story of what happened to the promoters of a new game which was put on the market last fall with a fanfare of national advertising.One of these s appeared in the New Yorker magazine for Nov. 22. In it the words ""alerte"" and ""warning"" were used and the unpleasant possibility was suggested of a ""long winter night spend in an air-raid shelter.""Two weeks later came Pearl Harbor, following which, for some inexplicable reason, a lot of people turned back to the out-of-date issue of the magazine, apparently obsessed with the idea that the  contained a prophecy of the tragedy in the Pacific.:Letters, calls and telegrams in profusion started coming in to the office of the company and to the editors of the magazine from would-be J. Edgar Hoovers and amateur G-men demanding an explanation of what they described as a tip-off to all loyal Japs in the United States and its possessions to make arrangements for protection from a surprise attack.""If these seem farfetched,"" Roger Paul Craig, an officer of the company, tells us, ""you should see the complicated evidence that was marshaled to show that the numbers on the dice which the game (the Deadly Double) is played clearly announced the date of the forthcoming attack, 12-7. In other acrostic arrangements of the visible numerals, together with incongruous calculations based on the number of s and the page numbers in the magazine, an additional code message to alleged Axis agents was read into the copy.""The undertone of bitterness and sarcasm in Craig's comments is understandable. His wife was later quoted as saying the game never sold well, despite the notoriety it attracted. In the end, Craig felt victimized:Just how such a message was supposed to reach all the sons of the Rising Sun through such a medium is difficult to understand, but the message did carry into every section of the country, ""and I promise you,"" said Mr. Craig, ""nothing travels as far and fast as a grossly inaccurate and malicious rumor."":One final note, to prove, if nothing else, that real life abhors a tidy ending: According to his widow, ""Deadly Double"" inventor Roger Paul Craig went on to serve in the Office of Strategic Services, the military progenitor of the CIA, during World War II."
549,549,466.MassiveStoneAgeTunne,"Claim:Stone Age tunnels have been found that stretch thousands of miles all the way from Scotland to Turkey.Rating:MixtureAbout this rating What's TrueMedieval Erdstall tunnels dating back centuries have been found in places such as Germany, Austria, France, Ireland and Scotland.What's FalseThese tunnels comprise a continuous passageway all the way from Scotland to Turkey. :Since at least 2011, web sites dedicated to spreading rumors about spirits and the underworld have been claiming that a connected ""network"" of tunnels dating back to the Stone Age and stretching across Europe from Scotland to Turkey has been discovered.The yarn has wended its way across conspiracy theory sites and hubs of fiction such as Ancient-Code.com and SimpleCapactiy.com:Across the Europe there are thousands of underground tunnels from the north in Scotland leading all the way down to the Mediterranean.This 12,000-year-old massive underground network is very impressive.Some experts believe the network was a way of protecting man from predators while others suggest the idea that the linked tunnels were used like motorways are today, for people to travel safely regardless of wars or violence or even weather above ground. They could be described as a kind of ancient underground superhighway.Others think the tunnels can be seen as a gateway to the underworld.:The story seems to have originated from a gross misinterpretation of a 2011 article in the German news magazine Der Spiegel that detailed mysterious tunnels found throughout parts of Europe known as ""Erdstall."" The myth version also references the work of a German prehistorian, Heinrich Kusch, who along with his wife Ingrid authored a 2009 German-language book about the Erdstall tunnels. The Kusches believed the tunnels were built 5,000 (not 12,000) years ago, and scientific evidence places Erdstall at an even more recent timeframe than the Kusches suspected:A few radiocarbon dating analyses have also been performed, and they indicate that the galleries date back to the 10th to the 13th century. Bits of charcoal recovered from the Erdstall tunnels in Hocherlmuhle date back to the period between 950 and 1050 A.D.The Erdstall tunnels are not an interconnected highway between Scotland and Turkey (which would have required people with rudimentary tools to dig a tunnel under the North Sea or the English Channel to reach mainland Europe). The tunnels comprise multiple unconnected passageways that have been found mainly in Germany, Austria, France, Ireland and Scotland::As a result of the international cooperation of the Erdstall working group, new clues have come to light. The galleries are also concentrated in parts of Ireland and Scotland, and there are also clusters in central France.This distribution bears intriguing parallels to the routes of the Irish-Scottish traveling monks who, coming from the Celtic north in the 6th century, traveled across the continent as missionaries. The tattooed monks made the passage to the continent from the islands, carrying long staffs and wearing coarse habits.The legendary Kilian, born in Ireland around 640 A.D., preached in the southern German city of Wurzburg. According to a hagiography, angry natives killed him and buried him in a stable. St. Gall (died 640 A.D.) made it as far as Lake Constance.Ahlborn speculates that these early Christian missionaries also brought along heathen ideas, the remnants of Druid scholarship or special Celtic concepts of the afterlife, which led to the construction of the subterranean galleries.While there isn't evidence that Erdstall tunnels have been discovered as far east as Turkey, large and sophisticated underground cities in that country's Cappadocia region have been unearthed and explored in recent years, perhaps the most famous of which is Derinkuyu::In 2013, construction workers demolishing low-income homes ringing [a Byzantine-era hilltop castle in Nevsehir] discovered entrances to a network of rooms and tunnels. The city halted the housing project, called in archaeologists and geophysicists, and began investigating ...In 2014, those tunnels led scientists to discover a multilevel settlement of living spaces, kitchens, wineries, chapels, staircases, and bezirhane--linseed presses for producing lamp oil to light the underground city. Artifacts including grindstones, stone crosses, and ceramics indicate the city was in use from the Byzantine era through the Ottoman conquest.Like Derinkuyu, the site appears to have been a large, self-sustaining complex with air shafts and water channels. When danger loomed, Cappadocians retreated underground, blocked the access tunnels with round stone doors, and sealed themselves in with livestock and supplies until the threat passed.While the underground labyrinths in Turkey were relatively advanced and were used to shelter residents from danger, the purpose of the European Erdstall tunnels is still mysterious. Unlike the underground structures in Turkey, where a 300-year old Ottoman paper trail guided modern researchers to key infrastructure, there are no written records about the Erdstall tunnels in Europe. According to Der Spiegel, there is disagreement as to whether they were shelters from marauders and robbers, spaces for perceived spirits or souls of the dead, or even toilets. Except for a few seemingly random items such as an iron plowshare and a few millstones, the tunnels are not just empty but ""swept clean,"" which seems to add to the mystery of their purpose.:While research on these archaeological phenomena is bound to continue and more answers may be forthcoming, we found no credible evidence of the existence of a 12,000-year-old subterranean highway system stretching from Scotland through mainland Europe, all the way to Turkey."
550,550,286.DidAnthonyKennedyRes,"Claim:Justice Anthony Kennedy suddenly resigned from the Supreme Court as part of a deal to shield his son from ongoing Russian investigations.Rating:UnprovenAbout this rating Any occasion on which a member of the U.S. Supreme Court leaves the bench through retirement (or death) is a significant political event, providing the incumbent president with the opportunity to nominate a successor who is ideologically congruent with the party in power and (in most cases) will remain on the bench for decades to come.  The requirement that a Supreme Court nominee be confirmed by a vote of the U.S. Senate often touches off bitter fights between the two parties on the floor of that chamber.:When Justice Anthony M. Kennedy announced his imminent retirement at the end of June 2018, it set the stage for a particularly momentous shift in the makeup of the Supreme Court, as Kennedy had long been the bridge between the court's liberal and conservative sides on a number of contentious social issues: Justice Kennedy, 81, has been a critical swing vote on the sharply polarized court for nearly three decades as he embraced liberal views on gay rights, abortion and the death penalty but helped conservatives trim voting rights, block gun control measures and unleash campaign spending by corporations.His replacement by a conservative justice -- something Mr. Trump has vowed to his supporters -- could imperil a variety of landmark Supreme Court precedents on social issues where Justice Kennedy frequently sided with his liberal colleagues, particularly on abortion.Many critics still smarting over the Republicans' successful (and unprecedented) efforts at blocking approval of Merrick Garland, who had been nominated by outgoing president Barack Obama in 2016 after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia -- thus allowing incoming president Donald Trump the opportunity to fill the vacant court seat instead -- immediately jumped on a conspiracy theory involving the timing of Kennedy's resignation and his son's employment::::The details of this conspiracy theory were somewhat hazy, most versions of it seemingly implying that President Trump somehow leveraged his financial connections with Kennedy's son Justin to convince or coerce the jurist to retire ahead of the November 2018 U.S. mid-term elections (during which Democrats might pick up enough Senate seats to block confirmation of Trump's preferred nominee).  The most coherent form of the conspiracy theory posited that Kennedy's retirement was a sudden and unexpected event, a strategic move intended to allow Trump to nominate a friendly successor who would vote favorably on any issues involving Justin Kennedy that might come before the court as a result of the ongoing Mueller investigation into Russian election interference (whereas Kennedy would have to recuse himself from such issues if he remained on the bench)::As the New York Times noted, Donald Trump did have a business relationship with Deutsche Bank, where Justin Kennedy once worked (he left the company in 2009), that went back many years to a time when many other banks were leery of doing business with Trump:[Anthony Kennedy and Donald Trump] had a connection, one Mr. Trump was quick to note in the moments after his first address to Congress in February 2017. As he made his way out of the chamber, Mr. Trump paused to chat with the justice.""Say hello to your boy,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Special guy.""Mr. Trump was apparently referring to Justice Kennedy's son, Justin. The younger Mr. Kennedy spent more than a decade at Deutsche Bank, eventually rising to become the bank's global head of real estate capital markets, and he worked closely with Mr. Trump when he was a real estate developer, according to two people with knowledge of his role.During Mr. Kennedy's tenure, Deutsche Bank became Mr. Trump's most important lender, dispensing well over $1 billion in loans to him for the renovation and construction of skyscrapers in New York and Chicago at a time other mainstream banks were wary of doing business with him because of his troubled business history.:And, of course, many news outlets have reported on the potentially suspect coincidence that right about the time Trump was sworn in as U.S. president, Deutsche Bank was fined an aggregate $630 million for their involvement in a $10 billion Russian money-laundering scheme -- and Deutsche Bank's records were later reportedly subpoenaed by special prosecutor Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections:[Trump] took out two mortgages against a resort in Miami and a $170 million loan to finish his hotel in Washington, D.C. According to Bloomberg, by the time Trump was elected president of the United States in November 2016, he owed Deutsche around $300 million, an unprecedented debt for an incoming president. (His June financial disclosure showed he owes the bank $130 million, which is due in full in 2024.)The loans to Trump weren't the only abnormal behavior at Deutsche. Around the same time he received his new line of credit, the bank was laundering money, according to the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS). Russian money. Billions of dollars that flowed from Moscow to London, then from London to New York -- part of a scheme for which European and American regulators eventually punished the bank.Was the timing of this illicit operation and the loans to Trump coincidental? Or evidence of something more sinister -- a critical chapter in the president's long history of suspicious business deals with Russian and post-Soviet oligarchs?:Little hard evidence suggests that the Kennedy rumors are more than political conspiracy-driven speculation, however.  Justin Kennedy left Deutsche Bank before the money laundering activity referenced above took place, and some sources have asserted that Justin Kennedy had little or no involvement with Trump's Deutsche Bank dealings:MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle, who worked for eight years at Deutsche Bank before joining the news network, cautioned about reaching conclusions because there are multiple parts of the bank that ""can easily get confused and lumped together.""""While I know and it has been well-reported, Deutsche was a massive lender to Mr. Trump, I want to put a new context,"" she said. ""A lot of this comes from multiple sides of the bank, specifically the private bank, and that was not where Mr. Kennedy worked.""Citing two former members of senior management, Ruhle said, ""a lot of the recent lending comes from the private bank ... most of which was done after Justin left the bank.""""The business Mr. Kennedy ran was part of a real estate team that did some business. It was not part of the private bank business,"" Ruhle continued. ""To say that he was the point guy that lent all of this money to Trump, I think, is short-sided. It's a lot more complicated."":The level of engagement Justin Kennedy might have had with Donald Trump's financial dealings at Deutsche Bank remains ambiguous for now, but the New York Times gave little weight to the notion that Anthony Kennedy was directly pressured into retiring, observing that it's not unusual for presidents to be mindful of when an open seat on the Supreme Court bench might be in the offing and strategize around the possibility:There were no direct efforts to pressure or lobby Justice Kennedy to announce his resignation, and it was hardly the first time a president had done his best to create a court opening. ""In the past half-century, presidents have repeatedly been dying to take advantage of timely vacancies,"" said Laura Kalman, a historian at the University of California, Santa Barbara.When Mr. Trump took office last year, he already had a Supreme Court vacancy to fill, the one created by the 2016 death of Justice Antonin Scalia. But Mr. Trump dearly wanted a second vacancy, one that could transform the court for a generation or more. So he used the first opening to help create the second one. He picked Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, who had served as a law clerk to Justice Kennedy, to fill Justice Scalia's seat.:And when Justice Gorsuch took the judicial oath in April 2017 at a Rose Garden ceremony, Justice Kennedy administered it -- after Mr. Trump first praised the older justice as ""a great man of outstanding accomplishment.""""Throughout his nearly 30 years on the Supreme Court,"" Mr. Trump said, ""Justice Kennedy has been praised by all for his dedicated and dignified service.""There is reason to think, then, that Mr. Trump's praise of Justice Kennedy was strategic.Then, after Justice Gorsuch's nomination was announced, a White House official singled out two candidates for the next Supreme Court vacancy: Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and Judge Raymond M. Kethledge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati.The two judges had something in common: They had both clerked for Justice Kennedy.Moreover, Politico reported back in April 2017 (before the Mueller investigation into Russian interference was even underway) that the Trump White House might have been utilizing connections between Trump's and Kennedy's children to ease the elder Kennedy into retirement.  Notably, Politico referenced Justin Kennedy's having a connection with Donald Trump, Jr., not President Trump himself, and made no mention of Deutsche Bank::While the White House is focused on shepherding Trump's first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, through the Senate confirmation process, the president and his team are obsessed with the next possible vacancy.The likeliest candidate is Kennedy, who has sat at the decisive fulcrum of the most important Supreme Court cases for more than a decade. Replacing him with a reliable conservative would tip the court to the right, even if no other seat comes open under Trump -- whose team has taken to exploring every imaginable line of communication to keep tabs on the justice and to make him comfortable as he ponders a potential retirement.One back channel is the fact that Kennedy's son, Justin, knows Donald Trump Jr. through New York real estate circles. Another is through Kennedy's other son, Gregory, and Trump's Silicon Valley adviser Peter Thiel. They went to Stanford Law School together and served as president of the Federalist Society in back-to-back years, according to school records. More recently, Kennedy's firm, Disruptive Technology Advisers, has worked with Thiel's company Palantir Technologies.The White House has also closely monitored retirement chatter by tapping into the network of former Kennedy clerks, a group that includes Gorsuch himself. Some in the legal world viewed Gorsuch's selection -- he would be the first Supreme Court clerk to serve alongside a former boss -- as an olive branch to Kennedy that, should he retire next, his seat would be in reliable presidential hands.:Those close to Trump's judicial-selection process stress that they're not pressuring Kennedy to hang up his robe, only seeking to put him at ease.It may be true, as outlined above, that members of the Trump administration undertook efforts to ""assure Kennedy that his judicial legacy would be in good hands should he step down at the end of the court's [current] term."" But no substantive evidence yet suggests anything more than that President Trump and other members of his administration might have sought to curry favor with a justice who was already mulling retirement to influence the timing of that event."

The main piece of ""evidence"" from this video is a clip from a season four episode of Arrested Development entitled ""The B. Team"" featuring actors Ron Howard and Jason Bateman.:Howard: Let's go inside the lem.Batemen: Wow is this the one that landing on the moon?Hward: On a sound stage.Bateman: Oh from Apollo 13?Howard: No from 1969. I'll tell you about it inside the lem. It's sound proof in there. And it's a national secret. So, NASA did go to the moon in 1971. That one was real. But in 69, they weren't ready. So they faked the whole thing on the sound stage of Gentle Ben.The narrator of the conspiracy theory acknowledges that the footage he is using comes from a scripted television show, but adds that Ron Howard is purposefully ""mixing truth with lies"" in order to convince the ""sheep"" that man has never been to the moon.The logic appears to go like this: Ron Howard lies about the 1971 moon landing being real in order to gain the interest of the ""sheep."" Once they are paying attention, he tells ""the truth"" about the 1969 moon landing (i.e. that it was a hoax). Why Ron Howard chose to insert this information into an episode of Arrested Development is not explained.:While moon landing conspiracy theorists have used a wide range of sources in an attempt to prove that the 1969 moon landing was a hoax, the choice to include Ron Howard is exceptionally odd due to the director's affinity for astronauts, NASA, and space travel. In addition to directing Apollo 13, Ron Howard was also involved with a documentary about the Apollo missions called ""In the Shadow of the Moon.""  That documentary ended with several Apollo of astronauts addressing claims that the moon landings were faked:Charlie Duke: ""We've been to the moon nine times. If we faked it, why did we fake it nine times?""Mike Collins: ""I don't know two Americans who could have a fantastic secret without one of them blurting it out to the press. Can you imagine thousands of people being able to keep this secret?"":Previously, conspiracy theorists uncovered ""long-lost evidence"" of Stanley Kubrick admitting that he had helped fake the moon landings (which later turned out, unsurprisingly, to be a hoax).

For example, the right-wing Pacific Pundit website wrote:Martha G. Kavanaugh, the mother of Brett Kavanaugh was a Maryland district judge in 1996. In an amazing coincidence, Martha Kavanaugh was the judge in a foreclosure case in which Christine Blasey-Ford's parents were the defendants. Now it all becomes clear. Blasey-Ford is going after Brett Kavanaugh, not because of what he did in high school. Instead, Christine Blasey-Ford is going after Brett Kavanaugh out of spite and revenge for a case rulled [sic] on by Brett Kavanaugh [sic] mother. Martha Kavanaugh, Brett's mother was Montgomery County Circuit Court judge from 1993 until she retired in 2001. During a 1996 foreclosure case, Martha Kavanaugh ruled against the parents of Christine Blasey-Ford in a foreclosure case...Isn't it kind of amazing that all the media reports today didn't mention this little conflict of interest for Blasey-Ford?In a similar vein, the right-wing Powerline web site wrote::It looks like Brett Kavanaugh's mother, Judge Martha Kavanaugh, ruled against the parents of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accuses Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault. Court documents show the losing party in a foreclosure case Martha Kavanaugh heard to be Ralph and Paula Blasey of Potomac, Maryland. They appear to be Christine Blasey Ford's parents.The fact that Kavanaugh's mother ruled against Ford's parents doesn't prove Ford is lying about the conduct of the son. Her allegation, coming so many years after the fact and without a description of when or where the event supposedly occurred, is probably not susceptible to being ruled out conclusively. But there now seems to be a motive, beyond partisan politics, for Ford to make up or significantly embellish her story so long after the ""fact.""These accounts got only the background facts right while wildly misrepresenting the key details and amounting to a gross misrepresentation of what actually took place.Martha Kavanaugh did preside for certain parts of a 1996 foreclosure case involving Ralph and Paula Blasey, who are indeed Christine Blasey Ford's parents. However, Kavanaugh actually ruled favorably toward the Blaseys, who ended up keeping their home. These two facts cause the logic of the conspiracy theory, such as it ever was, to collapse.:BackgroundMaryland state land records show that Ralph and Paula Blasey purchased a house in Potomac, Maryland, in June 1977. According to Montgomery County Circuit Court records, in August 1996 a company called UMLIC-Eight Corporation initiated foreclosure proceedings against the couple.However, by December of that year the Blaseys were able to refinance the mortgage, and in January 1997 UMLIC filed a motion to dismiss their earlier petition. Judge Martha Kavanaugh granted that motion on 4 February 1997, thus formally bringing an end to the foreclosure proceedings against the Blaseys.The claim that Kavanaugh ""ruled against"" Ralph and Paul Blasey, central to the conspiracy theory about their daughter's sexual assault allegations made 21 years later, is therefore false.The couple kept their house, ownership of which they transferred into a Blasey family trust in June 2014. This fact also undermines the putative logic of the claim that Christine Blasey Ford was motivated by vengeance against Martha Kavanaugh: not only did Judge Kavanaugh not ""rule against"" the Blaseys in 1996, but the outcome of the case in question was favorable to the family, who ended up keeping the house.:ConclusionNot only does the ""foreclosure"" claim constitute a failed, factually baseless attempt to impugn the motives of Christine Blasey Ford in giving up her anonymity to make sexual assault allegations against a would-be Supreme Court justice, but it offers a prime example of a common feature of many conspiracy theories: mistaking coincidental and tangential encounters for meaningful and substantial conflicts and connections."

One such example is a video of a bald U.S. Secret Service agent with strong bone structure who conspiracy theorists since 2013 have accused of being a reptilian shape shifter.:The video, as of this writing, is nearly a decade old. It stems from a speech given by former U.S. President Barack Obama in 2013 at a March 4, 2013, policy conference held by the lobbying group American Israel Public Affairs Committee, also known by its acronym AIPAC. In the video, conspiracy theorists zoom in on the Secret Service agent and accuse him of being a reptile, which could not have helped that individual's self-esteem.The conspiracy theory cropped up in December 2022 in a widely viewed Instagram video::""This was the day that the government was caught with a reptilian Secret Service agent in HD and they didn't deny anything,"" the video's host intones.But the video and underlying conspiracy theory -- that the U.S. government hid a reptilian man in plain sight but also tried to hide that it did so-- is of course contradictory and relies on a well-worn conspiracy theory about shape-shifting lizard people.It raises such obvious questions as: If the government was trying to hide its reptilian agents, why put one in a highly visible position at a televised event? If reptilians are capable of shape-shifting to look like humans, why not just shape-shift into something less obvious, like a table or chair? Do shape-shifting reptilians get full pay and benefits as government employees?Is It True the Government 'Didn't Deny' Its Reptilian Employee?:In the Instagram video, the host claims that the government ""didn't deny anything"" about the claim that a reptilian was guarding Obama during his 2013 AIPAC speech. This claim is based on a screenshot of a March 2013 story published by technology news site Wired. The story contains a tongue-in-cheek quote from Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the National Security Council, in which she refers to Obama-era budget cuts referred to as sequestration:I can't confirm the claims made in this video, but any alleged program to guard the president with aliens or robots would likely have to be scaled back or eliminated in the sequester, I'd refer you to the Secret Service or Area 51 for more details.In the context of the Wired story, that response was not so much a lack of denial as an unserious response to an unserious question. Wired was asking the White House about shape-shifting aliens guarding the president, after all. And the article concludes with this deadpan paragraph:But still: alien guards. They've gotten a raw deal through the sequester. The White House didn't clarify if its reptilian Secret Service agents are subject to the furloughs without pay affecting federal employees. But say this for the automatic budget cuts: They may have prevented Obama from falling into the clutches of an intergalactic conspiracy -- that is, if the president wasn't in on it from the start.:In other words, the White House's response can't be read as a refusal to deny, but instead seems to fit with the overall sardonic tone of the Wired piece. It was an attempt at humor over an outlandish claim that some have since taken seriously.Was the Video Taken Down in a Cover Up?The Instagram host claims that he ""literally looked for the video everywhere and couldn't find it, the only place it exists now is Reddit,"" referring to the popular message board-style social media platform.The video hasn't been taken down. It may no longer be available in old news stories about it, like the Wired story, perhaps because the story is now almost 10 years old and hasn't been updated. But the video is still available on YouTube, and also, clearly, Reddit, and on the Instagram post. If the government is trying to hide the video it is doing a very inadequate job.Is the Secret Service Agent a Reptilian?:The ""reptilian"" conspiracy theory has been floating around for years, with one of its more prominent promoters being David Icke. The conspiracy theory posits that a race of reptilians is secretly controlling the world, pulling the strings in major human atrocities like the Holocaust. Icke, who is English, has been barred from holding events in countries like the Netherlands and Germany over anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.There is no basis for this claim about the Secret Service agent, and he isn't a member of a reptilian race -- he simply appears to be tall and slender and with a strong facial bone structure. Although the Instagram video claimed he had ""green"" skin, there is no evidence that any such tint was present in real life, as opposed to an effect created by lighting, the camera, or even editing.Aside from the conspiracy theory about reptilian shape-shifters controlling the world, the idea of human-like creatures with reptile features is a common scientific trope. For example, the original ""Star Trek"" series featured a reptilian race called the Gorn.:"

In reality, she was born female and named Michelle LaVaughn Robinson. :These changes to Michelle Obama's face were likely made with Adobe Photoshop.The picture was posted on the Facebook account of Wanda Freeman Barzizza, the wife of a formal mayoral candidate for the city of Germantown, Tennessee. We previously reported several times about the fact that Barzizza has spent years sharing misleading information. The account had also received multiple month-long suspensions in the past, based on both the long gaps in time between posts and admissions made on her own public feed.The original, undoctored picture of the Obamas was apparently captured on Christmas Day in 1991, at least according to a Reddit post and the fact that a ring is not visible on future Mrs. Obama's hand. We found this information through the use of TinEye, a helpful reverse image search website.It's unclear where the doctored version of the Christmas photo originated. If we find this out, we'll update this story in the future.:"
557,557,110.DidaShadowyConspirac,"Claim:Authorities have deleted court records and online references to former United States Attorney Lisa Barsoomian, as part of a ""deep state"" conspiracy.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In 2017 and 2018, the FBI's investigation into possible electoral collusion between agents of the Russian state and members of Donald Trump's presidential campaign team prompted many conspiracy theories. Some of them were clearly designed to corrode and undermine the credibility of the investigation and the integrity of those perceived as being hostile or potentially damaging to President Trump, including former Federal Bureau of Investivation director James Comey, former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and those surrounding her, and several other Department of Justice officials, including Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. :One particular theory -- although it is more a cluster of speculation and innuendo than a coherent theory -- went one step further, targeting former Justice Department lawyer and attorney for the National Institutes for Health Lisa Barsoomian, who is also Rod Rosenstein's wife.Conspiracy theorists have been speculating and alleging that a shadowy ""deep state"" conspiracy has forced records of and references to Barsoomian (supposedly a secret Clinton loyalist) be ""purged"" from the Internet. In reality, there are ample references to Barsoomian throughout the internet, and her record as an attorney remains well documented in court records over the past two decades. Those alleging conspiracies and conflicts of interest in the fact that Barsoomian has acted as an attorney for former United States President Bill Clinton appear to understand little about the nature of a government attorney's work -- or else to be deliberately misrepresenting that reality. In March 2018, the conspiracy theorist web site Patriots4Truth.org wrote:Barsoomian...represented Bill Clinton in 1998...You may be saying to yourself, okay who cares, who cares about the work history of this Barsoomian woman? Apparently someone does BECAUSE :  Someone out there cares so much that they've ""purged"" all Barsoomian court documents for her Clinton representation in Hamburg vs. Clinton in 1998 and its appeal in 1999 from the DC District and Appeals court dockets (?) Someone out there cares so much that the internet has been ""purged"" of all information pertaining to Barsoomian. Historically this indicates that the individual is a protected CIA operative.:Nobody has ""purged all Barsoomian court documents"" relating to her role in the 1998 case Hamburg vs. Clinton. This is false. It took us only a few minutes to find that case on a court records database and locate a document written and signed by Barsoomian. In 1998, a Wyoming military veteran named Al Hamburg -- an eccentric ""perennial candidate"" and letter-writer who once attempted to register his dog as a presidential candidate -- filed a civil rights case against Clinton in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief.  Hamburg alleged anti-white discrimination by Clinton and claimed that the president was part of a conspiracy to bring about an ""alien invasion"" by Mexican-American military members. He demanded an upgrade to his Vietnam-era ""undesirable discharge"" from the Army, along with three months' pay allegedly due to him since 1967, and ""at least ten thousand dollars.""Clinton's response to Hamburg's claims is signed by several Justice department officials -- including Barsoomian, who was acting in her capacity as an Assistant U.S. Attorney. The case was quickly dismissed by a judge. :Far from being the smoking gun in an elaborate, decades-long conspiracy, Barsoomian's role in the case singled out by the conspiracy theorists was utterly mundane, routine, and entirely in keeping with the ordinary course of her job as an attorney in the Department of Justice. The spurious, factually inaccurate claim appears to have originated in a June 2017 blog post written by the controversial conservative political consultant Roger Stone, who was briefly Trump's campaign manager in 2015. On his web site, Stone wrote:Lisa Barsoomian works for R. Craig Lawrence, an attorney who has represented Robert Mueller three times, James Comey five times, Barack Obama forty-five times, Kathleen Sebellius fifty-six times, Bill Clinton forty times, and Hillary Clinton seventeen times between 1991 and 2017.Barsoomian participated in some of this work personally and has herself represented the FBI at least five separate times.  It would be great to research the specifics of the cases she worked in, many of the documents from the Court Docket relating to these cases have been removed from the D.C. District and Appeals Court, including her representation for Clinton in 1998's case Hamburg. V. Clinton.:What is especially notable about this particular line of argument is its insidious misrepresentation of the work of a government attorney. Neither Barsoomian nor Lawrence were acting as attorneys in private practice, and neither represented Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, anyone else in a personal capacity. As United States attorneys, it would at times have been part of their job to act in court on behalf of the President of the United States and other government officials, departments and agencies. Naturally, this also extends to Republican politicians, appointees and Republican-run agencies and departments, something that Stone and other conspiracy theorists fail to mention. As part of their Justice Department duties, Barsoomian and Lawrence also defended -- among others -- Colin Powell, John Ashcroft, and Tom Ridge, all Republicans appointed by former President George W. Bush.  :"

The law just doesn't work that way.:First off, the ""problem"" this ineffective solution supposedly addresses is a non-existent one: Facebook isn't claiming copyright to the personal information, photographs, and other material that their users are posting to the social network, nor have they announced any plans that would make all Facebook posts public (even previously deleted ones) regardless of a user's privacy settings):In response to rumors about copyright issues that began circulating in November 2012 after Facebook announced they were considering revoking users' rights to vote on proposed policy changes, the company issued a statement noting that:There is a rumor circulating that Facebook is making a change related to ownership of users' information or the content they post to the site. This is false. Anyone who uses Facebook owns and controls the content and information they post, as stated in our terms. They control how that content and information is shared. That is our policy, and it always has been. Click here to learn more: www.facebook.com/policies.Similarly, ABC News reported::[Users worried that] Facebook will own their photos or other media are posting [a frightful message] -- unaware that it is a hoax. Here's the truth: Facebook doesn't own your media.""We have noticed some statements that suggest otherwise and we wanted to take a moment to remind you of the facts -- when you post things like photos to Facebook, we do not own them,"" Facebook spokesman Andrew Noyes said in a statement. ""Under our terms you grant Facebook permission to use, distribute, and share the things you post, subject to the terms and applicable privacy settings.""Brad Shear, a Washington-area attorney and blogger who is an expert on social media, said the message [that Facebook users are posting to their walls is] ""misleading and not true."" He said that when you agree to Facebook's terms of use you provide Facebook a ""non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any content you post. You do not need to make any declarations about copyright issues since the law already protects you. The privacy declaration [in this message] is worthless and does not mean anything.""In any case, Facebook users cannot retroactively negate any of the privacy or copyright terms they agreed to when they signed up for their accounts, nor can they unilaterally alter or contradict any new privacy or copyright terms instituted by Facebook, simply by posting a contrary legal notice on their Facebook walls. Moreover, the fact that Facebook is now a publicly traded company (i.e., a company that has issued stocks which are traded on the open market) or an ""open capital entity"" has nothing to do with copyright protection or privacy rights. Any copyright or privacy agreements users of Facebook have entered into with that company prior to its becoming a publicly traded company or changing its policies remain in effect: they are neither diminished nor enhanced by Facebook's public status.:Before you can use Facebook, you must indicate your acceptance of that social network's legal terms, which includes its privacy policy and its terms and policies. You can neither alter your acceptance of that agreement nor restrict the rights of entities who are not parties to that agreement simply by posting a notice to your Facebook account, citing the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), or referencing the Berne Convention. (One of the common legal talismans referenced above is UCC Section 1-308, which has long been popular among conspiracy buffs who incorrectly maintain that citing it above your signature on an instrument will confer upon you the ability to invoke extraordinary legal rights.)If you do not agree with Facebook's stated policies, you have several options:Decline to sign up for a Facebook account.Bilaterally negotiate a modified policy with Facebook.Lobby for Facebook to amend its policies through its Facebook Site Governance section.Cancel your Facebook account.:(Note that in the last case, you may have already ceded some rights which you cannot necessarily reclaim by canceling your account.)As techtalk noted of Facebook users' current privacy rights:The fact is that Facebook members own the intellectual property (IP) that is uploaded to the social network, but depending on their privacy and applications settings, users grant the social network ""a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Facebook (IP License).""Facebook adds, ""[t]his IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.""While the social network does not technically own its members content, it has the right to use anything that is not protected with Facebook's privacy and applications settings. For instance, photos, videos and status updates set to public are fair game.:Similar memesA variation on this meme related to Snapchat photos, which was similarly false, went viral in summer 2019. A fresh variant alleging that a ""new Facebook/Meta rule"" allows the company to use members' photos without permission went viral in fall 2021."
560,560,583.MondexBiochips,"Claim:   Mondex is planning to replace money with biochips embedded in people's heads and hands. Status:   False.Origins:   March 2004 saw the latest iteration of a form of conspiracy theory that attempts to tie automated systems related to financial transactions to the ""mark of the beast"" prophesied in Chapter 13 of the New Testament's book of Revelation:[The beast] causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads.And that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666.In earlier days conspiratorial rumors linked this bit of scripture to the advent of  bar codes on product packaging; now a much-circulated 18-slide PowerPoint presentation earnestly tries to associate it with Mondex, a brand of ""smart card"" technology, by misleadingly equating smart cards with implantable identification technology.:Our conspiracy train has already jumped the track by the third slide, which conflates two distinctly different types of technology.The device pictured above is a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip (also known as an ""ID chip""), used (among other purposes) to assist retailers with Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC).  Described as ""bar codes on steroids,"" tiny RFID chips can be embedded in products (or their packaging); when triggered by sensors, these chips emit short bursts of identifying data streamed via radio waves (or ""RF"").  This system offers a significant improvement over the current bar coding system for a number of reasons, including:  RFID chips can store much more information than bar codes.  RFID chips are a read/write technology, so more information can be added to them as needed.  RFID chips don't require line-of-sight proximity (i.e., the information they store can be read even when products are still encased in boxes or crates).  RFID technology can be used to scan items in groups rather than one-at-a-time.  (For example, a grocery store checker could scan an entire shopping cart full of items all at once rather than having to run each item past a scanner individually.) RFID chips can enable the tracking of individual pieces of merchandise. (That is, a retailer could track not only that his store sold six cans of XYZ brand beans on Wednesday, he could track exactly which six cans were sold that day, information that might prove helpful if a recall order were issued for cans originating from a particular lot.) RFID chips are more robust (i.e., not subject to problems caused by tearing, creasing, or alteration) than bar coding.:Other uses for RFID chips have included implanting them in pets to help identify the owners should the animals become lost (a collar and tag can too easily come loose or be removed), or implanting them in humans to encode vital information that emergency medical personnel might need to know when treating a patient who is unconscious or unable to speak.(Technically, a biochip is a computer chip made from organic molecules rather than from silicon or germanium.  The term ""biochip"" is also used more generally to refer to any type of chip implanted in living beings, but RFID is only one of many technologies that might be used in such a chip. Kevin Warwick, a Professor of Cybernetics at Reading University, made news in 2000 when he had a silicon chip transponder surgically implanted in his arm.)The concept described in the text accompanying this photo, however, describes a different type of technology: the smart card.:Almost every credit card issued nowadays includes a magnetic stripe which encodes information about the card that can be read when the card is swiped through an electronic card reader.  (In most cases the information encoded is merely a repetition of the account number and expiration date embossed on the card, allowing the card to be more easily read by electronic scanning devices.)  The smart card technology takes that concept further by replacing the magnetic stripe with a tiny microprocessor embedded in the card. The microprocessor can store information that might be used for a variety of purposes, such as identifying that the bearer of the card is its authorized user, providing basic personal data (e.g., name, address, phone number) to free consumers from the necessity of filling out repetitious forms, or providing important background information about a patient to medical personnel.  (Smart cards also have the advantage of being ""contact-less"" -- they can transmit data by RF instead of having to be physically swiped through readers.)Another envisioned use for smart cards is in electronic payment schemes.  Rather than carrying around currency and coins, consumers could use smart cards that would be able to tap into centralized systems which keep track of how much each person has available to spend.  The purchase price would be automatically deducted from the buyer's account at the point of sale, conceivably eliminating the need for money altogether someday.:Here the text goes even further astray in an erroneous attempt to tie smart card technology to specifics of the Biblical prophecy found in Revelation 13:16 and 13:17:[The beast] also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name.First of all, smart card technology involves microprocessors embedded in cards, not people.  Secondly, the uses of biochips in humans and other animals for identification purposes do not involve implanting such chips in the head or the hands.  The preferred location for such chips is an out-of-the-way fleshy area that will allow for tissue to bond the chip and lessen the possibility of any irritation or discomfort to the host, making the head and hands (too bony and exposed) non-ideal for such purposes.  The recommended implantation location for biochips is between the shoulderblades, towards the back of the upper arm (or on the back between the front legs of a dog or cat).:The statements included in the last slide above are all misleading or inaccurate: Motorola is one of the companies invested in producing smart card technology, but they're far from the only ones. Motorola also produces biochips, but associating that fact with Mondex is misleading. Mondex is a brand of smart card technology, not a type of biochip. A transponder is a radio or radar transmitter/receiver activated for transmission by the reception of a predetermined signal.  It isn't technically a ""system of storage,"" other than in the sense that the response transmitted upon reception of the predetermined signal is ""stored"" within the responding device. The RFID technology currently used in applications such as merchandise tracking or human/pet identification doesn't involve chips with stored batteries; it uses a passive system in which the power for transmitting the information stored within a chip is provided by the scanning device itself.:MasterCard did acquire a 51% stake in London-based Mondex International in 1996, and they have been trying to establish a variety of Mondex-based applications in a number of countries in recent years.  However, attempts to launch the use of Mondex smart cards as ""electronic purse"" alternatives to cash over the past decade have so far been disappointingly unsuccessful, as this October 2003 news account of a Mondex test launch in the UK illustrates:A number of electronic payment schemes have been launched in the past decade but many have languished because they have not found resonance with consumers. The Mondex card was launched in the UK in 1995 by a consortium of banks and BT, the telecommunications group. It looks like a credit card and contains a chip that can be ""loaded"" with cash from a bank account. It was seen as as ideal for small purchases such as newspapers and rounds of drinks in pubs. It was introduced in Swindon in 1994 and then on university campuses at Exeter, Edinburgh and Nottingham. But in spite of trials in about 20 countries, Mondex has hardly got beyond the test stage.:Again, Mondex is a smart card technology, not a biochip technology.  Mondex has nothing to do with implanting chips into people, nor are biochips inserted into heads or hands.  This bugaboo about heads and hands is just a silly attempt to tie this Mondex screed to the mention of ""foreheads"" and ""right hand"" found in the portion of Revelation 13 quoted above.Once again, Mondex is not a biochip technology -- it is a brand of smart card technology (which uses chips produced by other companies), and the Mondex card itself was introduced at least ten years ago.  Neither MasterCard nor Mondex has reported problems with smart card fraud or announced plans to insert smart card chips into human beings rather than place them within cards because otherwise the ""chip could be cut and the information would be changed or falsified.""  (Extracting an implanted chip from a human being isn't really prohibitively more difficult than removing one from a plastic card, certainly not enough to absolutely prevent dedicated criminals from pulling it off.):Now we've zoomed into the area of the nonsensical.  Even if we were to contemplate implanting the chips utilized in ""smart card"" technology into human beings, locating them in the head or the right hand wouldn't make them any more difficult or impossible to remove than locating them elsewhere in the body.  (Again, this is a rather silly attempt to tie ""Mondex"" to the prophecy of Revelation 13.)  Current RFID chip technology does not use lithium-based batteries, nor does it encompass tracking via a Global Positioning System (GPS).  (As the RFID FAQ notes,  in ""battery-less transponders, long read range and small size are mutually exclusive,"" and thus the read range of most RFID tracking chips is currently limited to less than three feet.)The name Mondex, of course, is derived from ""monde,"" the French word for ""world."":Well hey, there's nothing we take more ""serious"" than bad grammar or an exhortation to forward a nonsensical message to everyone we know.VeriChip is one of many companies that produces implantable identification technology, but they really have nothing to do with smart cards in general or the Mondex brand of smart card in particular (other than that they have overlapping areas of interest in systems for personal identification and guaranteeing the integrity of financial transactions).Additional information:         RFID FAQ    (Association for Automatic Identification and Mobility)Last updated:   29 August 2007 :   Sources:     Booth-Thomas, Cathy.

561,561,596.IsItTrueThatEveryVot,"Claim:In U.S. elections, every vote was counted on election night until a few years ago.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On Nov. 1, 2022, the @catturd2 Twitter account, described by The Daily Beast as a ""MAGA troll account,"" tweeted to its nearly 1 million followers, ""Funny how we could easily count every vote in every state on election night until a few years ago."" Similarly, Arizona Republican Rep. Paul Gosar claimed, hours before Election Day, that ""one day is all it took until very recently"" to ""count all legal votes in an election."":However, this assertion about past U.S. elections is false.On Nov. 7, The Associated Press reported that ""no state releases complete and final results on election night"" and that they haven't done so in modern history, according to experts.The tweet appeared to be pushing the notion that it now takes much longer to count the votes on and after Election Day to bolster the broader (and false) conspiracy theory, pushed by former U.S. President Donald Trump and others, alleging there has been widespread voter fraud in U.S. elections in recent years. The implication appears to be that the ""delay"" is caused by some sort of tampering on a massive scale in the days after an election. But researchers have never found any credible evidence of large-scale voting fraud in American elections.:Before We BeginWe're going to dive into reporting on past elections and show examples of how it wasn't true that every vote was counted by election night. Bear in mind that there are multiple examples like the following from each election year and that the certified, or final, vote count always occurs later. For the purpose of keeping this story brief, we have documented only a few of the examples from each past election year.Also, we want to note off the top that some states begin counting mail-in and absentee ballots early, whereas others wait to start tabulating votes until Election Day. Readers can find data on these states and their vote-counting procedures on the website for the National Conference of State Legislatures.2020On Nov. 1, 2020, The Arizona Republic newspaper reported of that year's U.S. presidential election, ""Actual vote counts take weeks to tabulate."" The reporting also noted that, ""It's possible we won't know the winners of major races for more than a week."":According to newspaper archives on Newspapers.com, votes were still being counted after Election Day in California, Delaware, and Florida, to name just the first three examples we found.2018On Nov. 6, 2018, KQED.org reported of Election Day, ""For close races -- for example, some of the hotly contested congressional contests -- the final results may not be known for days, or possibly even weeks."" The story added, ""What will be needed tonight is generally in short supply these days: patience.""We were able to quickly find newspaper articles published after election night that said votes for the midterms were still in the process of being counted in New Jersey, Florida, and California, and again, those were simply the first three examples we encountered in search results.2016:On Nov. 7, 2016, Utah's Deseret News newspaper published a story with the headline, ""Here's why precinct results don't tell the whole story on election night."" The reporting said, ""Don't be shocked if you don't know whether or not your county voted for a certain candidate. The majority of Utah's votes are now mail-in votes, which delay the count.""After Election Day, votes were still being counted days later in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Arizona, and other states.2014On Nov. 5, 2014, the Burlington Free Press newspaper reported that Vermont's Democratic and Republican gubernatorial candidates in the 2014 election had chosen to wait until the morning after election night to make statements, so that all votes would have a chance to be counted.Further, we quickly found examples that showed votes were still being counted after Election Day in Illinois, California, Alaska, Virginia, Louisiana, and other states.:2012On Oct. 30, 2012, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser newspaper reported via USA Today that U.S. President Barack Obama and Republican rival Mitt Romney were ""prepared to take their presidential campaign to the courts,"" in the case that ""election night doesn't produce a clear winner."" Election Day was on Nov. 6 in 2012. The story documented how some states might take days to count all of the votes. ""In Ohio, for example, provisional and absentee ballots can be counted as late as Nov. 16,"" the reporting said.After Election Day, multiple newspapers reported that Florida, Montana, and Maryland were still counting votes, and once again, those were just the first three examples we found when performing a quick and simple online search.2010In 2010, The New York Times reported that ballots in the state of Washington were still being counted as of Nov. 3, the day after the election. Similarly, the Naples Daily News published that votes were still being counted in Florida after Election Day. More examples were easily located on Newspapers.com, such as votes still being counted after Election Day in Minnesota, Illinois, and California, just to name a few.:2008In 2008, a presidential election year, Election Day was on Nov. 4. On the next day, The Guardian, Politico, and many others reported that ballots were still being counted in some states. We quickly found newspaper articles that were published after the election that said it took days or even more than a week to count all of the votes in Massachusetts, Georgia, and Oregon, for example.2006On Nov. 9, 2006, two days after the 2006 election, the Billings Gazette newspaper reported that votes were still being counted in Montana. We also found that votes were still being counted in North Carolina as of Nov. 12, according to the Charlotte Observer.2004:On Nov. 3, 2004, the Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper reported that votes were still being counted in a number of states for the U.S. presidential election. The same was also the case in Iowa, the Miami Herald published. These were just the two first examples we found. Election Day was on Nov. 2.2002In the 2002 election, the The Monitor newspaper in McAllen, Texas, reported that votes were still being counted two days after Election Day. The same was the case days later in California, North Carolina, and Arizona, just to name a few examples we found.2000In the 2000 election, the winner of the presidential contest was not known for more than one month. As PBS.org reported, ""A few hundred votes separated Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore in Florida,"" which led to a recount and the famous term, ""hanging chads."":The story from PBS, which was originally published by The Associated Press, also noted that Election Day ended without a clear winner in the presidential contests of 1876, 1824, and 1800.The data in this story goes back more than two decades, with PBS and AP adding context for elections from the 19th century. With all of this information in mind, it seems clear that some people could use a subscription to Newspapers.com."
562,562,487.DidObamaOfficialsPre,"Claim:Officials under former U.S. President Barack Obama pressured NBC to remove Jay Leno from his position as host of ""The Tonight Show"" because of his jokes criticizing Obama.Why no rating on this article? This is a trending topic but has not yet been rated by Snopes for reasons we'll outline below.For years, numerous Snopes readers have called our attention to a viral rumor alleging that NBC executives fired Jay Leno from his position as host of ""The Tonight Show"" at the request of former U.S. President Barack Obama.Some readers' inquiries cited passages of the below-displayed Facebook post, which claimed unidentified officials working on behalf of Obama had successfully pressured the American media network into replacing the late-night talk show host because of the nature of his comedy.:Specifically, under the post's pretenses, the former president was supposedly upset by Leno's jokes about him.""[The] Obama White House had been leaning on, pressuring executives at NBC for the last two years to replace Jay Leno because the comedian was criticizing Obama every night,"" the post read. ""Obama didn't like it and considered it a racist attack on him."":The post went on to make several more claims about Obama's presidency and Leno's weeknight audience ratings, and also repeated purported quotes by the comedian about the former president.For the purpose of this fact check, however, we focused on the underlying assertion: that White House officials had once pressured NBC to remove Leno from the late-night show -- giving comedian Jimmy Fallon the spot -- because of Leno's criticism of Obama.While we were unable to uncover verifiable evidence to explicitly debunk that claim, the rumor has the below-listed traits that are often indicative of false claims:Only one political faction was circulating the rumor.The post did not include, nor link to, supporting material to substantiate its assertions -- and, based on our research, no such proof existed.If true, such a scheme by a presidential administration to coerce a major television network would have undeniably spurred investigations and coverage by reputable news outlets. That was not the case.The claim is attributed to anonymous ""Hollywood executives"" with supposedly secret information rather than an official or named source.The claim offers only one explanation for Leno's departure when other, less politically motivated explanations are plausible.:'The Johnny Carson Model'Firstly, it was true that Leno's opening monologues often included attacks on Obama, much like he wrote material criticizing former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush when they were in the White House.It was also factual that Leno interrogated Obama on serious matters when the former commander-in-chief appeared on the show as a guest. (Obama was the first sitting president to appear on the program, news archives showed.)Leno said he purposefully wrote material ""to appeal to everybody""; to play the audience ""like an orchestra,"" according to an interview with NPR.""You're trying to appeal to the whole spectrum,"" Leno said in another conversation with Steve Kroft of ""60 Minutes.""  ""That's the trick, you try to have something for everybody."":Ultimately, that joke-writing technique confused pundits on both sides of the political aisle during his time in the spotlight. The Atlantic once described Leno as ""something of an enigma when it comes to politics,"" while a USA Today columnist years later described him as ""an admitted social liberal/fiscal conservative.""Years later, after voters elected Donald Trump to the Oval Office, Leno said expectations were different for his successors. He said on NBC's ""Today"" show in spring 2019:Everyone has to know your politics. I kind of used Johnny [Carson's] model. People couldn't figure out. 'Well, you and your Republican friends' or 'Well, Mr. Leno, you and your Democratic buddies.' And I would get hate mail from both sides equally. And I thought, 'Well, that's fabulous. That's exactly what I want.'Obama to Leno: 'I'm Not Upset':POLITICO documented some of Leno's specific comments about Obama on the show, including a reference to the repeatedly debunked conspiracy theory that Obama wasn't born in America, but rather in Kenya. (""These White House scandals are not going away anytime soon,"" Leno said on the show. ""People in Kenya are now saying he's 100% American. That's how bad it's gotten."")In the end, however, Obama made it seem as if he was unaffected by Leno's campaigns against him and played along. On Leno's final show, which aired on Feb. 6, 2014, the former president appeared in a ""farewell"" video message alongside other celebrities and media personalities, and Obama said:""Jay, you've made a whole lot of jokes about me over the years, but do not worry: I'm not upset,"" Obama deadpanned, as described by POLITICO. ""On a totally unrelated note, I've decided to make you my new ambassador to Antarctica. Hope you got a warm coat, funny man.""Around the time of that video message, Obama spokesman Jay Carney told The Associated Press that Obama was indeed a Leno fan and enjoyed being a guest on his show.:That statement -- as well as Obama's appearance on Leno's final show in which he explicitly said ""I'm not upset"" -- undermined the basis of the viral rumor: that Obama did not like Leno's jokes and, because of that, took steps to remove the comedian from his platform.We reached out to the White House, as well as the Office of Barack and Michelle Obama, to ask if there was any truth to the claim that federal officials pressured NBC executives to replace Leno, and, if so, why. Snopes did not receive responses from either agency, but we will update this analysis if they get back to us.But Why Did Leno Leave 'The Tonight Show'?There was no proof to substantiate the claim that one or more people ""harrassed"" the network -- much less federal officials working on behalf of Obama -- about the nature of Leno's material and that those alleged interactions led to his departure. :Rather, more likely than not, the programming switch appeared to be a result of the network's explicitly stated goal to try to keep ratings high and grow an audience -- a conclusion we made based on public statements by Leno and NBC executives, as well as news archives.Leno hosted the 11:30 p.m. (ET) weeknight show for 22 years, beginning in 1992 when he took over for comedian Johnny Carson. There was a brief period in 2009 when ""Late Night"" host Conan O'Brien replaced him -- a change NBC negotiated years prior to try to appease Conan but, after plummeting ratings, walked back. The saga became known as the ""Late Night Wars"" or ""2010 Tonight Show conflict,"" inspiring on-air riffs and swipes at NBC executives from both O'Brien and Leno.But in spring 2013, NBC notified fans of what would become a permanent change -- that Leno, whose contract was set to expire the following year, would pass the torch to Fallon, who would leave behind NBC's ""Late Night with Jimmy Fallon"" that had been airing every weeknight after Leno. (Seth Meyers eventually took that spot.):According to NBC executives' statements to journalists at the time, the network wanted to trade hosts when the show's ratings were good (in March 2013, for example, the show hit a seven-week high in total viewers, with 3.52 million watching, CNN reported) and it started covering the 2014 Winter Olympics.""Jimmy Fallon is a unique talent and this is his time,"" NBC head Steve Burke told reporters at the time.Also, the network timed Fallon's premiere to coincide with other big adjustments; NBC executives had recruited Veteran ""Saturday Night Live"" producer Lorne Michaels to serve as the show's executive producer and relocated the show's headquarters from Burbank, California, to New York City.:History appeared to be repeating itself. Decades earlier, when Leno took over from Carson, the network used a similar strategy -- it waited until ratings peaked to make the hosting switch, BBC reported.However, unlike Leno, Carson voluntarily retired from the gig. USA Today reported:Leno would have remained at Tonight as long as NBC would have him. Leno's current contract expires in September 2014, but the network smoothed the way for the transition, got Leno on board, and the [Fallon and Leno] even teamed up for a jokey video that aired Monday night, suggesting there were no hard feelings.Here's a preview of that April 1, 2013, skit, confirming rumors of the transition:: As you can see, there appeared to be no bad blood between the two comedians. Fallon and Leno regularly did bits about the adjustment, and news stories cited a statement in which Leno, 62 at the time, explicitly congratulated his 38-year-old successor.""I hope you're as lucky as me and hold on to the job until you're the old guy,"" Leno said.In multiple public statements since then, Leno expressed acceptance of NBC executives' decision and framed it as a result of the entertainment industry's evolving demands -- nothing else. That evidence, again, discredited the theory that he was forced out because of his past comments about Obama.For example, during his ""60 Minutes"" interview with Steve Kroft in early 2014, Leno said the following:Kroft: You would have liked to have stayed?Leno: It's not my decision. And I think I probably would have stayed if we didn't have -- an extremely qualified, young guy ready to jump in. Sure, I probably would've stayed a little longer. But we have somebody very good, very talented. [...]If they said, 'Look, you're fired. We don't know who we're gonna get. We don't know what we're gonna put in there. But anybody but you, we just want you out of--' I would be hurt and offended. But this makes perfect sense to me. I understand this.: Around that same time, Ellen DeGeneres interviewed Leno on her show, where he said: ""Last time [with O'Brien], I was told. This time [with Fallon], I was asked.""In other words, he said he was asked to give up the mic; he accepted that request, and he understood why NBC executives chose Fallon to replace him. Leno himself described his successor as an ""extremely qualified, young guy,"" whose performance style made sense for the new time.:Years later, while promoting what could be his retirement gig -- a CNBC show called ""Jay Leno's Garage"" -- he said in the NPR interview that he believed the network had traded him for Fallon for no other reason than than their bottom lines.To conclude our reporting, we reached out to NBC, as well as the CNBC show, to elaborate on why the network gave Leno the boot; to explain if, or to what extent, the content of Leno's performances were the reason for his departure, and to confirm or deny the rumor about Obama officials. As of this writing, we have not received responses.In sum, the viral Facebook post exhibited the hallmarks of a baseless conspiracy theory. But until we hear back from representatives for Obama, NBC, or Leno to explicitly debunk its assertions, we cannot authoritatively rate this claim with a traditional Snopes rating.If we receive more information, we will update this post.:Have more information on this topic? Send us a tip."
563,563,238.DidPresidentTrumpSay,"Claim:President Trump has called for the death penalty for pedophiles.Rating:MixtureAbout this rating On 16 March 2017, the junk news web site social-consciousness.com published an article headlined ""Donald Trump Says Pedophiles Will Get the Death Penalty"" that opened as follows:Donald Trump has vowed to tackle the child abduction crisis in the United States by giving pedophiles a fast trial resulting in the death penalty. In October of 2012, Donald Trump tweeted that there are ""too many incidents"" and something ""must be done about these perverts.""With the Pizzagate scandal going on right now and Elite pedophilia running rampant, could this be what Trump was referring to when he talked about ""draining the swamp"", and how far up the social ladder will he be prepared to go when it comes to swiftly executing these offenders?According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, nearly 800,000 children are reported missing each year. That is more than 2,000 children abducted every single day. One every 40 seconds.However, it seems that those days are coming to an end. Recently, hundreds of people have been arrested in nationwide ""pizzagate"" raids. A huge nationwide sting has seen over 500 people connected to child sex offenses arrested in the first of many raids.:Although the article was written to give readers the impression that President Trump had recently announced his intention to implement a policy of summary executions for pedophiles, it was based entirely on a single tweet posted by citizen Donald Trump more than four years before he came President of the United States: Got to do something about these missing chidlren grabbed by the perverts. Too many incidents--fast trial, death penalty.-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2012Trump didn't explain at the time what prompted his tweet, nor has he suggested executing ""perverts"" or ""pedophiles"" since then, according to an archive of his tweets.  Moreover, his statement seemed to be aimed not at ""pedophiles"" in general, but specifically at those who abduct children for sexual exploitation.  Stories about shady rings of ""elite"" child predators are popular fodder for conspiracy theorists, and social-consciousness.com has reported that the false Pizzagate conspiracy theory is ""going on right now,"" along with other fabricated clickbait stories bearing headlines such as ""Brad Pitt Reveals: Elite Hollywood Pedophiles Control America"" and ""Vladimir Putin Reveals: The West Is Controlled by Satanic Pedophiles."":"
564,564,97.SutherlandSpringsSho,"Claim:We investigated a number of hoaxes, rumors, and conspiracy theories associated with a mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas on 5 November 2017.Rating:MixtureAbout this rating On 5 November 2017, a shooter opened fire on congregants at Sutherland Springs First Baptist Church, killing 26 people and wounding scores more.The shooting remains under investigation, with few solid facts about the incident confirmed by law enforcement. In the absence of verified updates, common conspiracy tropes, claims, conjecture, and rumors filled the information void on social media.:Here are some that we have encountered:Was the shooter linked to an ""antifa civil war""?The shooting in Sutherland Springs was predated by two extremely popular falsehoods -- ""antifa,"" a shorthand term for anti-fascist groups, planned a 4 November 2017 civil war or coup, and that a coincidental Department of Defense drill provided cover for a ""false flag"" attack during the purported government overthrow.We rated both claims independently false; ""antifa"" neither overthrew the government nor attempted to as of 7 November 2017. Further, no electromagnetic pulse-related blackout occurred during that time.Naturally, the same sites claiming there would be a 4 November 2017 government coup spread stories in the immediate aftermath ""linking"" the Sutherland Springs First Baptist Church shooting to an ""antifa civil war."" That claim is false.:Was the shooter's name Chris Ward?Immediately after the shooting and prior to law enforcement verification, rumors circulated claiming that the shooter's name was Chris Ward. However, it was established fairly rapidly that Ward was a victim, not the perpetrator:Internet rumors wrongly named Chris Ward as the church gunman; his wife and three children were shot, family friend Gracie Crews tells me.-- Matt Pearce ? (@mattdpearce) November 5, 2017Was the shooter a ""Muslim convert"" named ""Samir Al-Hajeed"" or a man named ""Sam Hyde""?Neither. On 5 November 2017, the completely unreliable site Freedom Daily published an article (""BREAKING: America's Worst Nightmare About Texas Church Shooter Just Confirmed - Here's Who He Is"" with a web address that ended: ""breaking-the-texas-church-shooter-is-a-muslim-this-is-terrorism"")::... While this seems like a random attack from a psychotic white guy who the left will use as a poster child for more gun control, his reasoning for arming up and taking over a building full of Christians was because of is religion. ""The shooter is dead. He has not been officially identified, but Mustachio Tweeted: '#texaschurchshooting shooter is 29-year-old US marine turned Muslim convert, Samir Al-Hajeed. His manifesto is making its rounds on the web,'"" the Santa Monica Observer reported.That rumor is clearly false, as ""Samir Al-Hajeed"" was also blamed for the Las Vegas shooting (with an identical photograph). The hoax was recycled in the hours after the tragedy in Sutherland Springs. Although the claim was debunked almost instantly, Freedom Daily's uncorrected page remained live and in circulation as of 6 November 2017.The Samir Al-Hajeed/Sam Hyde hoax appears as a joke after almost every mass shooting. Read more about it here.Did an armed civilian help put an end to the shooting in Sutherland Springs?:Another popular claim is that an armed civilian intervened in the immediate aftermath, helping to bring an end to the massacre:An armed civilian helped stop the shooter yesterday. So if you've argued for this, I guess you look at 26 dead and think ""My idea works.""-- Mark Harris (@MarkHarrisNYC) November 6, 2017This is mostly true. Two civilians, Stephen Willeford and Johnnie Langedorff, confronted and chased the shooter: On 5 November 2017, 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley killed more than two dozen people -- including an 18-month-old infant -- when he opened fire inside First Baptist Church at about 11:20 A.M. with what authorities said was an ""assault-type"" rifle. He fled the scene in an SUV -- but not before neighbor Stephen Willeford, 55, burst from his home barefoot carrying an AR-15 and reportedly exchanged gunfire with him. Willeford then ran over to Johnnie Langedorff, 27, a passing truck driver who witnessed the gunfire exchange, and told him the man had just shot churchgoers and needed to be stopped. With that, they were off.:The two chased Kelley, exchanging gunfire with him and staying on the phone with law enforcement until he ""wrecked out"" and then died of what is thought to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.Was the shooter an atheist on the Democratic National Committee's payroll?False. A fake news site's claim the shooter was DNC operative and atheist was marked with a clear ""satire"" disclaimer. We will update this page as more hoaxes and rumors appear."
565,565,341.ClintonResearcherVic,"Much of the Internet was abuzz in early August 2016 over a report that Victor Thorn, a ""prominent Clinton researcher,"" had committed suicide, as reported on the American Free Press web site:Prolific author, AMERICAN FREE PRESS writer and seasoned Clinton researcher Victor Thorn was found at the top of a mountain near his home, the apparent victim of a gunshot wound. Family and some close friends contend Thorn took his own life on his birthday, August 1. Thorn would have been 54.At the peak of his writing career, the author of some 20 books and 30 chapbooks, Thorn had reported for this newspaper for over a decade, writing thousands of articles on myriad subjects from conspiracy to health-related topics. Best known for his investigate research on the Clintons, Thorn wrote the Clinton trilogy--three definitive works that delved into the history of the power couple including their sordid scandals, Bill Clinton's sexual assaults of multiple women, and the drug running out of Mena, Arkansas while Clinton was governor of the state.Thorn wrote for the American Free Press and was the author of books on the Clintons, including the trilogy Hillary (And Bill): The Sex Volume,  Hillary (And Bill): The Drugs Volume, and Hillary (And Bill): The Murder Volume, as well as Crowning Clinton: Why Hillary Shouldn't Be in the White House.  :Thorn also penned volumes about the ""entire holohoax industry,"" such as The Holocaust Hoax Exposed (""Debunking the 20th Century's Greatest Fabrication"") and works such as 9-11 EVIL: Israel's Central Role in the September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks (""the book the ADL and the Jewish Lobby don't want you to read"") and Made in Israel (revealing that ""the actual plotters [of 9/11 were] Talmudic exterminators and their neo-con political sycophants"").  In addition, he authored New World Order Assassins (""reaching conclusions that far transcend even those compiled by other conspiracy researchers"").Thorn's work for the American Free Press is perhaps not so widely known because that newspaper was classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.Online conspiracy theories about the death of the conspiracy writer have questioned ""suicide"" reports and attributed Thorn's death to causes such as ""Clinton hit squads"" and ""Zionist attacks"": :"
566,566,206.FacebookShuttersProT,"Snopes may be known for debunking urban legends, hoaxes, and folklore, but our journalistic efforts go far beyond that. Investigations into inauthentic behavior seek to expose bad actors and their methods. These stories also document patterns of the shortcomings of social media platforms, in particular when it comes to U.S. politics.Facebook appears to have taken action on a popular Facebook Group themed for White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany. Official Kayleigh McEnany Fan Page disappeared in October 2020. There is no indication that McEnany or the White House had any involvement with it. The private group was created on May 1, 2020, and built up more than 475,000 members, an average growth of almost 100,000 members per month.These numbers bear similarities to another group that Snopes reported on after Facebook removed it in August. That group, Kayleigh McEnany Official, was managed from North Macedonia and had more than 456,000 members. Facebook told us in September that Kayleigh McEnany Official was removed ""as part of routine enforcement against spammy and inauthentic behavior because it used a range of deceptive techniques to boost their popularity on our platform."" They also told us that the group's management ""used compromised accounts to mislead people about its origin, make their content appear more popular than it is, and drive them to off-platform domains filled with pay-per click ads and to YouTube."":The more recently removed Official Kayleigh McEnany Fan Page does not appear to have been run from North Macedonia, but it may have been taken down for similar reasons.

Zulu's account has a different last name in its URL, facebook.com/nicholaszeller. Hart's account has since disappeared from Facebook.

Zulu posted that day: ""Quality content to honor Kayleigh, Trump, Conservatives, and Jesus."" The group reached 400,000 members by July 30, after only being created three months earlier.:Earlier, when Official Kayleigh McEnany Fan Page only had 40,000 members, Zulu posted ""WWG1WGA.""

The Associated Press reported: ""Facebook said it will ban groups that openly support QAnon, the baseless conspiracy theory that paints President Donald Trump as a secret warrior against a supposed child-trafficking ring run by celebrities and 'deep state' government officials.""Posts about QAnon may have been one of the reasons that Facebook took action on the group. Zulu also tweeted about QAnon::In our research for this story we found a connection to previous reporting.

Immediately, in what has become a deeply troubling (yet entirely predictable) pattern, Internet trolls took the tragedy as yet another opportunity to hawk ""false flag"" conspiracy theories.:Before the families of massacre victims even had the chance to bury their loved ones, disreputable outlets and personalities like InfoWars' Alex Jones began claiming without evidence the shooting was a ""false flag,"" or a government operation carried out for the purpose of seizing guns from Americans.Alex Leary, Washington bureau chief for the Tampa Bay Times, reported that an aide for Florida Rep. Shawn Harrison had claimed in an official e-mail that child survivors of the Florida shooting were ""crisis actors"" who travel around the country posing as victims in mass shootings:Here's the email. I asked for more information to back up the claim and was sent another email that linked to a YouTube conspiracy video. pic.twitter.com/VRSVOcjj3E-- Alex Leary (@learyreports) February 20, 2018I was just made aware that my aide made an insensitive and inappropriate allegation about Parkland students today. I have spoken to him and placed him on leave until we determine an appropriate course of action. I do not share his opinion and he did so without my knowledge.-- Shawn Harrison (@Shawnfor63) February 20, 2018:I've been terminated from the State House. I made a mistake whereas I tried to inform a reporter of information relating to his story regarding a school shooting. This was not my responsibility. I meant no disrespect to the students or parents of Parkland.-- Benjamin Kelly (@benakelly) February 20, 2018Others pounced on a Google search engine glitch that mischaracterizes the publishing dates of news stories to claim reports about the shooting were posted in advance. For example, a site dedicated to anti-Semitic conspiracy theorist Henry Makow posted an image of the Google search results and claimed there were ""crisis actors"" and multiple shooters, both common conspiracy theory motifs.Images like this one circulated on the message board 4chan and various other disreputable web sites::It might look damning, except that this screenshot shows nothing more than the result of a known glitch with Google that sometimes shows the wrong dates in search results, as a Google spokeswoman told us: Listing the date and time for news stories is complicated, as there is no universal standard used. Sometimes, stories have no date and time on the webpage. Sometimes, a story may appear on a page that lists related stories, and they all have different dates and times shown. Sometimes a publisher might be in a different time zone and the date gets picked up incorrectly. All these things may cause us to occasionally list the wrong date. We're looking at ways to improve.Google's public search liaison Danny Sullivan addressed the issue on Twitter, explaining why some of the article dates were misleading:The time comes from this embedded in the story's code:datetime=""2018-02-14T14:40:35+00:00""That means the story is as of 2:40pm UTC -- IE Greenwich time, not Miami time. The publication likely forgot to set the time zone to Miami, mistakenly reporting it five hours early.-- Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) February 14, 2018:The first is because we picked up the wrong date for a related article at the end. The others are going to be similar. We can get the wrong date for a variety of reasons. pic.twitter.com/tpKtRqrPr6-- Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) February 14, 2018The ""false flag"" conspiracy theory is applied almost as a reflexive reaction to promote unfounded fears of a government takeover, which will be preceded by a forcible national gun grab (although there's never any explanation offered for how a government entity might be clever enough to keep the same hoax with the same people going over and over again for years but too stupid to be able to orchestrate a full takeover).Although it is hardly original, it is sadly employed as grounds to harass victims of mass shootings. Since at least the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, the families of shooting victims have been relentlessly harassed. One conspiracy theorist was sentenced to prison for sending a death threat to the father of a child who was killed in that shooting.:"
568,568,420.DidanAnonymous4chanU,"Claim:An anonymous 4chan user predicted the October 2017 Las Vegas Strip mass shooting.Rating:UnprovenAbout this rating In early October 2017, a rumor surfaced online alleging that a person using only the name ""john"" on the messaging board 4chan had ""predicted"" the mass shooting in Las Vegas on 1 October 2017.Police say a 64-year-old gunman opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on a crowd of 22,000 people gathered below for the Route 91 Harvest Festival at 10:05 p.m. on 1 October. The attacker had modified a semi-automatic firearm so that it fired like an automatic, and for roughly ten minutes he sprayed the concert crowd with bullets, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds.:As with many mass casualty incidents in recent history, conspiracy theorists immediately pounced, claiming without proof, for example, that there was a second gunman on the fourth floor of the hotel or that internet sleuths had spotted footage of the shooter at an anti-Trump rally. In keeping with this pattern, conspiracy-minded web sites Neon Nettle and WorldTruth.tv posted identical stories claiming that an anonymous 4chan user predicted the Las Vegas Strip massacre three weeks before it occurred. NeonNettle reported:The ominous warning was left on the anonymous message boards on the 16th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The user warned people to ""stay away"" from Las Vegas due to a coming deadly attack. The mysterious 4chan user, who went only by the name ""John"", made a series of, at the time, overlooked posts. He warned other users to avoid gatherings of large groups of people in the Vegas or nearby Henderson areas. John claimed to have inside knowledge of, what he referred to as, a ""high incident project"" that was due to take place soon.The messages posted by ""John"" on either 10 September or 11 September 2017 (depending where you look) don't in fact predict any specific catastrophe -- he only said vaguely that some kind of incident would occur the following day in Las Vegas or Henderson, and that a harbinger of this disaster will be ""three black vans parked next to either."":According an alleged screen shot and archive of his comments, reposted to 4chan the day after the shooting (with the thread title, ""Anon 'jon' predicted Vegas attack"") the anonymous user issued the warning a day before the 16th anniversary of the 11 September terrorist attack, which could point to a troll trying to drum up fear as the anniversary approached. The user wrote:look i feel bad for some of you on this website. so i'll let you in on a little secret. if you live in las vegas or henderson stay inside tomorrow. don't go anywhere where there are large groups of people. also if you see three blacks vans parked next to each other immediately leave the area. you're welcome-john[...]it's called the ""high incident project"". they want to make the american public think that places with extremely high security aren't safe. they are trying to create more regulations. you will see laws proposed within the next few years to put up more metal detectors and other security devices. media and politicians will be saying places with lots of police need even more police. i can't guarantee anything will happen tomorrow but las vegas is on their minds.-john:[...]if their plan is successful state of nevada will pass a law in the future making all casinos have mandatory metal detectors and backscatter machines. soon after a federal law will be passed to put these machines in universities, high schools, federal buildings, you name it. osi systems and chertoff are the main producers of these machines. sometime around 2020 chertoff and osi will merge into a single company. after they merge the owners will sell off all their stock and make billions in profit. mr chertoff has been in contact with sheldon adelson. mr adelson will become a huge sponsor of these machines and he will be the first to put them in his casinos when the law passes. this is my last message for now. don't expect me to return anytime soon-johnAlthough some 4chan users questioned whether the person who wrote the posts was the Las Vegas gunman, others didn't seem impressed at all, saying the user had a habit of regularly posting vague predictions. As one person pointed out, ""Make 1000 predictions a year and a couple will come true."" Another 4chan user noted that the name ""john"" may reference John Titor, a message board hoax from the early 2000s that depicted a time traveling soldier from the future who made bogus predictions about catastrophic events.:We don't know who posted these messages, nor do we know whether the person who did so posts similar messages regularly. They gave the wrong date and didn't refer to any specifics that would point to knowledge predicting the Strip attack. The aspect of the prediction that was correct was the location, but even that was general. Predictably both Neon Nettle and WorldTruth.tv used the posts to support the claim that the attack was a ""false flag"" -- a prevailing conspiracy theory that posits mass casualty incidents are engineered by the government to serve as pretense for heightened security and surveillance, and/or tighter gun control legislation."

The new version contained contemporaneous references to the Chinese Chang'e-4 spacecraft's making the first ever soft landing on the far side of the moon::Top officials of the Chinese Space Program have come out this week and expressed their skepticism that the American Moon landings ever happened, reports the Beijing Daily Express.More than 2,000 high-ranking officials of the Chinese Communist Party have signed a petition this week asking explanations from the American government concerning the American Moon landings after doubts arose that the Apollo Moon landings ever happened.These allegations have come up after recent analysis of pictures taken from the Chinese Chang'e-4 probe allegedly found no traces of the American Moon landings existing on the Moon.Several high-ranking members of the Chinese Communist Party even stated publicly that these latest findings proved without a doubt that the Moon landings were an ""elaborately orchestrated hoax to fool the world about America's space program capabilities"".The WNDR article was not factual, of course.  It was just a bit of junk news playing on the long-running conspiracy theory holding that the six U.S. manned lunar landings which took place from 1969-72 were all faked.:WNDR's disclaimer notes that the site's content is ""satirical"" and ""fictional"" in nature."
570,570,161.DoesThisPhotographSh,"Claim:A photograph shows a young Barack Obama with Saudi Arabian prince Al-Waleed bin Talal.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In November 2018, a purported photograph of a young Barack Obama began making its way around social media, attached to the claim that it pictured the former president during his college years with Saudi prince Al-Waleed bin Talal::No evidence (beyond a vague resemblance) suggests that this photograph features Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal. Furthermore, an investigation into the gestation of this conspiracy theory shows that it was pulled from thin air.This photograph doesn't appear to have any official origin trail. We could not find it archived by news photo outlets such as Getty Images or the Associated Press, nor could we locate it any galleries covering Barack Obama's college years. The earliest posting of this image (sans black arrow) that we could uncover came from a March 2013 Reddit discussion about a different picture of Barack Obama's mother. Reddit user ""einmalistkeinmal"" claimed to have received the photograph circa 2008 and stated it was taken by a friend's drug dealer's father who used to be friends with Obama ""back in the day"":I have a unique picture of Obama from that time period as well:I got the picture about 5 years ago from a friend. Apparently their grower's dad used to hang out with Obama, the original caption was ""My dad and Barry back in the day"":While this third-hand information is certainly not enough to confirm the context of this photograph (or even document that the man in the white shirt is truly Barack Obama), it does demonstrate that this photograph predates the ""Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal"" claim by several years and was originally shared with a rather harmless caption. (We reached out to ""einmalistkeinmal"" for more information about the photograph but have yet to hear back.)This unverified image of Barack Obama in college received little attention over the next few years, but in September 2018 a ""Qanon"" conspiracy theorist shared a version which obscured one man's face and offered the picture to followers with the insinuation that it indicated Barack Obama was homosexual::A number of Twitter users chimed in to guess the identity of the ""masked"" man. While most pushed the idea that the faceless man was actually Michelle Obama (a certain sect of the population maintains, without evidence, that the former first lady was once a man), others posited that it showed members of the Muslim brotherhood, a mysteriously murdered boyfriend, or ""Christine Blasey Ford's uncle.""The Q community, 4chan, and the pro-Donald Trump section of Reddit r/The_Donald, however, started to push the rumor that this image featured Saudi prince Al-Waleed bin Talal. Why? Most likely to support a small portion of the ever-expanding ""Q"" conspiracy theory which holds that bin Talal paid for Barack Obama to attend Harvard Law School.No evidence has been presented to show that this person is truly Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal. Furthermore, a side-by-side comparison of the man in the viral photograph (left) and bin Talal from 1996 (right) show that the two men don't bear much of a resemblance. Particularly, Al-Waleed bin Talal has a much lighter complexion than his mysterious counterpart and a mole on his right cheek that the ""mystery"" man does not share::We have not been able to positively identify the people in this photograph. It is likely, however, that if this image hasn't been doctored, it simply captures Barack Obama with one of his Pakistani friends from his days at Occidental College. Obama's freshman roommate was a Pakistani man named Imad Husain, and the former president quickly became friends with two other Pakistanis, Mohammed Hasan Chandoo and Wahid Hamid.:"

This post was created in an attempt to falsely connect Zuckerberg to QAnon, a baseless and unwieldy conspiracy theory holding that Democrats, liberals, technology leaders, and members of Hollywood (basically anyone that the conspiracy theorists wants to smear) are involved with satanism, child sex trafficking, and other nefarious deeds. :This post never appeared on Zuckerberg's Facebook page, and the included photograph was not taken on Little St. James, an island in the Virgin Islands that was once owned by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This photograph was actually taken in 2012 during a trip Zuckerberg took to Maui, Hawaii.  When this image made the rounds on 4chan in 2020, a spokesperson for Facebook told the Journal.ie: ""[This post] was not published on Mark Zuckerberg's profile.""It's also worth noting that while conspiracy theorists claim that ""adrenochrome"" is a widely used psychedelic drug that is harvested from the adrenal glands of a human body, that's not the case. This myth was popularized in the book (and the movie) ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,"" but it's not based in reality.Men's Health wrote:Adrenochrome is a chemical that's a byproduct of adrenaline. That's it. It turns out you don't need to kidnap children and drain their blood. There are many trusted chemical suppliers, in fact--which we won't be linking to, sorry--that sell it.Back in the '50s, scientists speculated that adrenochrome caused schizophrenia. Take a megadose of vitamin C, one researcher concluded, and adrenochrome along with schizophrenia should vanish. That...didn't work, alas.But the lack of real science didn't stop adrenochrome from sounding cool enough to make it into drug lit classics like Aldous Huxley's The Doors of Perception and Anthony Burgess' A Clockwork Orange.The source of the myth that you need to steal adrenochrome from a corpse goes back to a fun scene in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, in which Dr. Gonzo, Hunter S. Thompson's ""attorney,"" says adrenochrome ""makes pure mescaline seem like ginger beer."" Later, it is explained that ""there's only one source for this stuff--the adrenaline gland from a living human body."" It's an easy mistake to make, but please know that Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is not a documentary feature made from archival footage of actual events.:"
572,572,666.DidNewsweekReportTha,"Claim:Newsweek magazine reported that President Trump would be impeached and replaced by Hillary Clinton.Rating:FalseAbout this rating What's TrueNewsweek offered a law professor's hypothetical musings about how Hillary Clinton could still become president if Donald Trump's 2016 win was proved to have been the result of a corrupted election process. What's FalseNewsweek neither reported that President Trump would be impeached, nor that, if so, he would be replaced by Hillary Clinton.:Back in October 2017, Lawrence Lessig, the Roy L. Furman professor of law and leadership at Harvard Law School, penned a short speculative essay about ""What should happen if the unthinkable happens"" -- that is, what steps the U.S. government should take if the investigation by Robert Mueller, head of the Special Counsel investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, should find ""specifically damaging evidence about the President"" regarding a conspiracy with the Russians to affect the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. The gist of Lessig's piece was that in the case of a tainted presidential election, the U.S. Constitution provides no mechanism for holding a new election or otherwise installing the ""proper"" winner in office -- the most that could happen under current law would be for the sitting President to be impeached and removed from office (or resign), with the Vice President (or someone else in the line of succession) taking his place:There's no mechanism in American law for a new election. Nor is there a mechanism for correcting the criminal results of the previous election.The question I'm asking here is what should happen if Trump conspired with a foreign government to get elected? If he did that, then what should happen.If that is shown, then the first step is obvious. Trump should resign or, if he doesn't, he should be impeached.The second step should be obvious as well: Pence should resign or, if he doesn't, he should be impeached. He benefited from the criminal (and treasonous) conspiracy just as much as Trump. He shouldn't benefit even more by becoming the residual President.Under the law as it is, this leaves Paul Ryan as President. And the hard moral question that Ryan would then face is whether he should remain as President. By hypothesis, we're assuming the office was effectively stolen from the legitimate winner by a criminal and treasonous act of the (previous) leader of Ryan's own party. Ryan's being President is just the fruit of that poisonous tree. So should he just ignore that? Or should he acknowledge the wrong, and act to make it right?:Lessig thereupon provided a possible (if far-fetched) scenario under which losing presidential candidate Hillary Clinton could still become president under existing law:President Ryan would have the right to nominate a Vice-President. That right is specified in the 25th Amendment. That nominee then becomes Vice-President once confirmed by a majority of both houses. That's how Gerald Ford became Vice President. And that's how he eventually became President without ever running for that office.If Ryan became President because the Trump/Pence campaign committed treason, who should he nominate as his Vice President? The answer seems unavoidable: He should nominate the person defeated by the treason of his own party, and then step aside, and let her become the President.Lessig's essay was  picked up by Newsweek magazine, and as the law professor noted in a preface he added to the original, their reference to his piece prompted some rather vitriolic reaction::The piece was picked up by Newsweek, and astonishingly (for Newsweek), all my qualifications were stripped away. Mine wasn't an essay mapping the consequences under our Constitution of a hypothetical that people are actually asking about; it was a fantasy piece by a liberal law professor dreaming about how Clinton could become President. That caught the attention of Rush Limbaugh (yea, you'll have to find that link yourself), who, knickers twisted, lambasted me on his radio show. I only knew this because scores of outraged Rushies rushed in to discipline me, offering free advice about whether I was a ""moron"" or worse, and disgusted at the idea that someone like me was teaching law. Tucker Carlson then asked me to come on his show. And amazingly (and to his credit) he allowed me plenty of time to set the context and explain the piece. He even affirmed that if the hypothetical were true, he'd be ""leading the charge"" to have Trump removed. But by the end, he too got all pc about whether I should write such pieces. It was a kind of ""pornography,"" he suggested, and wrong for me to write.Newsweek revisted Lessig's essay in January 2018, and the author pointed out that he was not declaring that President Trump had been part of ""some conspiracy to steal the election,"" nor was he asserting that the scenario he described for putting Hillary Clinton in office would (or should) happen; he was merely speculating about what could happen in one very specific circumstance::""This is one way it could happen,"" Lessig said. ""But that's very different from saying I think it will happen, or should happen, or [that] the evidence is there for it to happen.""Since the essay was published, there hasn't been ""any evidence that's come out that's resolved the question, whether there was some conspiracy to steal the election,"" the professor said.""I don't feel that we've seen anything that increases that probability,"" he added.If evidence that Trump and his team conspired to steal the election did emerge in the future, however, the president would have to step down, Lessig maintained.""Absolutely, he's got to resign, and if he doesn't resign, then absolutely Congress needs to impeach him,"" he said of the hypothetical situation.Lessig noted that the hypotheticals he wrote about in his essay would apply to only the specific scenario he described.""The remedy that I ... outline[d] only makes sense if you believe the election was stolen,"" he said. ""If you don't believe the election was stolen, there might have been a hundred other things [Trump] did that would lead you to believe he ought to be removed, but none of those justify the remedy I described."":Nonetheless, some dubious web sites pushed out clickbait headlines inaccurately blaring to viewers that: ""Newsweek Reports That Trump Will Be Impeached and Replaced by Hillary Clinton"":But Newsweek neither reported that President Trump would be impeached, nor that, if so, he would be replaced by Hillary Clinton -- they simply offered one person's hypothetical musings about how those events could occur (even though it was admittedly highly unlikely they ever would).:"

Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the main author of a memo about Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election that House Intelligence Committee members voted to declassify. The 10-page document compiled by Democrats is a rebuttal to a separate, controversial memo authored by Republicans and released days earlier in what has become a partisan battle over an ongoing special-counsel-led investigation into Russian meddling and alleged collusion by Donald Trump's campaign. Schiff, who has become one of President Trump's most vocal critics in relation to the probe, traded barbs with Trump over Twitter:Mr. President, I see you've had a busy morning of ""Executive Time."" Instead of tweeting false smears, the American people would appreciate it if you turned off the TV and helped solve the funding crisis, protected Dreamers or...really anything else. https://t.co/lVqQRu2Gjl-- Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) February 5, 2018:Little Adam Schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper!

Hamilton68, a live dashboard created by the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan, transatlantic initiative of The German Marshall Fund, monitors the Russian operation. Around the time of the vote on the second memo's release, Schiff's name was a top topic and the hashtag #littleadamschiff was popular among Russian bot accounts::As the Hamilton68 researchers have pointed out, the influence operation relies on various fake news sites and media personalities to push the desired narrative -- including what Hamilton68 calls ""white,"" ""gray,"" and ""black"" measures. ""White measures"" include overt propaganda outlets like RT, which don't hide their Kremlin backing. ""Gray measures,"" on the other hand, have unclear funding and motivations. The sources of funding and motivations of ""black measures"" are deceptively hidden:This ""white"" content provides ammunition for ""gray"" measures, which employ less overt outlets controlled by Russia, as well as so-called useful idiots that regurgitate Russian themes and ""facts"" without necessarily taking direction from Russia or collaborating in a fully informed manner.[...]A small army of social media operatives -- a mix of Russian-controlled accounts, useful idiots, and innocent bystanders -- are deployed to promote all of this material to unknowing audiences. Some of these are real people, others are bots, and some present themselves as innocent news aggregators, providing ""breaking news alerts"" to happenings worldwide or in specific cities. The latter group is a key tool for moving misinformation and disinformation from primarily Russian-influenced circles into the general social media population.:As of 6 February 2018, this network was in full swing, with Russian bots and trolls utilizing President Trump's derogatory nickname for the congressman with the hashtag #LittleAdamSchiff. Fake news and rumors circulated reporting Schiff's sister was married to the son of billionaire philanthropist (and frequent target of conspiracy theories) George Soros -- despite the fact that Schiff does not have a sister. The false information wended its way from the message board 4chan to a corollary of disreputable web sites and social media posts.Spot fires of other false rumors and questionable reporting popped up as well -- for example, the conspiracy theory  site TheDuran.com claimed that Schiff had ""colluded"" with a Ukrainian oligarch, offering no other evidence than a 2013 fundraiser for Schiff held by Kazakhstan-born businessman Igor Pasternak, who has strong ties to Ukraine and who runs a small airships manufacturing company in Montebello, California. In 2017, Newsweek reported that Pasternak's company, Aeroscraft, had partnered with a state-run Ukrainian defense manufacturer to produce a variant of the M16 assault rifle for the Ukrainian armed forces. On 6 February 2018 the British tabloid Daily Mail, along with right wing web sites including Breitbart and The Daily Caller regurgitated the original reporting of journalist Julia Ioffe in The Atlantic, part of which revealed Schiff had taken a phone call in April 2017 from two Russian ""pranksters"" impersonating a Ukrainian politician who led him to believe they had information about the Russia investigation. Ioffe's report includes a key detail the aggregators neglected -- the ""pranksters,"" Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexey Stolyarov, may have Kremlin ties.:Some social media accounts denouncing Schiff linked to a screenshot of a purported 4chan post that read: ""Blunt & Direct Time. Adam Schiff is a traitor to our country. Leaker. NAT SEC. EVIL. Tick Tock. Hope the $7.8mm was worth it. Enjoy the show. Q.""

Now a faction within the movement has been interpreting the Bible through QAnon conspiracies.I have been studying the growth of the QAnon movement as part of my research into how extremist religious and political organizations create propaganda and recruit new members to ideological causes.On Feb. 23, I logged onto Zoom to observe the first public service of what is essentially a QAnon church operating out of the Omega Kingdom Ministry (OKM). I've spent 12 weeks attending this two-hour Sunday morning service.What I've witnessed is an existing model of neo-charismatic home churches   -- the neo-charismatic movement is an offshoot of evangelical Protestant Christianity and is made up of thousands of independent organizations  -- where QAnon conspiracy theories are reinterpreted through the Bible. In turn, QAnon conspiracy theories serve as a lens to interpret the Bible itself. :Trump vs. the 'deep state'The QAnon movement began in 2017 after someone known only as Q posted a series of conspiracy theories about Trump on the internet forum 4chan. QAnon followers believe global elites are seeking to bring down Trump, whom they see as the world's only hope to defeat the ""deep state.""OKM is part of a network of independent congregations (or ekklesia) called Home Congregations Worldwide (HCW). The organization's spiritual adviser is Mark Taylor, a self-proclaimed ""Trump Prophet"" and QAnon influencer with a large social media following on Twitter and YouTube. :The website of Omega Kingdom Ministries mixes QAnon theories and biblical references.The resource page of the HCW website only links to QAnon propaganda   -- including the documentary Fall Cabal by Dutch conspiracy theorist Janet Ossebaard, which is used to formally indoctrinate e-congregants into QAnon. This 10-part YouTube series was the core material for the weekly Bible study during QAnon church sessions I observed.The Sunday service is led by Russ Wagner, leader of the Indiana-based OKM, and Kevin Bushey, a retired colonel running for election to the Maine House of Representatives.Bible and QAnon narrativesThe service begins with an opening prayer from Wagner that he says will protect the Zoom room from Satan. This is followed by an hour-long Bible study where Wagner might explain the Fall Cabal video that attendees had just watched or offer his observations on socio-political events from the previous week.:Everything is explained though the lens of the Bible and QAnon narratives. Bushey then does 45 minutes of decoding items that have appeared recently on the app called QMap that is used to share conspiracy theories. The last 15 minutes are dedicated to communion and prayer.At a service held on April 26, Wagner and Bushey spoke about a QAnon theory, called Project Looking Glass, that the U.S. military has secretly developed a form of time-travel technology. Wagner suggested to e-congregants that time travel can be explained by certain passages in the Bible.On May 3, the theme of the QAnon portion of the service was about COVID-19. Bushey spoke about a popular QAnon theory that the pandemic was planned. (There is no evidence of this.) And when an anti-vax conspiracy theory documentary called ""Plandemic"" went viral , the video was shared on the HCW websites as a way for e-congregants to consume the latest in a series of false theories about the coronavirus.Leveraging authority:What is clear is that Wagner and Bushey are leveraging religious beliefs and their ""authority"" as a pastor and ex-military officer to indoctrinate attendees into the QAnon church. Their objective is to train congregants to form their own home congregations in the future and grow the movement.Followers of the QAnon movement regularly show their support for Donald Trump at his political rallies, including this one held in Pennsylvania in 2018.(Shutterstock)OKM's ministry is rooted in Taylor's prophecies. Wagner regularly mentions that if it wasn't for Taylor, he would have never started this ministry.On its website, OKM references the Seven Mountains of Societal Influence. Seven Mountains utilizes the language of Dominionism  -- a theology that believes countries, including the United States, should be governed by Christian biblical law. Its goal is to attain sociopolitical and economic transformation through the gospel of Jesus in what it calls the seven mountains or spheres of society: religion, family, education, government, media, entertainment and business. This blends QAnon's apocalyptic desire to destroy society ""controlled"" by the deep state with the need for the Kingdom of God on Earth.:Wagner and Bushey have taught their congregation to stop listening to any media   --even Fox News   -- because they're are all ""Luciferian."" What they provide instead is a road map to QAnon radicalization comprised of QAnon YouTube channels for the congregation's daily media diet, the Qmap website that lists new QAnon conspiracy theories and Twitter influencers.'Deep state church'They further insist that as Trump continues to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington, it's ""our"" responsibility to drain the deep state church swamp. They believe the same deep state that controls the world has also infiltrated traditional churches. As Wagner stated in his April 12 service: ""I am here to focus on the deep state church. This goes beyond our church and involves our culture and our politics. Kevin is here to talk about QAnon and the military operation to save the world.""Like any church, they also run outreach ministries. OKM is currently raising funds for something called Reclamation Ranch, which Wagner describes as a safe place for children rescued after being held underground by the deep state. Children at risk is an ongoing theme in many QAnon conspiracy theories, including the famous fake ""Pizzagate"" theory.:As of May, OKM moved from Zoom to YouTube to accommodate the growth in attendees. At last count, approximately 300 accounts participated in the recent services.While that's not a lot of followers, we should be concerned about these latest developments. OKM provides formalized religious indoctrination into QAnon, a conspiracy movement that is both a public health threat by spreading false information about the coronavirus pandemic and a national security concern.:Marc-Andre Argentino, PhD candidate Individualized Program, 2020-2021 Public Scholar, Concordia UniversityThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

In recent years, the WEF -- an annual meeting of wealthy and powerful business and political leaders -- has regularly become a central character in conspiracies about a global elite secretly restructuring society in their favor. :These so-called ""great reset"" conspiracies often include claims about the COVID-19 pandemic as a tool for the elite to exert their control. In this context, claims about the vaccination status of pilots transporting WEF participants went viral in the days before the WEF officially opened on Jan. 16, 2023. In service of a belief that these ""elites"" know more about the purported dangers and evils of COVID-19 vaccination, several anti-vaccine groups began pushing claims that wealthy participants of the WEF required or had requested non-vaccinated pilots for their safety. The alleged reason? An unfounded assertion that vaccinated pilots have a higher risk of cardiac complications compared to non-vaccinated ones, and therefore they risk ""dying suddenly"" mid-flight. The unfounded assertion that vaccinated airline pilots have a higher risk of dropping dead is a central claim animating a group of commercial pilots named ""U.S. Freedom Flyers."" Snopes investigated similar claims in July and October 2021 and found them without merit. The claim that wealthy elites were requesting unvaccinated pilots for Davos, in this case, stemmed from an interview with Alan Dana, a former commercial pilot, shared on Infowars : :In that interview, Dana repeated second-hand information originating, allegedly, from the founder of the U.S. Freedom Flyers, Josh Loder:Former Jetstar pilot Alan Dana claimed the wealthy are seeking out unvaccinated pilots to fly their private jets. Dana said Josh Yoder, the head [of] the U.S. Freedom Flyers, ... is receiving inquiries from elites interested in hiring unvaccinated pilots to fly their business trips.This quote generated headlines on similarly disreputable conspiracy outlets suggesting the WEF itself was seeking these pilots. For example, the conspiracy peddler NewsPunch ran a story with the headline: ""WEF Hires Unvaccinated Pilots To Fly Them Into Davos,"" which claimed that WEF Founder and Chairman ""Klaus Schwab ... banned vaccinated pilots from transporting ... members in and out of Davos due to the safety risk they pose.""Loder, on Twitter, denied ever suggesting that the WEF was seeking these pilots. Instead he said that ""wealthy businessmen have reached out to me for"" the purpose of finding unvaccinated pilots to fly them to Davos. This claim is wholly unverifiable, and comes from an activist who regularly promotes conspiracy theorists while suggesting that Anthony Fauci is a Nazi. :Because the WEF is not seeking unvaccinated pilots, and because the alleged source of this claim explicitly rejected that interpretation, the headline claims about the WEF's preference for unvaccinated pilots is ""False.""

We stand in support of our community,"" CBP tweeted. ""Despite false rumors to the contrary, ICE does not conduct immigration enforcement operations during tragedies like the one that recently impacted El Paso, Texas,"" ICE tweeted.Please be aware that CBP personnel including Border Patrol agents + Field Operations officers have returned to their regular duties.

(4/5)-- ICE (@ICEgov) August 4, 2019:Twenty-two people were killed and dozens wounded in the Saturday morning attack at a busy Walmart near Cielo Vista Mall, a commercial destination popular with cross-border shoppers. In the aftermath of the massacre, survivors were reunited with loved ones at an impromptu family-reunification center established at McCarthur Middle School, about three-quarters of a mile away from the scene.Panic was compounded by a viral Facebook post that claimed immigration agents were conducting enforcement checks at the school.:We sent questions to the Facebook user who created the post, asking where he got the information and whether he had any evidence that it was true. According to his profile, he is based in the state of Virginia. We received no response by the time of publication.No evidence exists that ICE or CBP agents were conducting immigration checks on people affected by the mass shooting. Per ICE, enforcement operations are targeted by way of investigative leads, not random checks. Further, except under specific circumstances, ICE doesn't conduct enforcement activities at ""sensitive locations,"" such as hospitals and schools. CBP has a similar policy.That's not to diminish the fear experienced by some shooting victims and survivors. Monsignor Arturo Banuelas, an immigrant-rights advocate and chair of the Hope Border Institute in El Paso, was on hand to help in the shooting's aftermath. He told NPR that the sight of immigration agents stationed outside the reunification center had a chilling effect on some people looking for loved ones.""I was at the reunification center waiting with the families, waiting to hear news of their loved ones,"" Banuelas told NPR's David Greene. ""It was a nightmare for families ... Some of the families were not able to, did not show up to see if their loved ones were there because they were afraid that they would be deported because the place was surrounded by Border Patrol as well as the police."":Banuelas said he also heard about a person injured in the attack who didn't seek treatment at a hospital because of fear immigration agents would deport victims and separate them from their families.Nonetheless, Banuelas said families should go to hospitals and the reunification center to find loved ones: ""We're there, there's a lot of people who are willing to help,"" Banuelas told Greene. ""At moments like this, I think there's more compassion and more understanding of people's pain. I mean even people have families, the police, the ICE people, the Border Patrol, they have families, they understand these moments and I think in moments of crisis like this -- there's people, there were priests, there were chaplains there, we would be able to be of service to them. I would say, come, we'll help you.""Prosecutors have charged Patrick Crusius, 21, in the shooting spree. Crusius allegedly posted a manifesto online before the attack in which he parroted a white supremacist conspiracy theory that immigrants are ""invading"" the United States.

But the rumor's purportedly shocking details originated with (and were reported by no source other than) the fake news site WhatDoesItMean.com, described by RationalWiki thusly:Sorcha Faal is the alleged author of an ongoing series of ""reports"" published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don't think much of it.Each report resembles a news story in its style but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don't contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish.Whatdoesitmean.com has perpetuated a number of baseless Clinton conspiracy theories during the 2016 election including falsehoods holding hacker Guccifer, Democratic National Committee (DNC) staffer Seth Rich, UN official John Ashe, and the father of a physician purportedly responsible for leaking Hillary Clinton's (falsified) health records were killed off by her shadowy operatives.:On 18 January 2017, a news outlet reported Braverman had taken a new job (in Menlo Park, not Moscow):Eric Braverman, the former CEO of the Clinton Foundation, has been hired to oversee the non-investment side of the family office of Alphabet Inc.

The visual comparison, which has also worked its way into the Qanon conspiracy theory, is commonly shared with the caption: ""Does the new Antifa flag remind you of anything?"":::The bottom image does not actually picture the state flag of Germany during the era of Nazi rule, but rather the Reichskriegsflagge, a war ensign used by the German armed forces from 1933 to 1945.  More important, the top image does not show an Antifa flag, but rather a digitally manipulated version of a flag used by the National Front, a far-right, fascist political party in the United Kingdom.The original photograph was taken from a January 2016 demonstration in Dover which, ironically, featured a clash between far-right demonstrators and anti-fascists. In other words, members of Antifa were protesting against the group represented by this flag when the picture was snapped:Three people were arrested amid violent scenes as groups demonstrating against immigration clashed with anti-racism protesters in Dover.Smoke bombs were let off and bricks thrown as police turned out in force to oversee hundreds of far-right demonstrators marching through town.They clashed with anti-fascist demonstrators, leaving five people with minor injuries.:Here's a look at the original image (left) and the doctored Antifa flag image (right):The scene can be glimpsed around the 1:05 mark of this video from the 2016 protests in Dover:A variation of this meme featured another version of the ""New Antifa Flag""::Again, however, this is not a banner  we've found any genuine Antifa groups to be using in earnest. This design was actually created by Deviant Artist ""Linumhortulanus"" as a means of denigrating the anti-fascist group:After hearing about the terrible revolts of far-left extremists in Hamburg (this year's location of the G-20 summit) I felt like I had to make them a new ... and more appropriate flag! It's inspired by the national socialist war ensign of Germany. It's supposed to symbolize that the extremism of far-left organizations like the ANTIFA is the same ... or rather ... as harmful as the extremism of far-right movements ...I think that far-left extremism is a big danger for the people of Germany. I made this to remind everyone that organizations like the ANTIFA are just as harmful and violent as neonazi gangs.Antifa consists of a loose network of like-minded groups but has no central organizing body.

579,579,603.JadeHelmConcludes,"NEWS:   The conspiracy-fraught military exercise dubbed Jade Helm 15 has officially ended, without heralding martial law or a hostile takeover of Texas.      In early 2015, conspiracy theories about the U.S. domestic military exercises known as Jade Helm (or Jade Helm 15) inspired a flurry of rumors on the Internet, such as this early iteration of rumor:Many people both in and out of the media have assumed that ""Jade Helm"" was to be a training exercise to test and develop tactics to protect the Southwest from an invasion by a foreign government, drug cartels, or possibly terrorist organization. However, the Operational Plan for the exercise clearly shows that this drill is about the implementation of martial law and the subsequent pacification and subjugation of the American people by their government.By mid-March 2015, Jade Helm conspiracy rumors became a nuisance for the military; on that date, military news source Stars and Stripes published an article titled ""Army Special Operations Command Pushes Back Against Alarmist Claims About Upcoming Exercise"" in which U.S. Army Lt. Col. Mark Lastoria attempted to dispel the increasingly widespread scuttlebutt::""That notion was proposed by a few individuals who are unfamiliar with how and why USASOC conducts training exercises,"" he said in an email. ""This exercise is routine training to maintain a high level of readiness for Army Special Operations Forces because they must be ready to support potential missions anywhere in the world on a moment's notice.""He said the only thing unique about this particular exercise, which is slated to take place between July 15 and Sept. 15, is ""the use of new challenging terrain"" which was chosen because it is similar to conditions special operations forces operate in overseas.In April 2015, the Jade Helm rumors were partially catalyzed by speculation over the sudden and concurrent closure of several Walmart stores in states named in the exercise. Those rumors intensified when Walmart claimed the affected locations had been closed (abruptly and simultaneously) due to ""plumbing problems."" Social media users began sharing photographs they claimed depicted sinister Jade Helm activities:4/21/2015 - Warner, OK @ 1:28am - Headed to Texas via 1-40 - Navy #JADEHELM15 pic.twitter.com/SGYtZeTqve-- #JADEHELM15 (@JadeHelm15Intel) April 21, 2015: Lt. Col. Lastoria's reassurances didn't do much to quell growing fear of Jade Helm (particularly in Texas), and on 27 April 2015 he spoke at a contentious town hall meeting in Bastrop, Texas. The following day, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott arguably validated (and mainstreamed) those concerns via Twitter:I've ordered the Texas State Guard to monitor Jade Helm 15 to safeguard Texans' constitutional rights, private property & civil liberties-- Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) April 28, 2015 On the same date, Gov. Abbott sent a letter outlining his concerns about Jade Helm and its potential effects on his constituents. Rumors of near-operational Jade Helm camps subsequently sprang up, and an unrelated rumor about natural disasters was sucked into the by-then wide-ranging conspiracy stew (alongside a separate claim involving a comet).Predictably fake news sites wanted in on the fearmongering as well, claiming Texans were forcibly implanted with microchips and that exercises in the state had claimed one of what would be several civilian casualties. Eventually, the Jade Helm panic became so dramatic it was virtually impossible to tell expressions from genuine conspiracists apart from parodies of them. By August 2015, reports circulated claiming shots had been fired at Camp Shelby (one of the locations at which Jade Helm exercises took place)::Jade Helm has been underway for nearly a month, and so far none of their predictions have come true. The operation has gone largely unnoticed, though news outlets have reported on troop movements and other drills in Texas, Mississippi and other states in recent weeks and a man was arrested last week for allegedly shooting at trainees near Camp Shelby, a short drive from Hattiesburg, Mississippi.Compared to the months-long buildup of conspiracy rumors, the fanfare-free conclusion of Jade Helm 15 on 14 September 2015 was a relative let-down:The exercise will end quietly Tuesday, however. Carried out in parts of Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana and Florida, it will conclude after two months of operations, said Suzanne Nagl, a spokeswoman for Army Special Operations Command, which oversaw it.""At this time, we do not have any lessons learned to share since we have not yet conducted an after-action review of the exercise, but we do believe the exercise overall was a success,"" Nagl said in an email.The military has routinely held training exercises like Jade Helm in the past. But this one took on a life of its own before it even began. An informational meeting attended by citizens and local government officials in Bastrop, Texas, in April generated national attention after several people accused the federal government of preparing for a takeover.:Twitter users expressed opinions about the conspiracy's reach:Public Service Announcement: Jade Helm 15 is officially over.

For example, one Twitter user surmised that CERN was opening up a ""portal"" of astrological proportions, stating obliquely that said portal had to do with an early summer sky show featuring a rare planetary alignment. :The text of the post reads:Be ready for July 5th everyone. That's all I'm saying. Protect your energy. Be alert. Don't do things that lower your vibration, your energy, or your focus. CERN will be opening a portal on July 5th. They began getting it ready when the planets aligned on June 24th. This will beOther posts echoed the same sentiment, including a widely viewed story on the video platform TikTok in which the user claimed the LHC was opening a portal to the future -- all while the theme song to the Netflix science-fiction series ""Stranger Things"" played (its plot line features an alternate dimension). On another video platform, YouTube, another user agreed there was a portal opening; however, in this version ,the portal was to hell. Although it's true, as noted above, that CERN started operating the LHC after an extended period of downtime for upgrades and maintenance, there is no evidence that CERN opened a portal to the future, to hell, or any other dimension other than the current one, or that it opened up a black hole, as some have posited.:In a news release, CERN said the LHC's activities were remarkable on July 5 not for making the plot of ""Stranger Things"" a reality, but for ""recording high-energy collisions at the unprecedented energy of 13.6 TeV.""CERN is a research facility outside Geneva, Switzerland, and on its campus lies the LHC, which is comprised of 17 miles of electro-magnetic tunnel infrastructure, where scientists crash parts of atoms into each other in an effort to make discoveries about the properties of the universe. In 2012 CERN researchers identified the Higgs boson, described by The New York Times as ""a long-sought particle, which imparts mass to all the other particles in the universe.""In its current run, scheduled through 2025, researchers hope to answer some of the universe's big, existential questions, as characterized by the Times: ""Where did the universe come from? Why is it made of matter rather than antimatter? What is the ""dark matter"" that suffuses the cosmos? How does the Higgs particle itself have mass?""Fascinating as this might sound, the LHC has never had a shortage of attention from conspiracy theorists. For example, in 2016 some internet users misappropriated a photographer's image of a storm over Switzerland to falsely claim that CERN opened a portal into another dimension. Another rumor, again spread in 2016, falsely stated that a video depicted a human sacrifice at the facility.:"
581,581,572.RussiaUSElectionsand,"Fake news was a prominent part of the 2016 election cycle, and Americans got a crash course in the ways that foreign powers use propaganda to tamper in elections when the U.S. intelligence community revealed their consensus belief that Russian government hackers interfered in the months leading up to November 2016 to help President Donald Trump secure a victory.  Now, as dribs and drabs of detail about the relationship between Trump's associates and Russian president Vladimir Putin continue to leak and are ballyhooed by the American president as ""fake news,"" it is more important than ever to understand how to separate real news from fanciful fictions.Although the term ""fake news"" has been weaponized for political purposes like attacking the credibility of mainstream news organizations that report stories unpopular with the president and his supporters, it was a term that became popular as the 2016 election cycle wound down and the fact that a Russian-sponsored network of bots, trolls and a hodgepodge of dubious web sites collaborated to disrupt the election and in so doing, shake the trust in the groundwork of American democracy. Now that the political party that controls the levers of power has flipped, the opposition is ripe to be the new purveyors of ""fake news"" and conspiracy theories crafted to drum up mistrust.:During witness testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on 30 March 2017, Clint Watts (a former Federal Bureau of Investigation agent and Foreign Policy Research Institute fellow) called the actions of the Kremlin ""the second Cold War"", and described their international efforts to disrupt the global order that has been in place since the end of World War II:Russian active measures hope to topple democracies through the pursuit of five complementary objectives: One, undermine citizen confidence in democratic governance; two, foment, exacerbate divisive political fissures; three, erode trust between citizens and elected officials and their institutions; four, popularize Russian policy agendas within foreign populations; and five, create general distrust or confusion over information sources by blurring the lines between fact and fiction -- a very pertinent issue today in our country.From these objectives the Kremlin can crumble democracies from the inside out, achieving two key milestones: One, the disillusion of the European Union; and two, the break-up of NATO.The Russians targeted ""any disaffected U.S. audience"" with ""active measures,"" a term that essentially means concentrated campaigns to exploit existing social tensions and divisions with the goal of weakening the country's global standing, allowing Russia more latitude to assert its own interests. Watts described how these efforts were then turned onto the 2016 presidential race -- and made it clear the issue is a bipartisan one, even though the targeting of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign to bolster Trump got the most public attention at the time::Russia's overt media outlets and covert trolls sought to sideline opponents on both sides of the political spectrum with adversarial views towards the Kremlin. They were in full swing during both the Republican and Democratic primary season and may have help sink the hopes of candidates more hostile to Russian interests long before the field narrowed. Senator Rubio, in my opinion you anecdotally suffered from these efforts. ... This past week we observed social media accounts discrediting Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, hoping to further foment unrest inside U.S. democratic institutions. Alina Polyakova, Director of Research on Europe and Eurasia at the Atlantic Council, an international affairs think tank, said the Kremlin is more cynical than ideological in its approach to foreign influence. She told us that under Putin's influence, pragmatism outweighs any coherent set of principles, and Moscow will exploit whichever side of the political spectrum suits their interests in any given context:Given the current political climate, the far right bet is paying off more handsomely than the far left one. If you're sitting in Moscow and looking out into Europe, you want to have allies who are willing to espouse a pro-Russia line -- if they also happen to be nationalists and economic populists and have certain ideas about immigration I don't think it really matters to [the Kremlin]. There is an ideology behind Putinism. It is about an alternative to the Western liberal world view and it aligns nicely with political agendas of far-right parties in Europe.:From that, one can infer that Trump's opponents can easily find themselves acting as unwitting Kremlin tools, especially considering that conspiracy theories are used to attack the existing social order and power establishment. Peter Kreko, a Fulbright scholar from Hungary and a visiting professor of Central Eurasian Studies at Indiana University Bloomington, told us:The main advantage of conspiracy theories as political tools is that they can spread a general anti-establishment sentiment and they can destroy the credibility and trust in all the established leaders and institutions. It's not only an American phenomenon that conspiracy theorists are popping up and operating around anti-establishment candidates.But once those same anti-establishment candidates succeed in getting hold of the reins of power, the same dynamic that secured their victory can easily be turned against them. Kreko compared conspiracy theories as a political tactic to a boomerang, as ""they can hit you back when you are in power."":Because the levers of legislative control were dominated by Democrats for the past 8 years, conspiracy theories were more popular on the right. That will likely change in the coming months and years, with Republicans now controlling all sectors of the U.S. government, he said:This is what some studies already show: That belief in conspiracy theories was strong before the U.S. election in the Republican camp because they felt themselves to be the ones out of power. Usually conspiracy theories are the tools of people who are out of power; they aim to destroy the current institutional setting. After the election there are some indications that Democratic voters believe more conspiracy theories because they target those in power.Indeed, rumors of Trump-Russia collusion have already started dominating the Internet and social media. Examples of the hysteria include a false claim in the days immediately following President Trump's 20 January 2017 inauguration that the Treasury Department was following through on alleged promises made by Trump to President Vladimir Putin to lift Obama-era sanctions placed on Russia after it annexed Crimea, a Black Sea peninsula under the control of Ukraine until 2014.:In another instance, former British MP Louise Mensch tweeted to her 220,000-plus Twitter followers an unproven claim that the protests over the police killing of Mike Brown in Ferguson were funded by Russia. In yet another instance, the blog PalmerReport.org published an unproven claim that a Ukrainian-American businessman was a Trump-Russia conspirator who died under suspicious circumstances. (The man's family told us otherwise.)BuzzFeed News journalist Charlie Warzel was the first to report that the dynamic described by Kreko is indeed playing out in real-time, and in full public view on Twitter. In a 12 February 2017 article, Warzel describes a growing cacophony of self-deputized ""Twitter sleuths"" who spend hours disseminating half-baked notions based on disparate facts drawn from often-unrelated media reports as ""Blue Detectives"":Call it the Alex Jonesification of the left or the rise of the Blue Detectives -- the pure id of a strand of conspiratorial thought of the left and the anti-Trump movement. It's intriguing and eyeroll-inspiring all at once, but for the #resistance crowd it's a mooring force. Most of all, it's an effective messaging tactic: It's designed to go viral, to spark outrage -- and perhaps even action.:If you spend enough time online, you'll see Blue Detectives springing up everywhere. Two weeks ago, Google engineer Yonatan Zunger wrote a post on Medium that went viral. In it, he laid out a succession of ""raw news reports"" suggesting that the haphazard rollout and enforcement of Trump's refugee ban across the country ""was the trial balloon for a coup d'etat against the United States."" In the spirit of Silicon Valley A/B testing ""it gave them useful information,"" he argued. But as some, including Slate, have pointed out, Zunger's post sometimes elides fact in favor of intrigue: His suggestion that the Department of Homeland Security could become a force loyal to the President alone, for example, does not acknowledge that DHS Secretary John Kelly was reportedly unaware of the administration's immigration order until just moments before Trump signed it.On Twitter, especially, the Blue Detectives are increasingly active in theorizing that Trump and his associates are involved in a dizzying multidimensional plot -- and, crucially, are always 10 steps ahead of the American public. Perhaps the most infamous example comes from technology and business strategist Eric Garland's ""game theory"" tweetstorm, which suggests a cunning on the part of the Trump administration and Russia to distract, dodge, and outwit the American public while bolstering its coffers and power. That 127-tweet screed plows through the last few decades of US foreign policy, ultimately arriving at a patriotic but empty conclusion devoid of any compelling revelations about Russia.:Like any poorly-sourced conspiracy theory, this half-baked effort has had consequences. Since the article was published, the movement has only grown, Warzel told us. In a follow-up story, BuzzFeed identified Mensch, a prolific Twitter user, as the ""hub"" of the ""loose, crowdsourced investigation into Russian influence."" Mensch was the subject of a harassment complaint filed with the FBI by Cassandra Fairbanks, an American reporter for the Kremlin-funded Sputnik news agency.So how does one know who to trust in such an environment? Mitchell Orenstein, professor of Russian and Eastern European Studies at the University of Pennsylvania and senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute and Naveed Jamali, a former intelligence operative who worked undercover for the FBI against Russian intelligence, told us that readers should do the opposite of what the Kremlin wants the public to do -- trust institutions and trust professionals. Jamali told us:There's a reason people go to medical school to be doctors -- it's important to remember that. And there's a reason there are professionals. In this case, when you think of investigative journalists, or you think of investigators, they're just going to have access to facts. When there are so many rumors floating around, so many half-truths, these people are held to a standard in terms of how they disclose their findings, and I think it's very different than being a Twitter user. I don't mean that as a slight. Social media's a great marketplace for the exchange of information. But to take hypotheses that you're formulating... I've heard terms like ""citizen journalist"" or ""curators of information"" -- what they're doing is taking articles, some sort of facts, and they're claiming links to them. And look, they may be right -- but they don't have any proof to support it. And that's just not the way investigations work.It's very easy to go on Twitter and follow someone who's constantly curating, or collating, or whatever they call it, to come up with ideas. It's a real temptation. The problem is that the real work that's happening is not visible until it comes out, because there's a whole different standard, and it's slow. I'm very concerned that [what they do] delegitimizes real work.:Malcolm Nance, an intelligence expert and counterterrorism officer with the United States government (and author of a book, published in October 2016, titled ""The Plot to Hack America: How Putin's Cyberspies and WikiLeaks Tried to Steal the 2016 Election"") was even more blunt, saying that laypeople are confusing intelligence with evidence, and thus potentially cherrypicking disparate and unrelated events and weaving them into a narrative without understanding what they don't know:Intelligence isn't evidence -- evidence is a legal term. But we're actually there already! We've got sixteen intelligence agencies that have created the base of evidence for an FBI investigation. This has never happened in the history of America, that a president and his campaign may be working for, or working in collusion, or unwittingly, for foreign intelligence agencies.Orenstein pointed to the work of the country's flagship news publications, who have been aggressively and consistently breaking stories and covering the scandal::I think the reporting from the New York Times andWashington Post has been really solid. They have great experts who really understand the issues. I don't tend to trust many web sites. If I see something on a web site -- does it correspond with what the mainstream media is saying on this?Where the investigation standsRight now, Orenstein described the scandal as an unfinished Pointillism painting: there's a picture emerging of what happened, but many of the details remain unclear. Because of the scope of it, investigations and public disclosure may take a long time:To do a real and legitimate investigation is going to take a long time and that's been frustrating to a lot of people. We're going to have to be concerned about this for a while, and things are going to drip drop out. A lot of us [who are experts in the field] know or think we know this is going to pan out to be a major, major scandal that rivals Watergate and probably will raise questions about impeachment of the president.We have a lot of sources and people we talk to who know more than what's published in the media. For me it feels like a slow motion revelation that we can see three or four steps down the line. But I understand that people experience every little twist and turn along the way -- people don't quite want to believe it or know what to believe. I would just advise people that we are living in a rather fantastical reality and it's going to come crashing down on somebody at some point. ...The most likely scenario here is that there was a lot of money that changed hands. ... I think there's a money part of this and a campaign part of this -- [what we don't know is] what exactly is the linkage between these things? Most likely someone was buying influence in the Trump campaign. It's not really whether it happened, it's exactly how it happened.:Intelligence committee hearings in the House of Representatives and Senate have been on hold as Congress is on recess, but the House Intelligence Committee hearings left on a dramatic note when, on 20 March 2017, FBI Director James Comey publicly announced that the Bureau is investigating alleged Russian election interference:As you know, our practice is not to confirm existence of ongoing investigations, especially those investigations that involve classified matters. But in unusual circumstances where it is in the public interest, it may be appropriate to do so as Justice Department policies recognize. This is one of those circumstances. I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI as part of our counter-intelligence mission is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. And that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts.Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat who serves on the permanent committee, told us the moment gave him chills::Once [Comey] did that, the gravity of what had happened sunk in for people. I think that was an awakening. His confirmation of an ongoing investigation validated the concerns that many people had about coordination between U.S. persons and Russia.The House committee's investigation hit a bump in the road when Chairman Devin Nunes was forced to recuse himself after sharing information with the White House before looping in his fellow committee members -- a move that incurred the wrath of his Democratic counterparts who accused him of being too close to the president to be trusted to lead the investigation. Texas Republican Mike Conway will take his place.Swalwell said the House investigation is back on track. He believes public hearings will soon resume, and hinted that the committee may use its subpoena power to get hold of President Trump's elusive tax returns. Swalwell also told us he has authored a bill that would establish an independent, full-time commission to investigate the Russian intervention. Currently, the bill (entitled the ""Protecting Our Democracy Act"") is stalled in the House, with only one Republican signing on.:Swalwell added that he has hope that a bipartisan desire to secure future elections from the influence of foreign powers will overcome the fear that an investigation threatens the legitimacy of the current administration. He said he was a teenaged intern at the Capitol when the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks took place, and because of that he knows it is possible that lawmakers from both sides of the aisle can unite:I feel the same duty to act as those leaders did back in 2001, and what I fear is that this attack has divided us. In that division we are more vulnerable going into the next election, not just to Russia but also to other countries that have similar capabilities. "
582,582,684.NoHillaryClintonWasn,"Claim:Hillary Clinton was convicted on multiple charges in a military tribunal.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On April 16, 2021, the conspiratorial website Real Raw News reported that former U.S. Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had been convicted by a military tribunal on a multitude of charges including ""charges of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, accessory to murder, child trafficking, endangering a minor, treason, and sedition."":The article is completely fabricated. The falsehoods include the overall claim that Clinton has been on trial in a military tribunal to specific quotes contained in the article attributed to Clinton's long-time aide Huma Abedin and U.S. Navy JAG Corps Vice Admiral John Hannink.The article falsely states that Clinton was sentenced to capital punishment, which would be carried out on April 26, 2021.The U.S. Department of Defense told LeadStories that the story was fabricated. Additionally, Clinton had been making public appearances during the time that she was supposedly being tried. She spoke remotely during an event held by Queens University Belfast on April 15, 2021, for example, and gave another interview on April 13 to Rappler.com. In both cases, she appeared to be speaking from her home.This claim appears to be part of the QAnon conspiracy cult, whose followers believe that various high-profile entertainment and Democratic political figures like Clinton are running a cannibalistic pedophilia ring, and that former U.S. President Donald Trump is secretly machinating behind the scenes to thwart them. :The QAnon conspiracy infamously sets dates for which its adherents expect the villains in the story to be arrested but those dates come and go with no such climactic events.The Real Raw News story folds in several other conspiracy theories known as Clinton Body Bags, which baselessly posits that Clinton's husband, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, has systematically murdered people who hold incriminating evidence about him."
583,583,76.LasVegasShootingRumo,"Claim:We investigated a number of hoaxes, rumors, and conspiracy theories associated with a mass shooting on the Las Vegas strip on 1 October 2017.Rating:MixtureAbout this rating On 1 October 2017, a shooter opened fire on an outdoor country music festival in Las Vegas, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds. As is often the case with major or tragic events, rumors immediately began to flow, even before the shooting ended and the investigation began.:The shooting began just after 10 P.M. local time (or after midnight on 2 October 2017 on the East Coast). Many of the claims circulated during prior mass shootings and reflected ""tropes"" commonly invoked by such events, and others were unique to the incident and circumstances:Was the Islamic State responsible for the Las Vegas massacre?Although outbreaks of violence are frequently attributed to the Islamic State before an initial investigation takes place, a propaganda arm for the group attempted to claim responsibility for the attack. However, investigators quickly ruled out their involvement in the shooting. What about antifa? Did they claim responsibility?No. A Facebook page claiming to be run by antifa operatives in Melbourne, Australia posted and then deleted a status update essentially blaming the massacre on American antifa protesters. However, credible news sources and the group itself pegged the Facebook source as phony before the Las Vegas shooting. :Did eagle-eyed web sleuths unmask the shooter at an anti-Trump rally?Also no. Photographs of a Trump protester circulating on social media do not show the Vegas gunman:A separate screenshot listing off the gunman's purported ""Facebook likes"" circulated on social media, but there was no evidence its claims were accurate or credible::Did a ""mysterious woman"" filter through the crowd, screaming warnings about the shooting forty-five minutes before it happened?Oftentimes, initial compelling rumors continue spreading long after a mundane explanation has emerged. Many social media users heard about an eerie warning spread by a visibly agitated woman nearly an hour prior to the massacre, but far fewer saw that the witness to that purported prediction later walked her claims back significantly.Are there unanswered questions about whether there was a ""second shooter,"" multiple shooters, or from where the bullets were fired?No. The concept of a ""second shooter"" became embedded in American consciousness after the first conspiracy rumors circulated about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. A meme that appeared after this particular mass shooting highlights purported ""inconsistencies"" in the ""narrative"" of the incident, but it does not vary much from the other conspiracy theories that come up after every such incident:::Similar rumors take root in the wake of nearly all mass shootings, but neither investigators nor any evidence has indicated that anyone other than Stephen Paddock fired into the crowd at the concert.Police in Las Vegas specifically and explicitly debunked the claim:The rumor of a second shooter during the mass shooting in Las Vegas ... received so much attention, Las Vegas police addressed it at a [3 October 2017] news conference.""I want to emphasize Paddock is solely responsible for this heinous act. We are aware of the rumors outside of the media and also on social media that there was more than one assailant,"" said Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said.He said, there was no evidence to support the theory of another shooter.:Did CBS fire a lawyer after she made insensitive comments about the tragedy on social media?Yes. CBS attorney Hayley Geftman-Gold was relieved of her duties after a controversy after post-shooting remarks attributed to her were captured and publicized by a blog.Was a stirring personal eyewitness account in circulation on Facebook accurate and legitimate?:A status update was widely shared as a ""silver lining"" after the massacre:Thomas GundersonOctober 2 at 4:48am * I want to say this right now while it's fresh. People PLEASE listen to me! There are bad people in this world, but tonight, I saw every race and gender come together to save lives and protect each other. I had women tie my leg up to stop the bleeding, I had men carrying me on their back to safety and I had many black officers and civilians holding my hand and staying with me every second of the way. Our president is far from perfect, but the divide this country is being created by media and the select few cases that they spread world wide. But you don't get to see the good in people. I'm lying in my hospital bed right now in tears, not because I'm injured but because I did my best to save lives and not once did I see color or gender. Nor did anyone else. My friends, please please take a step back, turn off the tv and go love the person next to you. Black, white, Mexican, straight, gay or anything else. Love on them and show that we are united as one in this country and NO ONE, no matter how hard they try, can't break us! Ever!Its veracity remains unclear at this time.:Did graphic leaked images of the crime scene at Mandalay Bay emerge on social media?On 3 October 2017, a Facebook post appeared featuring purportedly leaked crime scene photographs of the Mandalay Bay room from which the shots were fired::The authenticity of the photographs is unknown, and it is not clear whether they were leaked (versus being taken by a bystander or obtained in a fashion other than surreptitious distribution).Was the shooter one of many mass shooters impacted by the side effects of psychotropic medications?Another claim common in circulation after the Las Vegas massacre was that mass shooters are affected by psychotropic drugs such as benzodiazepines, antidepressants, or anti-psychotic medications::We found no evidence that any of the individuals shown here were credibly suspected to have suffered a psychiatric episode due to reported use of the substance(s).Does a series of photographs depict a brave concertgoer defiantly giving the finger to the shooter?:Undetermined.Is a woman's purported eyewitness account of multiple shooting incidents having been ""scrubbed"" from the web accurate?On 3 October 2017, Facebook user Rikki Raulerson shared the following Facebook status update, the contents of which are unverified:So here goes.... Especially to those of you saying to stop talking about this, stop making assumptions etc.Call me crazy, call me dramatic, call me whatever you want. I'm posting this for those of us who were on the strip Sunday night, who know what we saw and what we were told by police officers, security guards, and even the local news when all of this madness started. And I am posting this in hopes of informing others who have believed everything they've seen on the news. If while leaving the Cosmopolitan, we had been told there was one shooting at the Mandalay Bay, Anthony and I would have not been worried for our lives and we would have continued to go out, knowing we weren't headed to that particular area of the strip. But that's not what we were told. We were told that there were 7 confirmed shooters, and confirmed deaths at multiple hotels. Including Bellagio, the Aria and New York New York. Being told this by a security guard, who then told us to go to the third floor for safety. However, Anthony says, ""No Rikki. This is a very popular hotel, I don't feel like the third floor of this popular hotel in public is the safest place. We're going to try and get out of here right now."" Running back to our hotel next door, Vdara, we are told once again by police/security checking our id and room key, ""yes multiple hotels effected. Go to your room and do not leave."" We then get to the room, immediately turn on the news and start watching out of our windows to figure out what is going on. The news also states, live, that the Bellagio had been effected and there was one confirmed death.:Now... skip ahead about an hour. The news is no longer stating anything about the other hotels effected. They say it is one person. Every bit of info that was being initially given to us was disappearing. We could physically see from our window view, fire alarms going off at the cosmopolitan, and multiple cop cars and ambulances pulling up there as well. We wanted more information about what was happening at these other hotels right next to us, and we weren't getting it. And we still aren't.Monday morning I am of course telling my friends and family about our experience, and I was starting to really feel like I was crazy. Everyone was telling me there was only one shooter, and I just couldn't understand what I had seen. Finally, other people like myself started speaking out. I was relieved to know that I wasn't crazy, but now just as confused as to why the media is trying to hide this information. There are now videos and statements popping up all over the web, showing proof of other shooters and other effected hotels.Why are they trying to hide this?! If for no other reason, think about being a family member of the others who died or were injured at these other hotels. They deserve the respect, and the truth as to what happened to their loved ones.Now, can we please stop talking about Gun Control for just a few minutes, and figure out what is really going on here? Figure out the real motive of this incident, and inform people of the truth. Laws can be put in place for anything and everything. There will always be people who break them. And especially with all of the technology we have now days, it is not very hard to find anything you want. Whether it's an illegal weapon, drugs, anything. Laws will always be broken. So let's stop pretending this incident wouldn't have happened if more laws were in place, but instead demand the truth about what really happened that night, and why? Don't be so naive.:Although this rumor is a variation on the ""second shooter"" claim, it also fails to take into account the difficulties faced by eyewitnesses in identifying the specifics of the shooting as it happened.Due to the close proximity most Vegas casinos share (many are connected to neighboring venues) and the acoustics of the Strip, a barrage of gunfire from one location could easily be mistaken for one from somewhere nearby. Did a 4chan user ""predict"" the Las Vegas mass shooting?Unproven. The post in question was nebulous, and still managed to inaccurately describe the subsequent attack. Although the general location (the Las Vegas strip) fit the prognostication, no other elements were compelling enough to consider the claim credible. Did Michele Bachman say the shooting was avoidable for those who observed the Sabbath and stayed home?:No. Although the meme's origin was unknown, it was one of many satirizing Bachmann's positions. Was a security guard at Mandalay Bay an accomplice to the shooting?No. A disreputable source claimed that Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos was an ""accomplice"" to Las Vegas Strip mass shooter Stephen Paddock, but the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) put paid to the phony story with alacrity.Did a company called ""Crowds On Demand"" put out a call for ""crisis actors"" just before the Las Vegas mass shooting?For the most part, no. Conspiracies swirled arround a Las Vegas Craigslist ad archived on 17 August 2017; date stamps suggest it was published on or around 3 August 2017::On 6 October 2017, Puppet String News claimed:Once again we have a tragic event in America, and just like massive protests across America the Las Vegas shooting had ads for actors on Crowds On Demand back in August before the shooting. Two things seem to pop up after major events take place in America in the last year or so, and that is we get a fucked up investigation and there always seems to be ads for actors before an event like the Las Vegas shooting. So now we have new evidence with crisis actors being looked for on Craigslist and Crowds On Demand a month before the Las Vegas event...I think it's time we launch an investigation into Crowds On Demand don't you?:WorldTruth.tv asserted the same day (in a post riddled with typographical errors) that the suspicious  had conveniently been deleted after the Las Vegas shooting:A California based company called 'Crowds on Demand' placed an advert back in August for 'crisi actors in the Las Vegas area.The adverts, which has since been removed, advertised for protests, Rallies, Audiences, PR Stunts, and Celebrity Events.Crowds on Demand had also placed the same advert on Backstage.com, and as of today, it is still online:Note the wording - ""attending a show/concert"" ... So is it just a coincidence that 6 weeks before the La Vegas shooting farce, we have a notorious company known for hiring crisis actors placing adverts to recruit people as crisis actors for an unspecified event in Las Vegas?However, all Craigslist posts expire automatically after 30 to 45 days. Even going by the latest date the post was archived (19 August 2017) and not the likely date it was posted (3 August 2017), 49 days passed between the date of the post and 6 October 2017 and two months between the posting date and the 1 October 2017 shooting.:Moreover, anti-semitic conspiracy theorists previously set their sights on the same posting -- as part of predictions that bad actors planned chaos for the then-recent Mayweather/McGregor bout. Another post in a general conspiracy forum warned:It's obvious to most that a race war is being pushed. The McGregor/Mayweather fight could be used as a catalyst for such. Mayweather has already planted seeds by calling McGregor racist (even though Floyd referred to Pacquiao as a little yellow monkey).Today an ad was found on Craigslist looking for crisis actors in Vegas. It's been up for two weeks. A friend called, and the dates these ""actors"" are needed is Aug 25th - Aug 27th.Awfully coincidental, eh?Be careful ya'll, remember to let your love and light shine above all else.Even after Vegas shooting conspiracies had begun circulating, forum posters recalled the post as linked to the boxing match. Although there was some confusion, posters for the most part correctly identified the Craigslist post as dated to early August 2017. The  was legitimate, but it was retrofitted to align with false flag theories about the Vegas shooting and its original connotations (fizzled predictions about a ""race war"" at a boxing match) were elided in the retelling. Claims that it ""disappeared"" were down to the fact the page was more than 45 days old at the time it recaptured social media attention. :"
584,584,433.2021inReviewHighligh,"This was supposed to be the year of defining a ""new normal"" -- and, in our opinion, maybe even having a re-do.No such luck. First, we saw a massive misinformation campaign to try to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Never before had we battled such a well-funded effort to try to erode Americans' trust in the democratic process, nor had we seen so many extreme ideas go mainstream from fringe political groups. Heading into the year, we had a sophisticated operation to closely monitor obscure corners of the internet where voter-fraud conspiracies originated.:Yet nothing could have prepared us for Jan. 6, 2021. From cell phone footage supposedly showing Capitol police helping Trump supporters breach the federal building to the former president's comments and whereabouts during the attack, our newsroom scrambled to sort fact from fiction in real time -- and in the months after the historic day.That was all aside from Joe Biden's presidential inauguration, an effort by Democrats to impeach Trump (again), an ongoing civil rights movement to call attention to police brutality, and scaremongering rumors about the effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.

585,585,546.DidtheCDCAdmit98Mill,"Claim:The CDC quietly removed pages from their web site that admitted a link between Simian Virus 40 (SV40), the polio vaccine, and cancer.Rating:MixtureAbout this rating What's TrueA virus that has been found in certain types of cancer in humans was also present in polio vaccines administered in the U.S. at one time.What's FalseNo evidence establishes that anyone ever contracted cancer from a polio vaccination, nor did the CDC 'admit' such had happened or remove pages about the topic from their web site.:Thanks in part to a long-discredited (but deeply entrenched) assertion that the MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) vaccine has been linked to increased rates of autism, fear of vaccination has been rife on blogs and social media groups devoted to the discussion of alternative medicine. A common, uniting element of such rumors is their longevity, due in part to the oft-present claim that the purported ""vaccine truth"" has been covered up or buried by large interests, in particular, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC).In October 2015, many alternative health sites published some variation of a claim the CDC had ""admitted"" that 98 million Americans had over the years been injected with a cancer-causing virus along with their polio vaccine. Then in keeping with the template of the rumor, the CDC supposedly endeavored to immediately eradicate that information from any form of record. Why they ""admitted"" such a thing on the Internet in the first place rather than concealing it entirely is not addressed by the rumors: the CDC of conspiracy theory imagination is always clever enough to do retroactive clean-up in an attempt to cover their tracks but never smart enough to avoid publishing damaging information in the first place. But fortunately a few eagle-eyed folks managed to bust the vast conspiracy via the magic of Google cache::CDC admits 98 million Americans were given cancer virus via the polio shot: https://t.co/7QGE5CY3Ie pic.twitter.com/SrQ5ksEmFJ-- HealthRanger (@HealthRanger) October 28, 2015CDC 'Disappears' Page Linking Polio Vaccines To Cancer-Causing Viruses https://t.co/A0ypmtOFQh-- CaliVaxChoice (@CaliVaxChoice) October 28, 2015On 25 October 2015, Viral Alternative News published an article titled ""CDC admits 98 million Americans were given a cancer causing virus via the polio shot,"" which followed on the heels of a September 2015 article from the web site Vaccines.News headlined ""CDC admits 98 million Americans were given cancer virus via the polio shot"" (credited to a reporter by the name of ""evilnews""), the latter of which cited InvestmentWatch's August 2015 piece titled ""CDC Admits 98 Million Americans Received Polio Vaccine in an 8-Year Span When It Was Contaminated With Cancer Virus""::The CDC has quickly removed a page from their website, which WAS cached here (since removed by Google so you can view an image of the cache here), admitting that more than 98 million Americans received one or more doses of polio vaccine within an 8-year span from 1955-1963 when a proportion of the vaccine was contaminated with a cancer causing polyomavirus called SV40. It has been estimated that 10-30 million Americans could have received an SV40 contaminated dose of the vaccine.First of all, the CDC never ""admitted"" that anyone ever contracted cancer from a polio vaccination. What the CDC actually said was:o Sometime around 1960, Simian Virus 40 (SV40) was discovered in the injected form of the polio vaccine (IPV).o The SV40 virus has been found in certain types of cancer in humans.o Between 1955 and 1963, when some portion of the IPV was contaminated with SV40, roughly 98 million Americans received at least one dose of polio vaccine.:Clearly 98 million Americans were not ""given [a] cancer virus via the polio shot,"" because not every single polio vaccination undertaken between the years of 1955 and 1963 involved vaccine contaminated with SV40: the CDC estimated that somewhere between 10 and 30 million Americans might have received SV40-contaminated vaccine during that period. Moreover, SV40 is not a ""cancer virus,"" and there is no definitive evidence that either SV40 itself or SV40-contaminated polio vaccine causes (or has caused) cancer.But even if the claim about the CDC's hiding evidence of a link between polio vaccine and cancer held water, the short lead-in paragraph quoted above contains a number of credibility-related red flags regarding the CDC's supposedly assuming its role as the perpetual villain of the anti-vaccine movement. America is not the world, and there's no plausible reason to believe that the rest of the planet would be fleeced by one country's public health authorities engaging in a conspiracy to deceive its people about vaccines.Moreover, the claim that the CDC had ""quickly,"" ""quietly,"" or ""recently"" redacted the information about a vaccine-cancer linkage was not new in October 2015, as iterations of it had appeared as early as July 2013. At that time Health Impact News published an article headlined ""CDC 'Disappears' Page Linking Polio Vaccines to Cancer-Causing Viruses,"" and InfoWars' similar ""CDC Sends Fact Sheet Linking Polio Vaccine to Cancer Down the Memory Hole"" story reported::The Center for Disease Control and Prevention website curiously deleted pages admitting that the polio vaccine administered from 1955 to 1963 to over 98 million Americans was contaminated with a primate form of cancer virus.Other CDC web pages also referencing the link between the widely-distributed vaccine and cancer have similarly been discarded.That instance of the rumor claimed the pages had recently been deleted from Google's cache, but the site linked to archived version of the pages in question here and here.The first link was titled ""Cancer, Simian Virus 40 (SV40), and Polio Vaccine Fact Sheet"" and was dated 22 October 2007. If it was (ostensibly) deleted ""quickly"" and ""quietly"" by the CDC as some sort of a cover-up in 2013, that would mean it still sat openly available for viewing by all and sundry online for roughly six years. The second link was titled ""Frequently Asked Questions about Cancer, Simian Virus 40 (SV40), and Polio Vaccine"" and contained such clearly damning ""admissions"" as::All of the evidence to date indicates that after 1963, all vaccines on the U.S. market were free of SV40.The majority of evidence suggests there is no causal relationship between receipt of SV40-contaminated polio vaccine and cancer development; however, some research results in this area are conflicting and more studies are needed. Since the discovery of SV40, several studies have been done to compare cancer rates in groups of individuals known or strongly presumed to have received SV40-contaminated polio vaccine to rates in persons known or strongly presumed not to have received SV40-contaminated vaccine.In summary, the majority of studies in the U.S. and Europe that compare persons known or strongly presumed to have received SV40-contaminated polio vaccine with those known or strongly presumed not to have received SV40-contaminated polio vaccine have not shown a causal relationship between receipt of SV40-contaminated polio vaccine and cancer. It should be noted, however, that SV40 infection has been found in persons who did not receive SV40-contaminated polio vaccine and that for some study participants it cannot be known with certainty whether or not they received SV40-contaminated vaccine. Because of this, there may be errors in these studies that make it harder to detect a true increased cancer risk associated with receipt of SV40-contaminated polio vaccine.:It should be noted that the study of SV40 with respect to cancer and polio vaccines is neither novel nor has in any way been suppressed: as the quoted portion above explained, the concern was identified and addressed prior to 1963. A 2001 study indicated that ""large epidemiologic studies have not identified an elevated cancer risk in persons who received SV40-contaminated vaccines [administered before 1963]"" and found ""no deaths due to tumors of the types putatively associated with SV40."" The findings were described in that research as ""consistent with other negative epidemiologic investigations of risks from SV40-contaminated vaccines,"" although further research was recommended. Research published in 2004 echoed those findings:Although SV40 causes cancer in laboratory animals, substantial epidemiological evidence has accumulated to indicate that SV40 likely does not cause cancer in humans. However, additional laboratory research is needed to better define methods for SV40 detection, as laboratory studies looking for SV40 DNA in human tumors have offered conflicting results. There is also a need to conduct additional studies evaluating cancer patients and controls for antibodies to SV40, which would be present in cancer patients if SV40 causes cancer.:Nonetheless, anti-vaccine blogs and sites continually assert that the CDC has ""admitted"" or covered up information in a manner that relies on a relative lack of context on the part of the reader to spread. In this case, the rumor relied on the reader not knowing that SV40 concerns were well documented in medical literature and long considered resolved. By the same token, redaction conspiracies are primed to circulate in perpetuity each time the CDC is accused of newly ""burying"" information in a manner not immediately verifiable by site visitors (i.e., it's difficult to corroborate information that has purportedly been deleted). But concern over SV40 and vaccines was addressed and dealt with by 1963, 50 years prior to the 2013 outbreak of the rumor. It was hardly an assertion revealed only by alternative health sites' crafty usage of Google caching, and a multitude of studies combed through subsequent cancer rates to identify subsequent elevated risk. None was found, a fact which also was no secret and was long-documented.Moreover, the web documents the CDC was breathlessly accused of deleting were clearly marked ""Last Updated: 22 October 2007,"" while cover-up accusations dated to July 2013. Far likelier than a conspiracy was the fact that the pages were last relevant and useful in October 2007, and they've since been replaced with updated information hosted on separate pages at CDC.gov. In fact, a search for SV40, polio, and cancer on the CDC web site returns a number of related links to CDC pages, inconsistent with claims the CDC has ""disappeared"" such information (rather than replaced it with more current data). The cached pages linked above still lead to dated information on CDC.gov, but none of it meaningfully conflicts with more up-to-date information about long-retired vaccine strains.:"

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. :In March 2020, a video circulated on social media supposedly showing a 5G tower being torn down in China because people feared it was causing the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.The video reached a wider audience on April 1, when actor Woody Harrelson shared it on Instagram::The video does document a real incident in China, however, it was not filmed in 2020 and has nothing to do with the COVID-19 pandemic or 5G (fifth-generation wireless network) towers. As the new coronavirus spread around the globe in 2020, a conspiracy theory holding that it was human-made started to take hold in certain communities. We've examined this claim at length and found no evidence to support it. (Read more about the origins and scientific failings of the ""bioweapon"" conspiracy theory here.) An offshoot of this theory claimed that the coronavirus had actually been caused by 5G cellular towers. 5G was already a ""boogeyman"" in the conspiracy theory community. We've previously addressed a claim that cell tower workers were required to wear hazmat suits while working on 5G equipment (false); another held that Japan was banning the development of 5G over health concerns (false, they are actually investing more in the technology.)In this case, the main piece of ""evidence"" supporting the claim that 5G towers caused COVID-19 is that China started to install 5G towers around the same time that the coronavirus started to spread in the country (around November 2019). While this is true, the mere fact that two things occurred at around the same time doesn't mean they're related (correlation doesn't imply causation). :Although China did start unrolling 5G cell service around the same time that the virus started to spread, this was not the first time that 5G towers were in operation. In fact, 5G networks were in operation in the United States as early as July 2019. South Korea and Germany both had 5G towers installed as early as April 2019. So ask yourself: If 5G towers really caused COVID-19, why weren't cases of the disease reported much earlier in countries such as the United States, South Korea, or Germany?Furthermore, we already know a lot about the true origins of this strain of coronavirus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2).The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.:As for the video displayed above, the footage comes from August 2019 (before the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China) and shows anti-surveillance protesters tearing down a ""smart"" lamppost in Hong Kong.Here's the original video from the Guardian::The Guardian reported:Activists targeted several 'smart' lamp-posts equipped with sensors, cameras and data networks in anti-surveillance protests over the weekend. Protesters, many of whom disguised their identities with masks and umbrellas, fear the devices can be used by China to collect personal information. Authorities insist the lamp-posts only collect air quality, traffic and weather data.In short, this video does not show people in China tearing down a 5G tower in order to stop the spread of COVID-19. It shows protesters in Hong Kong in August 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) tearing down a surveillance tower. "
587,587,584.MarijuanaIsMovingtoS,"Claim:The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) will be reclassifying marijuana as a Schedule 2 drug in August 2016.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In mid-June 2016, rumors began to circulate on social media claiming that the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) would effectively be legalizing marijuana by moving it from Schedule 1 classification (drugs with no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States) to Schedule 2 (drugs that have a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States), which would pot to be used and researched for medical purposes.:A 18 June 2016 article published by the Santa Monica Observer included commentary from an anonymous source said to be a DEA lawyer in which the difference between Schedule 1 and Schedule 2 classifications was explained:The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration will reclassify marijuana as a ""Schedule Two"" drug on August 1, 2016, essentially legalizing medicinal cannabis in all 50 states with a doctor's prescription, said a DEA lawyer with knowledge of the matter.The DEA Lawyer had told the lawyer representing a DEA informant of the DEA's plan to legalize medicinal cannibis nationwide on August 1, 2016. When questioned by our reporter, the DEA lawyer felt compelled to admit the truth to him as well.""Whatever the law may be in California, Arizona or Utah or any other State, because of Federal preemption this will have the effect of making THC products legal with a prescription, in all 50 states,"" the DEA attorney told the Observer. Federal Preemption is a legal doctrine that where the US Government regulates a particular field, State and local laws are overridden and of no effect.He explained that ""there are five DEA schedules. Nothing on Schedule One is ever legal, and that is where Cannabis is today. Schedule Two drugs are available with a prescription."":The article stated that marijuana would be rescheduled alongside ""Percocet, Aderall [sic], Oxycontin, Hydrocodone and other drugs that are legal, even common, with a prescription"" as a Schedule 2 drug. It continued with speculation that California's medical marijuana industry would view the move as unwelcome competition:He opined that the 135 medicinal cannabis clinic owners in Los Angeles will no doubt oppose this move by the Federal government, because the rule change will eliminate any reason for people to visit medical marijuana clinics. ""In my opinion, CVS pharmacy, Rite-Aid and Walgreens will sell Schedule Two THC products similar to what users call ""edibles,"" but will not sell smokeable weed because of the health risk smoking anything entails,"" said the DEA lawyer ... He speculated that this action will be taken in the closing days of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, so as to motivate the Democratic base to turn out and vote for Hillary Clinton[.]The item was popular among residesnts of states without flexible medical marijuana policies, as it suggested that the sale of weed lozenges at CVS was on the horizon, but remarks about the change being election year maneuvering bordered on conspiracy theory. And not everyone was convinced the anonymous source was credible -- a post on the Daily Chronic blog expressed considerable skepticism of the assertion::Shouldn't we be excited? Not quite, as this ""news"" is unlikely to be true. The entire article -- which has since been cited as fact by several pro-cannabis blogs -- is speculation and rumor from a source that is identified only as ""The DEA Lawyer.""According to the second paragraph of the article, ""The DEA Lawyer had told the lawyer representing a DEA informant of the DEA's plan to legalize medicinal cannibis [sic] nationwide on August 1, 2016.""This, the second paragraph of the article, should be as far as anyone needs to read to realize that this article is hastily written, poorly researched, and simply speculation or a rumor, including the misspelling of ""cannabis"" and a poorly worded sentence structure.Throughout the Observer's article, the sole source of this information is only ever referred to as an attorney who wishes to remain anonymous. Reputable journalists rarely use an anonymous source as the sole source of information because they simply can not be properly vetted.According to guidelines issued by the Associated Press (AP), one of the world's largest news organizations, articles must be properly vetted before publication -- including requiring more than one source.:In rare cases, one source will be sufficient - but only when the information comes from an authoritative figure who provides information so detailed that there is no question of its accuracy, according to the AP. For example, a press release issued by the DEA, or a statement from a DEA spokesperson, but not an anonymous attorney acting as the sole source of information.That marijuana-centric outlet decried the swift circulation of the rumor-as-fact across social media and cannabis blogs:[E]ven more reputable sites such as marijuana.com were also fooled, although they took a slightly more cautious approach with their headline, ""DEA Attorney Claims Feds Will Reschedule Marijuana This Summer.""But does this mean that the DEA won't reschedule cannabis? No. In April, the DEA said they were prepared to respond to an administrative petition calling for the reclassification of marijuana, a petition that was launched in 2011. Replying to a July 2015 inquiry by US Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and seven other senators, representatives from the DEA acknowledged that they intend to respond to a five-year-old rescheduling petition, filed by then Governors Christine Gregoire of Washington and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island. The DEA's response is expected by July 1.The DEA last decided on a similar rescheduling petition in 2011. The agency rejected that petition, alleging, ""At this time, the known risks of marijuana use have not been shown to be outweighed by specific benefits in well-controlled clinical trials that scientifically evaluate safety and efficacy."":On 17 June 2016, business site Inc. addressed what such a change might mean for the fledgling cannabis industry, noting that marijuana's rescheduling would subject many businesses to a change in regulation and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversight:If marijuana becomes a Schedule II drug, the FDA would subject companies to intense inspections and testing. Companies would need to get their packaging and labeling approved by the FDA; the Federal Trade Commission would be there to ensure companies don't sink to unfair or deceptive marketing and advertising practices. If marijuana was de-scheduled, and placed into the same category of alcohol and tobacco, it would fall under the purview of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. That has its own maw of legal hoops to maneuver.""If the FDA came out and said we are making cannabis Schedule II and the entire industry didn't change, the whole industry would be illegally trafficking a Schedule II substance,"" says Hank Levy, a CPA for marijuana companies, including Harborside, one of the largest dispensaries in the nation. Simply put, the industry as it stands today would not be legal under a whole set of other laws.""I don't see Schedule II as being any help here for the existing cannabis industry at all,"" says Ittleman, who notes that the changes likely open the door to big pharmaceutical companies that have the experience manufacturing Schedule II controlled substances. ""This is the red carpet for Purdue Pharma and Pfizer to enter the industry,"" adds Ittleman.:The Denver Post (based in Colorado, where marijuana is currently legal for recreational use) ran an editorial surmising that states with laws allowing for broader use of legal cannabis would suffer fiscal losses under a rescheduling of the substance:If the DEA keeps marijuana on Schedule I, the federal government risks continued suffering by those with true medical ailments and continued lack of scientific study. The DEA would be wildly out of step with rapidly changing public opinion. If the DEA de-schedules marijuana, big tobacco companies could take over, and the fears of many anti-marijuana advocates would be realized.Rescheduling marijuana for medical/prescription use, but shutting down the state recreational side, would result in unintended negative consequences. Because prescriptions are not taxed, state and local jurisdictions would lose millions of dollars in tax revenues. Colorado collected nearly $135 million in medical and recreational marijuana taxes and license fees in 2015 on a combined medical and recreational market of nearly $1 billion. With a prescription-only industry, states would lose their current marijuana-related jobs to existing pill-manufacturing companies.:Claims that marijuana would move from Schedule 1 to Schedule 2 on 1 August 2016 initially excited folks in states without laws allowing for medical or recreational use of the substance, but the claims were made by an anonymous source to a small community newspaper.  And in August 2016 the DEA dashed those hopes by announcing they had declined two rescheduling petitions:DEA has denied two petitions to reschedule marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). In response to the petitions, DEA requested a scientific and medical evaluation and scheduling recommendation from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which was conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in consultation with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Based on the legal standards in the CSA, marijuana remains a schedule I controlled substance because it does not meet the criteria for currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, there is a lack of accepted safety for its use under medical supervision, and it has a high potential for abuse.In his letter to the petitioners, DEA Acting Administrator Chuck Rosenberg offered a detailed response outlining the factual and legal basis for the denial of the petitions.:The full responses to the petitions can be found in the Federal Register. Response 1 AND Response 2 The DEA and the FDA continue to believe that scientifically valid and well-controlled clinical trials conducted under investigational new drug (IND) applications are the most appropriate way to conduct research on the medicinal uses of marijuana. Furthermore, DEA and FDA believe that the drug approval process is the most appropriate way to assess whether a product derived from marijuana or its constituents is safe and effective and has an accepted medical use. This pathway allows the FDA the important ability to determine whether a product meets the FDA criteria for safety and effectiveness for approval."

Rating:FalseAbout this rating ContextWagner raised a question about tracking devices in vaccines only in order to debunk allegations made during the course of 67 public statements from a largely anti-vaccine, pro-conspiracy theory group of Orange County citizens.:On April 27, 2021, a clip of Orange County Supervisor Don Wager apparently expressing concern over the existence of ""tracking devices"" in COVID-19 vaccines went viral. The clip showed an exchange between OC Health Care Agency Director Dr. Clayton Chau and Wagner, a Republican representing that county's Third District. ""We heard about an injection of a tracking device,"" Wagner said to Chau, ""Is that being done anywhere?""In response, Chau appeared to chuckle, responding ""I'm sorry, I just have to compose myself. There is not a vaccine with a tracking device embedded in it that I know of that exists in the world. Period."" That moment was shared by former Daily Beast writer Timothy Burke with the caption, ""Republican Don Wagner, who represents three million Orange County residents, wants to know if the Covid vaccine has a tracking device in it""::The clip went viral, and the Daily Beast published a write-up about it, tagging the story with the question ""are you serious?""The answer to that question is no.The video omitted over an hour of relevant context directly preceding Chau's appearance, during which the floor was open for a public discussion of the county's efforts to enter into a contract with a software company to provide documentation of vaccination status. A full 67 people spoke during that discussion period, and nearly all of them made references to a panoply of anti-vaccine or QAnon-adjacent conspiracy theories, with most of their vitriol was directed at Wagner and Chau.For example, one of those constituents claimed in her allotted time that ""the tracking device implanted in my body without my consent is against the Constitution, HIPAA, and the law ... For you to impose your will on this illegal tracking system is underhanded."" This constituent was referencing a baseless conspiracy theory about tracking devices embedded in vaccinations that has been debunked here at Snopes but has been elevated by both anti-vaccine activists and other conspiracy theorists. It is likely this constituent that Wagner was referencing when he declared ""We heard about an injection of a tracking device"" to Chau. :In a statement to The Hill, Wagner asserted that he was walking Chau through the claims made by this group of speakers for the purpose of correcting their claims:At this meeting, speakers made wild charges about vaccine 'passports,' forced vaccinations, travel restrictions, tracking, and that there were microchips in the vaccines. From the dais, I lead Dr. Chau through those charges and to have him debunk them,"" Wagner said.I knew they are not true but [I] wanted the public to hear that directly from Dr. Chau. I got exactly the response from Dr. Chau I expected, with the same laugh at the absurdity of the charges that they deserve. He and I are in regular communication about these public myths, and when they persist for months on end, we work together to dispel them. I am in no way concerned about trackers in the vaccine and Dr. Chau knows this, as he administered my vaccine last month. I continue to encourage everybody to get vaccinated if they can.Indeed, Wagner tweeted a picture of himself receiving a COVID-19 vaccine from Chau on April 3, 2021::Chau also commented on the controversy, confirming that Wagner does not himself believe the claims the two were discussing in the meeting::Because the full context of the Orange County Board of Supervisors meeting made clear that Wagner was repeating baseless assertions of some of his constituents in order for them to be debunked by an expert, the claim that his statements betrayed a serious concern over the possibility of tracking devices in vaccines is properly rated ""False."""

JFK, Jr would be delighted by all this as his ""George"" magazine saw celebrity politics coming. The magazine struggled as it was ahead of its time but now looks prescient. George, of course, played the development pretty lightly, basically for charm and gossip, like People, but what we are dealing with now is dead serious. How does this get handled in the general? Secretary Clinton is not an entertainer, and not a celebrity in the Trump, Kardashian mold; what can she do to offset this? I'm certain the poll-directed insiders are sure things will default to policy as soon as the conventions are over, but I think not. And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.

Wearing a red outfit, his head covered with a hoodie, a mask, and glasses, the first public appearance at a game since his medical emergency sparked numerous online rumors that he was not really there -- rather, according to one conspiracy theory, an individual was standing in for him after the ""real"" Hamlin had died due to the COVID vaccine.:However, that claim was nothing more than a baseless conspiracy theory. The social media posts did not say how, or where, they got their information about Hamlin's purported death and many came from accounts with histories of spreading misleading stories about the effects of COVID-19 vaccines. Furthermore, reputable news outlets, official social media accounts for the Bills and NFL, and the team's coach confirmed the football star attended the Jan. 22 game. For those reasons, we rate this claim ""False."":Many social media posts attempting to ring the alarm on the conspiracy pointed to video footage of Hamlin entering the Jan. 22 game with his head covered. Other videos from the game, including clips from CBS and the NFL, also did not show his face.""[Why] did he never take his ski mask off? WTF is going on here? #bodydouble? [...],"" someone tweeted.:The concept of ""body doubles"" is a popular type of conspiracy theory on the internet that we have debunked numerous times. It often pops up after a famous personality dies or suffers from a medical emergency.As far as the rumors about Hamlin, some social media posts took the theory a step further: Not only did they promote the idea that an individual was supposedly standing in for the real ""Hamlin,"" but they blamed the COVID vaccine for allegedly killing him or making him unresponsive. (We previously addressed unfounded rumors about the vaccine supposedly causing his cardiac arrest.):If, hypothetically speaking, Hamlin had died for any reason, much less because of complications from vaccination, there would be public records documenting his cause and manner of death, and when it supposedly happened. Those files, if they existed, would be eminently newsworthy -- that is, journalists would see them during their routine scans of medical investigators' rosters of recently deceased people and then use their contents to let the public know about Hamlin's purported passing.:Hamlin himself seemingly addressed the theories by tweeting a photo of himself next to a wall mural and doing his signature ""heart"" gesture, with the caption ""Clone.""As far as the Jan. 22 game, the official Buffalo Bills Twitter account posted a video of Hamlin arriving at the stadium, his face still covered, and his mother and brother in attendance, as well. ""Welcome home, @HamlinIsland,"" the tweet read.:He was also seen watching the game from a private room, gesturing to the crowd and making his signature ""heart"" sign with his hands. The NFL tweeted a video of that moment, footage in which Hamlin was not totally visible, in part, due to the game's wintery weather conditions.:From another angle inside that room, the Buffalo Bills' Twitter account showed him standing alongside his brother.Bills coach Sean McDermott told reporters that Hamlin had been coming to the stadium, meeting his teammates, and showing signs of recovery since his cardiac arrest on the field weeks ago. ""It's limited, just overall. But he comes in and really just started really today or yesterday and just trying to get back to a little bit of a routine and just get himself acclimated again and taking it one step, one baby step, at a time here,"" McDermott told reporters. It's unclear why Hamlin seems to have chosen not to show his face in any of the photographs or videos.

And the investigation into Russian meddling into the 2016 election, led by former FBI director Robert Mueller, is actually an investigation into the so-called ""deep state"", where a cabal of evil, money-grubbing globalists, including Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, are responsible for everything from a global pedophile ring to the mass shooting in Las Vegas in 2017.Despite sounding ""crazy,"" the QAnon conspiracy has grown in influence, becoming most obvious to outsiders when supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump began sporting ""Q"" tee shirts en masse at Trump rallies. The Guardian referred to it as a ""volatile mix of Pizzagate, InfoWars and the Satanic Panic of the 1980s, multiplied by the power of the internet and with an extra boost from a handful of conservative celebrities."":Internet users along with disreputable web sites often either fabricate pedophilia claims involving celebrities and prominent Democrats or lump real cases of criminal activity in with the conspiracy, despite lacking evidence of a link. Wysom's case falls into the latter category.The idea that Wysom's case was somehow associated with the #PedoGate conspiracy theory was helped along by followers of media personalities who heavily promoted PizzaGate, such as alt-right social media character Jack Posobiec and Alex Jones's conspiracy network InfoWars, which republished (then deleted) the Ottawa Citizen report:But #PedoGate......that's just a conspiracy, right? ??-- ?IT HAS BEGUN?

592,592,186.DidBillGatesSayHungE,"Claim:Bill Gates said: ""I admit that political polarization may bring it all to an end, we're going to have a hung election and a civil war.""Rating:UnprovenAbout this rating ContextAccording to exclusive reporting from Forbes, Gates said this in September 2022 at the Forbes 400 Philanthropy Summit. To date, we've been unable to locate a full transcript or complete video recording of the event. We reached out to the Forbes writer, the company's corporate communications team, and the summit's organizers with additional questions. We also emailed the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. We will update this story if we receive additional information that might bring a better understanding of this quote and its context.:On Sept. 23, 2022, Forbes.com reported exclusively on several remarks made by Bill Gates at the 2022 Forbes 400 Philanthropy Summit. According to the story, Gates mentioned that ""political polarization"" may bring the future possibility of a ""hung election"" and a ""civil war.""The portion of the story relevant to this fact-check claim read as follows:Gates, who predicted a pandemic back in 2015 and became famous around the world for his views on Covid-19, said he still doesn't have a solution for misinformation and conspiracy theories. He's even had people approach him on the street to yell at him, accusing him of tracking people with microchips.""The polarization and lack of trust is a problem,"" he said. ""One of the best-selling books last year was a book by Robert Kennedy, saying that I like to make money and kill millions of people with vaccines. It's wild that [that] sells well.""Covid-related conspiracy theories appear to be dying down with the receding pandemic: ""I have a group that tracks what's on the web that's talking about things that connect to me,"" he said. ""Overwhelmingly during the pandemic, 95% was all the conspiracy theory stuff. It is calming down now.""But Gates is still worried about domestic polarization in the U.S., which he sees little hope for in the short-term. ""I admit that political polarization may bring it all to an end, we're going to have a hung election and a civil war,"" he said. ""I have no expertise in that, I'm not going to divert my money to that because I wouldn't know how to spend it."":The ""civil war"" quote from the Forbes article led to the publishing of a story by Business Insider titled, ""Bill Gates says political polarization 'may bring it all to an end' and could even lead to a civil war."" We also found two popular YouTube videos that discussed the quote, one from actor and producer Russell Brand, and another from podcaster Tim Pool's Timcast IRL. The video titles were, ""Hang On, Bill Gates Just Predicted WHAT?"" and ""Bill Gates Says CIVIL WAR Is Coming, Election Will Be HUNG.""As of this writing, we were in the process of attempting to locate a full transcript and potentially a complete video of Gates' answers at the event. A partial video of Gates' appearance was uploaded to the Forbes Facebook page, but did not include the remark in question. We contacted the writer of the Forbes article to ask if notes were available. We also reached out to the company's corporate communications team, the summit's organizers, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This story will be updated if we receive any further information.For further reading, we previously reported on various baseless conspiracy theories associated with Gates, some of which he discussed in the interview. For example, he once tweeted a joke about a conspiracy theory that made a false claim about COVID-19 vaccines and microchip tracking. Another debunked rumor said that he owned a majority of U.S. farmland. Among a number of other strange conspiracy theories, we also reported that, no, Gates never ""admitted"" that vaccinations are the ""best way to depopulate"" the planet.:"

The tablet looks surprisingly like a modern phone, with the 12 keys, a display and a 'talk' button. Could these extraterrestrials have tried to introduce the Sumerians to a phone-like communications device, only to find they weren't ready for it and dialed them back to a stylus and clay tablets?While the theory that the this cellphone was created by the alien race Anunnaki from the planet Nibiru in order to introduce the Sumerian civilization to modern technology is interesting, this ""alien cellphone"" was actually created by a German sculptor and is only a few years old.Karin and Karl Weingartner of the Art Replik Studio created the clay tablet in January 2012. While the photo was originally shared with a description similar to the one published by Mysterious Universe (Art Replik never mentioned aliens) there are several indications that this post was simply a joke, such as the title of the object (""BablyoNokia""), comments on the photogrAPH (""Yes, exactly!"" in response to ""is that my old phone?""), and the fact that the image was watermarked art-replik.com.:The ""alien phone"" was created in jest and was likely used as a marketing tool:The above-displayed ""ancient cellphone"" was not discovered by a group of archaeologists in Austria and it was not left behind by aliens. It was created by a German sculptor who specializes in making replicas of ancient art.:"
594,594,430.DidSnopescomIgnoreaH,"Claim:Snopes.com ignored reports of a large child trafficking ring bust in Arizona.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 7 June 2018, Neon Nettle -- a web site that frequently weaves nonsensical allegations into its stories -- pushed out a disingenuous article maintaining that we had ""ignored"" a huge child trafficking bust:Snopes has 'debunked' recent allegations of a child trafficking camp made by veterans even though it has been reported that the FBI has rescued 60 children as part of a massive pedophile ring bust.The fact-checking site said that the story about the discovery of an Arizona child trafficking camp was completely ""false"" with all references to it on social media hidden.The sting saw 150 child traffickers snared along with approximately 160 children rescued, some as young as 3 years old.""They are crimes of special concern to the FBI and to law enforcement generally,"" [FBI special agent Matt] Alcoke said. ""Because the victims are so vulnerable as children and because the offenders could be from just about any walk of life, from a gang member all the way up to someone who is highly successful and wealthy."":This passage reproduced an accurate quote from a real FBI agent speaking about a legitimate trafficking bust -- but that bust was part of an FBI sting operation which took place in Atlanta, 1,700 miles away from the site of the debunked ""child trafficking camp"" in Tucson. Neon Nettle deliberately and misleadingly conflated these two stories to make is seem as if we were disclaiming a successful child trafficking raid in Georgia rather than debunking a false report of child trafficking in Arizona.The FBI sting in Atlanta, code-named Operation Safe Summer, was specific to the state of Georgia and had nothing to do with the false report of a ""child trafficking bunker"" allegedly discovered by a group in Arizona:NORTH FULTON COUNTY, GA. -- A sting on the sex-trafficking trade in metro Atlanta netted dozens of arrests and the rescue of dozens of children forced into sexual servitude, the FBI announced this week.Operation Safe Summer was a collaborative effort between the FBI's Atlanta field office and 38 law enforcement agencies in six metro counties, assistant Special Agent in Charge Matt Alcoke told Channel 2's Mike Petchenik.:The Neon Nettle story was apparently sourced from fellow conspiracy theorists The Free Thought Project, who engaged in similar deceptive headlining:As Snopes 'Debunks' Child Trafficking Camp, 160 Kids as Young as 3 Rescued in GeorgiaAfter Snopes called allegations of child trafficking made by a veterans group a 'conspiracy theory', 160 children, as young as 3-years-old, were rescued from traffickers in Georgia.Free Thought Project insinuated, in an impressive combination of logical fallacies, that because we (and others) debunked the false ""pedophilia bunker"" in Arizona story, we must not believe child trafficking exists anywhere in the world at all:Snopes -- whether deliberately or not -- is actively engaging in censorship of content that could actually help children by engaging others and fostering discussion. Instead of allowing the discussion to continue, Snopes deliberately shut down the conversation, insuring that the very important topic of child trafficking is forced into the memory hole and never heard of again.As the above case illustrates, child trafficking is a horrifying reality. While Pizzagate scenarios may not be real, there are far worse incidents taking place across the country.:Child trafficking is, indeed, a horrifying reality, which is why we choose to cover it responsibly rather than making the job of law enforcement and advocacy groups immeasurably more difficult by irresponsibly propagating false information about child trafficking (as sites such as Neon Nettle and the Free Thought Project do).For example, the ""veterans' group"" that stumbled across the abandoned homeless camp on private property in Tucson decided that the presence of child's toys at one end of the camp and pornographic magazines elsewhere was obvious evidence of child sex trafficking, rather than ordinary detritus left behind at a temporary site where those migrating from one region to another chose to stop for a while and perhaps have a moment or two alone to tend to some rather common needs.That group also decided (again, without any evidence) that straps tied around trees were ""restraints"" for holding children in bondage, rather than for some other more prosaic use, such as tying up tarps to provide shade from the relentless Arizona sun. When local and federal authorities investigated the site and found nothing but an abandoned homeless encampment, the same ""veteran's group"" immediately accused law enforcement of orchestrating a massive cover-up.:The Polaris Project provides information on recognizing genuine signs of human trafficking and responsibly reporting it. We recommend them as a resource, rather than clickbait-driven, irresponsible purveyors of misinformation."
595,595,101.ThatTimeFoxNewsRetra,"On 23 May 2017, Fox News removed a discredited article from their web site suggesting that Seth Rich, a 27-year-old employee of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) who had been shot to death the year before in Washington, D.C., had leaked thousands of DNC e-mails to the WikiLeaks web site before he died.The article was replaced by a statement that read:On May 16, a story was posted on the Fox News website on the investigation into the 2016 murder of DNC Staffer Seth Rich. The article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting. Upon appropriate review, the article was found not to meet those standards and has since been removed.We will continue to investigate this story and will provide updates as warranted.A year has passed since that notice went up, so it seemed an apt time for us to look back at the genesis of the story, how and why it came to be retracted, and what Fox News has had to say about it since. The best place to start is with the known facts about the murder.:Seth Rich was found dead approximately one block from his Washington, D.C., apartment just before dawn on 10 July 2016. He had been shot twice. Rich was walking home from a local bar while speaking on the phone to his girlfriend, who later reported hearing voices and gunshots before his phone went silent. Bruises on his hands and face indicated that a struggle had taken place.No suspects were ever arrested in what the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPDC) theorized was a botched robbery attempt (even though none of Rich's possessions appeared to have been stolen), and the case remains unsolved to this day.Seth Rich's death became the focal point of a baseless conspiracy theory holding that Rich leaked tens of thousands of DNC e-mails to WikiLeaks and was targeted for ""assassination"" after the notorious site published them online.Rumors to that effect erupted within days of the shooting and were enthusiastically promoted by right-wing web sites and social media influencers noteworthy for their support of GOP presidential candidate Donald J. Trump (WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and Trump campaign surrogates Roger Stone and Newt Gingrich, to name three prominent examples).:As the Washington Post and other mainstream news venues quickly pointed out, however, U.S. intelligence agencies had already singled out Russian hackers as the perpetrators of the e-mail leaks, not a DNC insider. That, plus the utter dearth of evidence linking Rich to the hacked e-mails, WikiLeaks, or Assange (despite sly hints from the latter that Rich may have been the source), effectively put a lid on the conspiracist rumblings, which were relegated to lesser-known hyperpartisan blogs and discussion groups as the months wore on.But 2017 saw a resurgence of the Seth Rich conspiracy theory thanks to a Fox 5 DC (WTTG-TV) report on 15 May (bylined Marina Marraco) suggesting that hard evidence existed showing Rich had been in direct communication with WikiLeaks:Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death. Wheeler's services were offered to the family and paid for by a third party, according to a statement issued by the Rich family Tuesday which also includes that ""the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family."":Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich's murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation.""The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,"" said Wheeler. ""They haven't been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both.""When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said, ""Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.""The story had serious problems, however. For one, Wheeler was quoted as saying a police source confided to him that the department was told to ""stand down"" from investigating the case -- an assertion the MPDC flatly denied. For another, Rich's family issued a statement dismissing Wheeler's claims as unsubstantiated and saying the private detective wasn't authorized to speak to the press::We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth's murderers. The services of the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.The story fell apart completely when Wheeler contradicted himself in statements to other news outlets. He told CNN's Oliver Darcy, for example, he learned of supposed evidence that Rich had been in contact with WikiLeaks from the news media, not from an FBI informant:Wheeler instead said he only learned about the possible existence of such evidence through the reporter he spoke to for the FoxNews.com story. He explained that the comments he made to WTTG-TV were intended to simply preview Fox News' Tuesday story. The WTTG-TV news director did not respond to multiple requests for comment.""I only got that [information] from the reporter at Fox News,"" Wheeler told CNN.Asked about a quote attributed to him in the Fox News story in which he said his ""investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of e-mail exchange between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,"" Wheeler said he was referring to information that had already been reported in the media.:Specifically, Wheeler said in a 16 May interview with BuzzFeed, he had learned about the e-mails while being interviewed by Fox News reporter Malia Zimmerman, whose article alleging Rich was in contact with WikiLeaks was posted on FoxNews.com that same day.For her part, Zimmerman attributed the revelation to an unnamed ""federal investigator"":The Democratic National Committee staffer who was gunned down on July 10 on a Washington, D.C., street last July just steps from his home had leaked thousands of internal emails to WikiLeaks, law enforcement sources told Fox News.A federal investigator who reviewed an FBI forensic report detailing the contents of DNC staffer Seth Rich's computer generated within 96 hours after his murder, said Rich made contact with Wikileaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time.""I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,"" the federal investigator told Fox News, confirming the MacFadyen connection. He said the emails are in possession of the FBI, while the stalled case is in the hands of the Washington Police Department.The revelation is consistent with the findings of Rod Wheeler, a former DC homicide detective and Fox News contributor and whose private investigation firm was hired by Rich's family to probe the case. Rich was shot from behind in the wee hours, but was not robbed.:Wheeler told other news outlets he had been misquoted and in fact had no direct evidence or personal knowledge of communications between Rich and WikiLeaks. He first learned of the alleged e-mails, he said, from Zimmerman herself.CNN reported, moreover, that according to law enforcement officials the information did not come from the FBI, which neither had possession of Seth Rich's laptop nor had conducted a forensic examination of its contents. Six days later, FoxNews.com retracted Zimmerman's article and substituted a statement (quoted at the top of this page) saying the piece didn't pass editorial muster. Fox 5 DC, instead of deleting their version of the story, simply added a preamble noting Wheeler had ""backtracked"" on his claim that he had sources at the FBI who confirmed contacts between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks.Even as the Seth Rich story was crumbling, pro-Trump Fox New Channel commentator Sean Hannity latched onto the conspiracy theory and continued promoting it on his nightly broadcasts and Twitter, calling on Congress to investigate the murder::Congress, investigate Seth Rich Murder! @JulianAssange made comments u need to listen to! If Seth was wiki source, no Trump/Russia collusion https://t.co/QPHZwypU34-- Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) May 22, 2017Hannity finally relented -- sort of -- on 23 May 2017, after Rich's brother sent a letter to the commentator and his executive producer begging them not to ""drag our family name through the mud"" with ""baseless accusations."" That night, Hannity said on his program that he would no longer discuss the matter ""for now"" out of respect for the family's wishes, then tweeted the following hours later:Ok TO BE CLEAR, I am closer to the TRUTH than ever. Not only am I not stopping, I am working harder. Updates when available. Stay tuned!-- Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) May 24, 2017:Fox News would not publicly comment on the matter again until more than two months later, on 2 August 2017, when private investigator Rod Wheeler sued the network, reporter Malia Zimmerman, and sometime Fox contributor Ed Butowsky (who allegedly financed Wheeler's investigation), alleging they had fabricated quotes and ""created fake news to advance President Trump's agenda."" The complaint said the Trump administration not only approved the story but was involved in its creation.White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders denied any White House involvement, and Fox News President Jay Wallace issued a statement denying the rest of the lawsuit's claims:The accusation that FoxNews.com published Malia Zimmerman's story to help detract from coverage of the Russia collusion issue is completely erroneous. The retraction of this story is still being investigated internally and we have no evidence that Rod Wheeler was misquoted by Zimmerman. Additionally, Fox News vehemently denies the race discrimination claims in the lawsuit -- the dispute between Zimmerman and Rod Wheeler has nothing to do with race.:Fox News employees interviewed by CNN's Oliver Darcy expressed puzzlement over the lack of disciplinary (or exculpatory) action in connection with the botched story despite an ongoing internal investigation. The inaction was ""classic Fox,"" in the words of one Fox staffer quoted by Darcy. ""No one ever gets fired from Fox for publishing a story that isn't true,"" the senior employee maintained.Another lawsuit followed in March 2018, this time filed by Seth Rich's parents, Joel and Mary Rich, against the same three defendants. Their complaint alleged that the false narrative Fox News promoted about about their son made the Riches ""collateral damage in a political war to which they are innocent bystanders."" The network responded by filing a motion to dismiss on several grounds, including the plaintiffs' failure to plead ""outrageous or extreme conduct"" on the part of Fox News or state a claim for ""intentional infliction of emotional distress.""The network did not issue a statement to the press, citing the pending litigation.Indeed, Fox News has neither commented nor issued updates on the Seth Rich story or its aftermath since August 2017, a fact duly noted in a tweet by Oliver Darcy on the one-year anniversary of the story's publication::One year ago today, Fox News retracted its Seth Rich story & said it would investigate the matter.Thus far, there has been no disciplinary action announced or update on how it got published. When I asked about its status, a Fox spox declined comment.. https://t.co/hP5jL6Iu14 pic.twitter.com/kYds3oybfU-- Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) May 23, 2018We reached out to Fox News for a response to Darcy's comments and any other information they might care to share about the retracted article and their internal investigation.Citing pending litigation, Fox declined to comment."

His former Attorney General, Eric Holder, told reporters that Barack Obama is ""ready to roll"" with the newly-formed National Democratic Redistricting Committee, an organization Holder chairs, to address what they term a ""massive structural disadvantage"" Democrats currently experience in Congress due to electoral district gerrymandering.:"

Many reputable publications reported on McConnell's fall and subsequent hospitalization, including The Associated Press (AP), The Washington Post, NBC News, and The Wall Street Journal. If the concussion had been fatal like the social media posts allege, news of his death would appear in those stories, as well as receive separate coverage.

That statement read:Leader McConnell tripped at a dinner event Wednesday evening and has been admitted to the hospital and is being treated for a concussion. He is expected to remain in the hospital for a few days of observation and treatment. The Leader is grateful to the medical professionals for their care and to his colleagues for their warm wishes.On March 13, it was reported that McConnell had been discharged from the hospital and would complete inpatient physical therapy before being able to return home. On March 25, it was reported he had left therapy and returned home.We reached out to Popp directly for more details on McConnell's condition. We will update this report when, or if, we get a response.:Some posts reporting on McConnell's fictitious death were rooted in humor and not taken seriously.

The essay attributed to O'Reilly amplifies a widely debunked conspiracy theory that posits the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is the result of a human-made bioweapon as opposed to a new, naturally occurring virus. It reads, in part: The communist regime has millions of its own citizens slaving in gulags simply for speaking against the government or openly practicing Christianity. Knowing they could not attack us openly they needed to be coy, like a deceptive fox. In my opinion, I believe the regime released a biological weapon upon the world that doesn't kill everyone, but kills ""enough,"" especially the elderly and in-firmed.

Readers reported spotting the essay on Facebook and also in forwarded emails. But it was not posted by O'Reilly on his website or his social media accounts. We also found no evidence via other news sources that O'Reilly promoted the debunked conspiracy theory that the COVID-19 pandemic was an act of biological warfare by the Chinese government.In point of fact, the essay's true author appears to be a Facebook user named Tim Besmer Sr., who posted it to his page on April 2 with a copyright notice in his own name and the words ""Permission given for public sharing"" appended. At that time, the post was labeled ""False"" by Facebook's independent fact-checking partners.We have not been able to ascertain who added O'Reilly's byline to the essay, but within days of its initial posting a version appeared containing both Besmer's name and O'Reilly's, followed by variants attributed to O'Reilly alone.In a statement to Snopes, a representative for O'Reilly's website confirmed that ""Bill O'Reilly did not write a single word of the essay in question,"" adding that the pundit ""does not traffic in conspiracy theories."":We therefore rate this quoted item ""Misattributed."""

A fellow prisoner, John Denham, confirmed to the inquest that inmates at HMP Bristol took contracts on King.Prison workers were called to Kings prison cell to at 9:20 pm on January 21 to find King unconscious with his penis chopped off.:This article was based on a real incident that took place in January 2016, involving the prison death of one of several men (James King, originally named Robin Hollyson) convicted as part of a ""paedophile gang"" that sexually abused young children:Seven members of a paedophile gang were involved in the rape and abuse of babies, toddlers and children in attacks that were streamed on the internet and seen on every continent.The sex ring - described as having ""tentacles that go round the world"" - preyed on the families of the children they targeted, in one case grooming a mother and father before their baby was born.Members would frequently travel long distances to carry out the attacks together or watch the abuse over the internet, often using the dark web, if only one of them had access to a victim. Online chat revealed that members of the gang, who lived across the UK, would offer advice and guidance to others on drugging their young victims.Seven men, aged between 30 and 51 and including three convicted sex offenders, were brought to justice following an investigation led by the National Crime Agency.:The details can be reported in full for the first time after the trial of two of them, John Denham, 49, and Matthew Stansfield, 34, concluded at Bristol crown court with their convictions. Denham was found guilty of conspiracy to sexually assault a child under 13. Stansfield was convicted of two charges of conspiracy to rape a child under 13.The others - Robin Hollyson, 30; Christopher Knight, 35; Adam Toms, 33; David Harsley, 51, and Matthew Lisk, 32 - pleaded guilty earlier to the charges they faced.Hollyson, who was previously known as Robin Fallick, Stansfield and Harsley are convicted sex offenders while Denham, who changed his name from Benjamin Harrop, was a respected youth football coach.In total they faced more than 30 charges, including the rape of a child, conspiracy to rape a child, sexual activity with a child and administering a substance with intent against three victims - a baby, a toddler and a pre-school-age child. Investigators, who spoke before the verdicts, believe there are other victims.According to other news reports, some of King's fellow inmates admitted to plotting to do him physical harm at the facility where they were imprisoned::Prisoner John Denham told an inquest that fellow inmates at HMP Bristol quickly took out contracts on King to burn him or give him a ""black eye or two"".King's mother Deborah Wyatt added that a fellow gang member had been ""sugared"" - burned with sugar-filled water - in an attack he feared was intended for him.In a statement to police, Denham said people had taken contracts out on King inside prison to hurt him.However, the most salacious element of Neon Nettle's reporting, that James King was ""found dead in his prison cell with his penis chopped off,"" was entirely fabricated by that web site.  In fact, King was found hanging unconscious in his cell (and died of his injuries two days later), after which an inquest heard medical and other forms of evidence sufficient to support a conclusion of suicide.  No legitimate news reporting stated that King had been murdered by other inmates or found with his penis ""chopped off""::Just four months into his sentence he was found hanging in his cell and died two days later in hospital on January 17.A four-day inquest before a jury at Flax Bourton, near Bristol, heard how King had anxiety and depression, which got worse around the time of his sentencing.He had tried to kill himself before arriving at Bristol prison and was three times placed on special observation amid fears he would harm himself or commit suicide.Prison officer Mike Simmonds said there was ""a lot of suspicion"" because his cellmate Cona Ellis was found covered in blood and wearing King's watch.But when forensic officers examined the cell and found two suicide notes police decided there was ""no foul play"", it was said.Pathologist Amanda Jeffery said King died as a result of lack of oxygen to the brain caused by hanging.After more than four hours of deliberation the jury of ten people returned a conclusion of suicide.None of this misreporting was surprising, as Neon Nettle is a fake news site particularly known for publishing fabricated and exaggerated clickbait stories about pedophiles.:"

On April 26, 2020, Rudy Giuliani, a former New York City mayor and a staunch ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, purportedly tweeted to criticize the Obama administration for supposedly having given ""$3.7 million to the Wuhab lab in China"" in 2017 -- the site where the COVID-19 coronavirus originated, according to unfounded rumor, or ""was created,"" according to conspiracy theory.Some critics were quick to point out that former President Barack Obama was only president for less than three weeks in 2017, as Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States on Jan. 20, 2017, so Giuliani was effectively criticizing Trump himself::The above screenshot did reproduce a real tweet from Giuliani. And given that U.S. government funding is typically proposed, approved, budgeted, and appropriated long before it is actually disbursed, Giuliani's reference to the year 2017 wasn't necessarily as much of a gaffe as it might have superficially appeared. The former mayor still managed to get plenty wrong in a single tweet, however.As we noted in a previous article here on Snopes.com, the referenced $3.7 million comprised a series of multiple grants for coronavirus research issued by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases over the course of several years to different entities, of which the Wuhan Institute of Virology was just one:Between 2014 and 2019, the EcoHealth Alliance was awarded a series of grants totaling approximately $3.7 million by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (a division of the National Institutes of Health) to study the ""risk of future coronavirus (CoV) emergence from wildlife using in-depth field investigations across the human-wildlife interface in China."" Only a portion of this money has been used to fund research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, however, and approximately $700,000 of this grant money was awarded under the Trump administration.Under award number NIAID R01AI110964, NIH also funded studies produced by institutions in the United States, Australia, and Singapore, and the work involving the Wuhan Institute of Virology was an international collaboration with the New York-based EcoHealth Alliance.While these funds were originally appropriated by the NIH in 2014 during the Obama administration, the most recent payment, in 2019, was authorized by the Trump administration.:Furthermore, such grants were not ""prohibited"" in 2014. As noted above, the grants questioned by Giuliani were to study the ""risk of future coronavirus (CoV) emergence from wildlife."" Back in October 2014, the U.S. had placed a funding moratorium on one specific type of research, gain-of-function (GOF) studies that have ""the potential to enhance the pathogenicity or transmissibility of potential pandemic pathogens"" and had ""raised biosafety and biosecurity concerns, including the potential dual use risks associated with the misuse of the information or products resulting from such research"":Concerns over so-called ""gain-of-function"" (GOF) studies that make pathogens more potent or likely to spread in people erupted in 2011, when [virologist Yoshihiro] Kawaoka's team and Ron Fouchier's lab at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, announced that they had modified the H5N1 bird flu virus to enable it to spread between ferrets. Such studies could help experts prepare for pandemics, but pose risks if the souped-up pathogen escapes the lab. After a long discussion, the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) decided the two studies should be published and federal officials issued new oversight rules for certain H5N1 studies.But U.S. officials grew uneasy after the publication of new GOF papers and several accidents in U.S. biocontainment labs. In October 2014, they announced an unprecedented ""pause"" on funding for 21 GOF studies of influenza, MERS, and severe acute respiratory syndrome viruses. NIH eventually exempted some studies found to pose relatively little risk. But eight influenza studies and three MERS projects remained on hold.:The coronavirus research funded between 2014 and 2019 via the grants referenced by Giuliani did not encompass gain-of-function studies and was therefore not ""prohibited."" (The gain-of-function funding moratorium was finally lifted in December 2017.)New York's former mayor was correct in noting that the Wuhan Institute of Virology did receive some research funding via grants from the NIH, but he erred in all the other details stated or implied in his tweet."

Meanwhile, anti-vaccine groups accelerated their sensational and often factually vulnerable campaigns to try to stop the remaining population from accepting the shots.Those efforts often repeated unfounded conspiracy theories that COVID-19 vaccine administrators were secretly inoculating people with miniature devices to actively track their locations or to connect 5G broadband cellular networks. For example, as of this writing, social media users were circulating a handful of videos allegedly showing magnets sticking to vaccine patients' arms, which some framed as evidence of the ""microchip"" scheme.For example, one viral video (a screenshot of which is displayed below) showed a woman in a tank top placing an item about the size of a coin on her upper left bicep to purportedly reveal an under-skin magnetic force.""WE'RE CHIPPED AND WE'RE ALL FUCKED!"" a Facebook caption read. ""Magnet appears to stick to embedded chip following shot.""::Other footage -- including a TikTok video supposedly featuring a ""Baby Yoda"" (aka ""Grogu"") magnet sticking to a vaccine recipient's arm -- circulated widely around the same time. TikTok eventually removed that clip, and other social media sites such as Instagram and Facebook placed content warnings on similar videos to avoid confusing people about the real effects of the innoculations.The underlying claim was false. Regardless of the brand (such as Pfizer, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson), no COVID-19 vaccine contains radio-frequency identification chips or other types of magnetic devices as part of a nefarious plan to implant people with technology against their will. That said, below, we lay out what likely happened in the videos ostensibly showing magnets stuck on people's arms.First, though, we reached out to the apparent creator of the video featuring the Baby Yoda magnet, as well as several other social media accounts that promoted the theory, to learn their motivations for sharing the content. We have not received any responses yet, but we will update this report when, or if, that changes.In other words, we did not have the answers to questions regarding the alleged magnets in the videos. Specifically, were they actually little items made of materials such as iron, steel, nickel that attracted other magnets? It was unknown.:It is also worth mentioning that no proof was offered in the videos that the objects were magnets or that the people depicted had actually received a COVID-19 vaccine.Next, we considered a hypothetical: What would human skin do, or look like, if a magnetic object existed underneath it?Reuters published the below-displayed photograph in 2011 showing the force of a magnet lifting the skin of someone who had a metallic object inside them. Dr. Robert Brodell, who co-authored a study exploring the question at the time, described the image as the skin creating a ""tent"" upward toward the magnet.:No one depicted in the popular videos about COVID-19 vaccines seemingly had their skin ""tent"" like the above-displayed photograph -- at least based on the angles from which those clips were recorded.Next, we considered another theoretical scenario based on the conspiracy theory's premise. If the shots included metallic ingredients to create a magnetic pull, wouldn't people who are allergic to those materials endure physical reactions, such as itchy, blistering, or dry skin?According to a study of metal allergies published in the National Library of Medicine, scientists estimated that up to 17% of all women and 3% of men are allergic to nickel, while a smaller percentage is allergic to cobalt and chromium.Based on those estimates -- and if, hypothetically speaking, the vaccines included metallic ingredients -- a sizable proportion of vaccine recipients would report rashes or skin irritations. That, however, was not the case, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) list of common possible side effects.:Lastly, to fully substantiate our conclusion, we considered the ingredients of COVID-19 vaccines, which are listed and approved by the Federal Drug Administration (Pfizer here, Moderna here, and Johnson & Johnson here. Also, here's a helpful explainer of the Pfizer vaccine's ingredients by MIT Technology Review, as well as a breakdown by the New Jersey-based Hackensack Meridian Health.)We and experts concluded no COVID-19 vaccine formulas included metal ingredients or any amount of biological material required to do what the videos alleged. For example, Edward Hutchinson, a lecturer with the Centre for Virus Research at Scotland's University of Glasgow, told us via email:""[You] would need to introduce a large lump of magnetic material beneath the skin to get the action through the skin that the videos claim to show (if you want to give this a go, try getting a fridge magnet to pick up anything, particularly tiny bits of metal, through the skin between your thumb and index finger).""Furthermore, Al Edwards, an associate professor in biomedical technology from the University of Reading in England, said the human body is comprised of the same type of biological materials in the vaccine formulas. :""There is nothing magnetic in vaccine formulations, most of what is injected is extremely pure water, plus some simple salts to make the injection less painful, and an absolutely tiny amount of vaccine,"" he wrote Snopes. ""Most food is made of similar molecules, and eating food doesn't make people magnetic.""In sum, while the videos did not depict authentic effects of COVID-19 vaccines, the reasons for why the alleged ""magnets"" seemingly stayed on people's arms were unclear. More plausible than the microchip conspiracy theory were the possibilities that people positioned their arms in away to avoid the items' gravitational pull downwards or used items that stuck to people's skin for reasons other than a magnetic pull. For those reasons, we rate this claim ""False."""
602,602,173.IsThisaYoungWomanwit,"Claim:A photograph shows a young woman flying with President Bill Clinton to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's island in the latter's plane.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Who is the woman in a viral photo with former President Bill Clinton? She's a photographer and co-founder of a New York-based modeling agency. But if you pose that question to adherents of a Qanon conspiracy theory, you'll probably get a different answer: She's an associate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and recruits children to come to the billionaire's island.:So how did this ordinary citizen get mixed up in the world of Q? It started with a single miscaptioned photograph that supposedly showed her on Epstein's private plane with Clinton::While this appears to be a genuine, unaltered photograph, the conspiracy theorists spreading it get several things wrong about what it shows. Mainly, the photograph wasn't taken on a plane owned by Epstein, who was charged with new sex crimes related to child-sex-trafficking for prostitution in the summer of 2019. Before we go any further, we should note that the Q conspiracy theory is built on speculation and wild assumptions. The woman has not been implicated in any legal proceedings related to Epstein, and she has not been charged with any crimes herself (Snopes is not identifying her to protect her privacy).Indeed, Miami Herald reporter Julie Brown, who was fundamental in uncovering Epstein's alleged sex-trafficking crimes, told us that she never come across the woman's name during her investigation into Epstein: ""I have never run across her name anywhere -- and I checked with two people involved in the case for 12 years and they never heard of her. They suspect it's BS internet conspiracy shit."" We also dug through dozens of Q posts, conspiracy primers, Qanon explainers, and 4chan and 8chan threads attempting to connect her to Clinton and Epstein, but we've yet to see any concrete evidence. Instead, we found invented explanations for out-of-context pictures and illogical leaps of faith being accepted as fact. :The above-displayed picture has been online since 2006. It was originally shared with a caption saying it showed Clinton with a 19-year-old college student aboard billionaire venture capitalist Ron Burkle's private plane. It wasn't until several years later (circa 2017) that the ""Pizzagate"" conspiracy community picked up this picture and started claiming that it showed a woman with Clinton aboard Epstein's plane (popularly dubbed the ""Lolita Express""). The fact that this photograph was circulating for more than a decade before it became attached to claims relating to Epstein should immediately raise red flags. Furthermore, photographs reportedly showing the inside of Epstein's plane don't appear to match with this viral picture. Here's a comparison of the viral Clinton photograph and a picture of Epstein's plane obtained by Radar Online::While we may be entering dot-connecting territory here, the design on the wall behind Clinton bears a resemblance to a photograph from Business Insider supposedly showing the interior of Canadian businessman Frank Giustra's plane. Giustra and Clinton, like Burkle and Clinton, were frequent travel partners:Angel Urena, Clinton's spokesperson, also denied that the viral image was taken aboard Epstein's plane: ""This photograph was not taken on Epstein's airplane.""In addition to misidentifying the location of this photograph, Qanon believers also frequently share this photograph with the claim that the woman was underage at the time the photograph was taken. Again, this is based on pure speculation:::When Gawker first shared this photograph in 2006, the organization claimed it showed a ""19-year-old college student."" This appears to be accurate. In 2009, The Cut identified the woman as a ""22-year-old"" in an article about her photography. This would make her approximately 19 in 2006 when the photograph was allegedly snapped. Clinton did fly on Epstein's plane a number of times. However, the above-displayed photograph does not document one of these trips. This photograph shows Clinton with a young woman aboard a plane more likely owned by either Burkle or Giustra. While the question of who she is may send conspiracy theorists down a rabbit hole of assumptions and speculation, the real answer is quite simple: She is a photographer and co-founder of New York-based modeling agency who was needlessly thrown into this world of conspiracy because she once appeared in a photograph on a plane with Clinton.

Although no evidence currently support claims of ties between Soros and the caravan, the message ""FBI JUST CONFIRMED SOROS & OTHER DEMOCRATIC DONORS ARE FINANCING THE CARAVAN"" was parroted by dozens of Twitter accounts::Verbatim copies of this message were also spread by a large number of Facebook users::None of the postings we've encountered have attempted to provide any sort of proof to back up this claim. The social media accounts in this echo chamber did not provide links to news reports, FBI bulletins, or even fake news articles claiming that Soros was financing the migrant caravan from Honduras.Furthermore, the FBI has not released any statements or press releases about Soros' alleged involvement in funding a migrant caravan. We also couldn't find any credible news reports suggesting that the FBI had made such an announcement.So where did this message come from? The earliest and most popular example we could uncover was posted by Facebook user ""Jim Snyder"" on the morning of 22 October 2018. Snyder actually labeled his message ""fake news"" in the comment section, but as it went viral (racking up nearly 40,000 shares within two days) and amassed hundreds of comments, many social media users simply missed the surprising disclaimer and shared this message as if it were reporting a genuine newsworthy revelation: ""This is FAKE NEWS. The FBI should find out & let us know. Follow the money. This is a national emergency."":The FBI has not confirmed that Soros was funding the migrant caravan from Honduras. This viral Facebook message is merely one individual's rather successful attempt at trolling.A number of Facebook users pushed back on Snyder for spreading this false rumor. He responded by saying that he posted this message in order to ""keep the Snowflakes on there [sic] toes""::It doesn't appear that Snyder intended for his message to fool tens of thousands of social media users, but his message did feed into the conspiracy theory that Soros is some sort of nefarious puppet master.It should be noted that Snyder's fear-mongering post went viral the day before a bomb was placed in the mailbox at Soros' home in New York. While Snyder implored Americans to be ""better than this"" in the comments section of his viral post, he returned to his fear-mongering tactics the following morning after a series of bombs were mailed to politicians and news organizations:"

""I don't have any qualms about it at all, you know. I feel quite proud of myself for doing something like this. ... It's just a small thing that can help zillions of people in this country,"" he told reporters at the time.On Jan. 22, 2021, Aaron died in his sleep, according to the Atlanta Braves, his long-time team. No cause of death was provided at the time. Based on no more than this temporal link, anti-vaccine activists -- most prominently Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and his ""Children's Health Defense"" (CHD) charity -- have capitalized on Aaron's death, arguing it may have been caused by the vaccine.""Aaron's tragic death is part of a wave of suspicious deaths among elderly closely following administration of COVID vaccines,"" Kennedy wrote on Twitter while promoting a link to a blog post by his charity titled ""Home Run King Hank Aaron Dies of 'Undisclosed Cause' 18 Days After Receiving Moderna Vaccine."" The treatment of Aaron's death by anti-vaccine activists is typical of the way the anti-vaccine movement uses elderly deaths to sow doubt over vaccines.:Aaron's death is also representative of one of the central public relations challenges facing the initial roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccine: That the first people being vaccinated belong to a population who -- solely by the virtue of their age -- are most likely to die within a short period of time following that shot regardless of vaccination.On Jan. 25 2021, the Morehouse School of Medicine released a statement in disputing any link between Aaron's death and the vaccine. ""His passing was not related to the vaccine, nor did he experience any side effects from the immunization,"" they wrote. ""He passed away peacefully in his sleep."" The Fulton County Medical Examiner's office, as well, concluded that there was no indication that the COVID-19 vaccine was a contributing factor in his death.""The risk of the public misinterpreting such anecdotal reports may be especially acute early on in the rollout, when elderly adults and people with health conditions have been prioritized to get the vaccine,"" STAT News' Helen Branswell wrote in a Dec. 28, 2020 piece. Based on Social Security Agency actuarial tables, an 86-year-old-man like Aaron would have had a 10% chance of dying within his 86th year based solely on age.:Contrary to Kennedy's claim, there has not been a ""wave"" of ""suspicious deaths"" among the elderly. What there have been, instead, are breathless reports filled with speculation about a few deaths of people -- largely in their 80s and 90s -- who had been vaccinated before their death. That activists would utilize likely coincidental deaths of elderly individuals was predicted by public health officials early on; Kennedy has proven them correct. The CHD blog post similarly invokes the deaths of elderly individuals in Norway as evidence of the risk of COVID-19 vaccination. As we explained in an earlier fact check, the only people receiving the COVID-19 vaccine in Norway currently are those in nursing homes or assisted living. An average of 400 people die each week in nursing homes and long-term care facilities in Norway, according to that nation's medical agency. Further, these individuals were given the Pfizer vaccine. Aaron received the Moderna vaccine.While it is not impossible, in theory, for some adverse reactions such as fever and nausea from mRNA vaccines currently in use to contribute to a potentially fatal outcome in older, frail patients, a temporal link on its own is insufficient evidence of causation. Fully investigating cases with a close temporal link like Aaron's takes time, but innuendo surrounding those cases can cause immediate damage, according to some experts.:""Once there's a news report people have read, it doesn't matter what we prove categorically two years later in a study, that perception will remain, and it's hard to combat,"" Art Reingold, chair of the division of epidemiology and biostatistics at University of California Berkeley's School of Public, told STAT news in December 2020.""I fear a loss of confidence in the vaccine,"" Helen Keipp Talbot, an associate professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University, said in the same story. ""That the vaccine will actually truly be safe, but there will be temporally associated events and people will be scared to use the vaccine.""Finally, it is important to note that Kennedy is a conspiracy theorist with a dismal track record of accurately conveying scientific information about vaccines. He has long promoted the discredited link between vaccines and autism. He wrote the foreword to a book by disgraced scientist Judy Mikovits, who starred in the pseudo-documentary ""Plandemic"" that denied the reality of the COVID-19 pandemic. He frequently promotes Bill Gates conspiracy theories, including those suggesting the billionaire wants to use COVID-19 shots to insert microchips to monitor the global population (a topic we debunked here).:In short, Kennedy is not a credible source for reality-based, good-faith arguments on vaccine safety, even if we had the data to demonstrate a link between Aaron's death and his vaccination with the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Because we do not, however, the claim remains ""Unproven."":"

QAnon refers to the fringe, yet wide-ranging, and completely unfounded, conspiracy theory that claimed Trump was waging a secret war against elite, Satan-worshipping pedophiles in government, business, and the media.:The Washington Post reported that MyPillow ran a weekend promotion that gave customers a discount if they used the coupon code ""QAnon."" Screenshots of this discount code were shared by Sara Cook, a CBS News producer, and Mediaite.Mediaite reported that codes like ""Q"" and ""storm"" were also being used, terms that are affiliated with the conspiracy theory. ""Storm"" refers to QAnon conspiracy theories that long held Jan. 6, 2021, would bring a dramatic and violent event they called ""The Storm,"" which would lead to mass executions of Trump's enemies. QAnon adherents believed that their marching on the Capitol would trigger this violence.:We checked whether ""QAnon"" and ""storm"" were still being applied as discount codes on MyPillow's website as of this writing, and found they were not. But using ""Q"" on the website will still give users a discount. We cannot confirm whether the use of ""Q"" on the site is a direct reference to QAnon.Lindell said that a backlash against his company had begun ever since the Capitol riots. Indeed, major companies like Bed Bath & Beyond and Kohl's had dropped his products.:Conservative pundit Dinesh D'Souza tweeted his support of MyPillow, and urged customers to use the promo code ""Dinesh"" to get a discount.

606,606,563.BernieSandersFaceboo,"On 25 April 2016, a number of popular Bernie Sanders Facebook groups purportedly became inaccessible, all at the same time. The pages were evidently removed because they were being inundated with spam that consisted of explicitly pornographic photographs. According to stories that immediately began to circulate, the spam came as part of a coordinated attack from Hillary Clinton supporters.Not long after rumors about the groups' removals swept Facebook, a Reddit user started a thread on the r/sandersforpresident subreddit (a hub for Sanders campaign social media organizing):UPDATE - now SIX of the largest Bernie groups have disappeared from Facebook within the last 15min's! I've given the link to this Reddit as a way to stay in touch for people who had never been on or heard of Reddit.Edit to add - they have now also removed Bernie Sanders for President 2016 (118k members) and Bernie Sanders 2016 - Ideas Welcome.

They openly spin their strategy on the Correct The Record website and state that they are putting over $1 million behind their efforts.As you likely know, Super PACs are allowed to raise and spend unlimited money on these types of efforts.:King pointed to a Paste article published on 22 April 2016 about Brock's purported astroturfing efforts on social media:Using a tactic called ""astro-turfing,"" Clinton surrogates like Brock have attempted to advance the concept of the ""Bernie Bro,"" and to promote the idea that Sanders supporters are little more than a sexist cult. The moderator of the thriving Bernie Sanders for President Reddit page, preparing for an onslaught, recently outlined one common form these attacks take:1. Create fake accounts2. Establish that they are Bernie supporters by making them tweet about Bernie3. Harass journalists and influencers in their @ mentions4. Have other elites/influencers quote tweet these fake accounts and say they are hurting Bernie's brand5. Pitch a story to The Atlantic about the phenomenon of ""Bernie Bros"":6.Establish a narrative that Bernie's supporters are all racist, sexist young males who harass people online.7. Make it more difficult for Sanders to expand his coalition by tainting the view of said coalition for women, people of color, and anyone who just doesn't like online harassment/bullying.Yesterday, Correct the Record announced they'd be taking it a step further. A new initiative called ""Barrier Breakers 2016"" will use $1 million (for now) to ""help Clinton supporters push back on online harassment and thank superdelegates.""The page to which Paste linked was undated, but the site pegged Correct the Record's genesis to 21 April 2016, when it announced plans for a ""digital task force"":In response to these attacks on supporters and superdelegates, Correct The Record is launching the Barrier Breakers 2016 digital task force. While Hillary Clinton fights to break down barriers and bring America together, the Barrier Breakers 2016 digital task force will serve as a resource for supporters looking for positive content and push-back to share with their online progressive communities, as well as thanking prominent supporters and committed superdelegates on social media.:Correct The Record will invest more than $1 million into Barrier Breakers 2016 activities, including the more than tripling of its digital operation to engage in online messaging both for Secretary Clinton and to push back against attackers on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and Instagram. Barrier Breakers 2016 is a project of Correct The Record and the brainchild of David Brock, and the task force will be overseen by President of Correct The Record Brad Woodhouse and Digital Director Benjamin Fischbein. The task force staff's backgrounds are as diverse as the community they will be engaging with and include former reporters, bloggers, public affairs specialists, designers, Ready for Hillary alumni, and Hillary super fans who have led groups similar to those with which the task force will organize.Lessons learned from online engagement with ""Bernie Bros"" during the Democratic Primary will be applied to the rest of the primary season and general election-responding quickly and forcefully to negative attacks and false narratives. Additionally, as the general election approaches, the task force will begin to push out information to Sanders supporters online, encouraging them to support Hillary Clinton.A now-deleted post published to r/sandersforpresident (and reproduced to r/conspiracy) was submitted by an individual who claimed to be a former astroturfer for Clinton operatives.

(This is a one-time throwaway account, but I'll stick around for this thread.)First, my background. I am [redacted] ... and first became involved in politics during the 2008 presidential race. I worked as a volunteer for Hillary during the Democratic primary and then for the Democratic Party in the general election. I was not heavily involved in the 2012 election cycle (employment issues - volunteering doesn't pay the rent), and I wasn't really planning on getting involved in this cycle until I was contacted by a friend from college around six months ago about working on Hillary's campaign ... I don't want to get bogged down on this subject, but I was involved with PPP (pay per post) on forums and in the comments section of (mostly-liberal) news and blog sites. Spending my time on weekends and evenings, I brought in roughly an extra $100 or so a week, which was a nice cushion for me.At first, the work was fun and mostly unsupervised. I posted mostly positive things about Hillary and didn't engage in much negativity. Around the middle of July, however, I received notification that the team would be focusing not on pro-Hillary forum management, but on ""mitigation"" (the term our team leader used) for a Vermont senator named Bernie Sanders. I'd been out of college for several years and hadn't heard much about Sanders, and so I decided to do some research to get a feel for him.:The real problem for me started around the end of September and the beginning of October, when there was a change of direction from the team leader again. Apparently, the higher-ups in the firm caught wind of an impending spending splurge by the Clinton campaign that month and wanted to put up an impressive display. We received very specific instructions about how and what to post, and I was aghast at what I saw. It was a complete change in tone and approach, and it was extremely nasty in character. We changed from advocates to hatchet men, and it left a very bad taste in my mouth.However, moderators for r/sandersforpresident removed the post, because its original author failed or refused to provide any proof of their accusations.Screenshots that seekingly originated with a Facebook page called Bros4Hillary appear to show that the removal of pro-Sanders pages was due to the efforts of at least one person:: The Bros4Hillary Facebook group went private shortly after screenshots began to circulate:: Bros4Hillary's political director told Heavy.comthat the group was not responsible overall:""Bros4Hillary was created as a way to provide a positive and supportive community for supporters of Hillary Clinton to gather, and as a direct response to the hateful and divisive rhetoric used by other campaigns during this election cycle,"" he said. ""We have not and do not approve of or condone harmful or offensive rhetoric or harassing behavior targeting supporters of any other candidate in the race...""He then addressed specifically what happened on Monday.""Last night, a former member ... decided to engage in harassing behavior toward Facebook groups of Bernie Sanders and posted about it in the B4H Facebook group,"" he said. ""...This was not promoted or supported by the leadership of B4H... We removed the offending posts and member as soon as possible.""All groups were reported functional as of 25 April 2016::As of 23:55 ET all groups pages affected appear to be back up and running. Thank you all for your concern and reporting on the situation. Let's go onwards and focus on getting more victories!On 26 April 2016, digital and social media manager for the Sanders campaign Aiden King addressed the rumors on the campaign's official Slack channel:All of the groups are back up and it wasn't just Bernie groups.Facebook hasn't released a public statement but they had a bug and it closed a ton of facebook groups. Our supporters are just more vocal so the internet blew up with ""Bernie groups being shut down"" rather than ""Facebook groups are being shut down.""King claimed a number of groups were affected by a Facebook glitch, not just pro-Sanders groups. However, Facebook didn't address the bug officially, leading many to believe the outages were politically motivated and not related to malfunctioning technology. Facebook hasn't confirmed King's assertion, nor did he disclose how he learned of the purported bug.:"

What's FalseThis symbol is not found on all Nike shoes, is not a nod to the Illuminati, and is not evidence that Nike has ""embraced satanism.""he designer of the shoe said that this is an ""all-seeing eye"" symbol and not a nod to the Illuminati.:Many of the calls to boycott Nike in September 2018 centered on the idea that the apparel company was disrespecting the United States by featuring Colin Kaepernick, one of the most prominent football players to kneel in protest against police brutality and racial inequality during the performance of the national anthem before NFL games, in their latest ad campaign. By week two of this controversy, however, some social users media were seeking out inventive new reasons to avoid the swoosh.In mid-September 2018, an image purportedly showing an ""alarming"" Illuminati symbol on the pull-tab of a Nike sneaker started circulating on social media, along with the claim that the company had ""officially embraced satanism""::This is a genuine product sold by Nike. However, it is not evidence that the company has ""embraced satanism,"" and the designer of the shoe might push back on claims that this is an ""Illuminati"" symbol. This symbol is indeed an element of Nike's ""Kyrie 4,"" NBA player Kyrie Irving's Signature Sneaker line, and is featured on a number of product shots via the official Nike website:According to shoe designer Benjamin Nethongkome, the symbol featured on these shoes is an ""all-seeing eye,"" a symbol has been associated with a number of different groups throughout history. Also known as the Eye of Providence, this symbol has been used to represent God's omnipresence and is also often used in reference to the Illuminati, a secret society at the heart of several conspiracy theories.  It's also part of the design used on the reverse of the U.S. $1 bill::Nethongkome explained why he chose to utilize that symbol in a December 2017 interview with Bleacher Report published around the time that the ""Kyrie 4"" line was released:""One last detail we added, which is a dope one, is right behind the leather pull tab: an all-seeing eye graphic,"" Nethongkome says. ""Not to represent the illuminati. The third eye is to challenge everyone to think beyond what they see. That'll be directly behind the pull tab on the tongue."":This philosophy seems to falls in line with Kyrie Irving's view of the world. The Celtic point guard has tinkered with conspiracy theories in the past and has stated on at least one occasion that ""the earth is flat."" When pressed about these ideas, however, Irving always seems to segue into the argument that he just wants people to think for themselves:Irving went on Geno Auriemma's Holding Court podcast to talk basketball, but of course, as always, the flat-Earth theory came up. And Irving, like he'd been doing up until that point, said he put the theory out there to prove a point. But he also continued to say that he hasn't seen any real pictures of the Earth.Auriemma pressed Irving out about that, saying that we've seen shots of the Earth from space via NASA's satellites, which is totally true. But Irving wouldn't stop there. He wasn't having it.""I'm saying, Coach, that you don't even know if they're real or not,"" Irving said. ""I just wanted to have that conversation. That's it. I wanted to actually know or ask other individuals, Bro -- excuse me -- Coach and Sue, do you really think that this actually happened? I don't know. I don't know, either. I just want to know.""Irving, who is best known as an NBA player with the Boston Celtics, has made a few controversial statements over the years about his apparent belief in conspiracy theories, such as the idea that the earth is flat, not round.:The symbol showcased on these Nike shoes is not evidence that the company has ""officially embraced satanism."" Rather, these images show that the company has embraced an NBA star who expresses some odd (and false) ideas about the universe."
608,608,353.DidRepBoebertGetHerG,"Claim:U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert received her GED diploma a few months before winning election to the House of Representatives.Rating:TrueAbout this rating In January 2021, many social media users started posting messages claiming that U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) had received a GED diploma (the equivalent of a high school diploma, earned by passing General Educational Development tests) months before she was elected to congress. :The claims made in this meme are largely accurate. :Boebert has supported the QAnon conspiracy theory. A spokesperson for Boebert also confirmed that the 34-year-old congresswoman earned her GED diploma in 2020. Boebert talked about her education with Colorado's Durango Herald in September 2020. The then-congressional candidate said that she was a ""good student"" when she attended Rifle High School but that she was a new mom at the time and prioritized raising her family over her education. Boebert said:On her educational background, she said she never claimed to have graduated from Rifle High School. ""I went to my high school,"" she said.""I was a brand-new mom, and I had to make hard decisions on successfully raising my child, or getting to high school biology class. And I chose to take care of my child,"" she said.Boebert said she received her GED after completing a four-course review.""I didn't go through the typical education course,"" she said. ""I was a great student. I had great grades. I loved being there, but I was starting my family and had different priorities."":It should also be noted that although many people have spread this bit of trivia as a way of denigrating Boebert, the Colorado congresswoman is not the first person elected to office without a college education. According to a December 2020 report from the Congressional Research Service, ""17 Members of the House have no educational degree beyond a high school diploma.""While the vast majority of politicians in 2020 have a college degree, that hasn't always been the case. According to The Washington Post, the percentage of politicians with college degrees has been steadily climbing for decades. In 1947, though, just over 50% of House members had a college degree.Boebert responded to the online criticisms of her education in a January 2021 tweet, writing that ""you don't need an Ivy League degree to achieve the American Dream."":It's worth mentioning that while Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has truly been criticized for being a bartender, as noted in the above-displayed tweet, she also graduated cum laude from Boston University in 2011. To sum up: It's true that Boebert, along with 16 other members of the House of Representatives, does not have a college education. Boebert received her GED diploma before she was elected to Congress in 2020. "

The post with the CNN video showed anchors John Berman and Don Lemon and purported to show that the news network had rebroadcast old footage from a crude oil tank farm explosion in Edmonton, Canada, to represent an explosion in Lviv, Ukraine, during Russia's invasion in 2022.:The conspiracy theory arose after some users noticed some firefighters in Lviv were wearing gear with the word ""Edmonton"" on their backs.According to CityNews Edmonton, the truth of the matter was simple. The reason why some of the firefighters in Lviv were seen wearing turnout coats with the word ""Edmonton"" was that firefighters in Canada had kindly donated some of their gear to Ukraine.The VideoThe original video of Lemon's reporting live from the aftermath of an explosion in Lviv was posted by a CNN anchor producer to Twitter. It was broadcast in the morning in the U.S., which was the evening for Ukraine::The Debunked Conspiracy TheoryOn Telegram, @endilluminati first posted a screenshot from the CNN video with Lemon with a circle around the word ""Edmonton"" on a firefighter and the following caption:1. They filmed it in the U.S. or Canada.2. They were donated.But it's CNN we're talking about. Their credibility doesn't have a good standing.The post was seen nearly 34,000 times and appeared like this: The Telegram account first shared this post. It circled the word ""Edmonton"" on the back of one of the firefighters in Lviv.:Minutes later, the same Telegram account shared the video in question with these words: ""Explosions near Lviv or explosions from Edmonton crude oil tank farm in 2021?""

Police also found on his telephone photos of checkpoints in the region, which Kozytskyy said had been sent to two Russian telephone numbers.Rockets hit an oil storage facility and an unspecified industrial facility, wounding at least five people. A thick plume of smoke and towering flames could be seen on Lviv's outskirts hours after the attacks.'Edmonton' on Lviv Firefighter Turnout Coat:As previously mentioned, there was a reason why some of the firefighters in the CNN video from Lviv had ""Edmonton"" written across their backs.

610,610,509.DoPhotosShowGretaThu,"Claim:Photographs shared widely in September 2019 showed Greta Thunberg posing with George Soros and a member of Isis and ""aligning herself"" with Antifa.Rating:Mostly FalseAbout this rating What's TrueThe photograph of Thunberg wearing an ""Antifascist All Stars"" T-shirt was authentic.What's FalseHowever, the girl shown standing next to an ISIS militant was not Thunberg; the photograph of Thunberg with Soros was doctored; and Thunberg's wearing of an ""Antifascist All Stars"" T-shirt was far from an unambiguous gesture of ""alignment"" with the Antifa movement. :In September 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the authenticity and provenance of several photographs that appeared to show teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg of Sweden posing next to the billionaire George Soros, a member of Isis, and with what was described as ""the Antifa terrorist organization.""The social media attacks on Thunberg coincided with the renowned climate activist's high-profile appearances before the U.S. Congress and the United Nations.On Sept. 23, a Facebook user going by the name Stephen Potter posted a collage of three separate images accompanied by the caption, ""Well well well ... do I need to explain anymore? #AnonsKnew #GretaThunberg #DeepStatePuppet""::The images and caption purported to be a screenshot of an earlier post by a Facebook user going by the name ""Kristen Shadowbanned Seefeldt,"" who regularly promotes the discredited and debunked #QAnon conspiracy theory. However, such a post was not visible on her page on Sept. 24, which means we cannot verify that it originated there, though it is possible the post had been deleted or removed from public view by then.Whatever the origins of Potter's post, the images contained in the collage were either doctored, did not show Thunberg, or included a misleading description.Thunberg with Isis?:The above image does not show Thunberg. It was taken during a Quran recital contest hosted by Isis members in Aleppo, Syria, in 2013, as we outlined in an earlier fact check article.Thunberg with George Soros?This image does show Thunberg, but the face of financier and philanthropist George Soros has been digitally superimposed onto the body of the man standing next to her. The original photograph actually pictured former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and was posted to Twitter by Thunberg in December 2018::Thank you @algore for being a true pioneer. Very few people have done more. It was an honour to meet you. #climatecrisis #climatebreakdown pic.twitter.com/HzbvPcGkwu-- Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) December 30, 2018The doctored image was created by the French website SecretNews, which presents its content as satire, as part of an Aug. 28 article with the headline (translated), ""Greta Thunberg is the granddaughter of left-wing billionaire George Soros."" Others, apparently unaware of the ""satire"" label applied to all SecretNews content, have mistakenly understood that article to be genuine and promulgated the false claim that Thunberg and Soros were family relatives::Thunberg is aligned with 'the terrorist organization Antifa'?:The underlying image in this meme was the only one of the three photographs that was authentic, unedited, and also showed Thunberg. She posted it to her Twitter account in July 2019 as part of a campaign to promote the band The 1975, which featured a speech by Thunberg and was set to be the opening track on The 1975's forthcoming album ""Notes on a Conditional Form.""The original photograph showed the band's lead singer Matt Healy sitting next to Thunberg, who wore a T-shirt bearing the slogan ""Antifascist All Stars""::Opposing fascism or wearing an ""Antifascist All Stars"" T-shirt does not necessarily make one a member or supporter of ""Antifa,"" a frequently misunderstood and misused term that describes a movement of typically militant and sometimes violent left-wing activists in the United States and beyond.Despite those nuances, Thunberg appears to have received criticism from some quarters for her decision to wear the T-shirt, and she eventually deleted the original photograph from her social media account. In a subsequent tweet, she offered an explanation that made it clear she had intended only to express her opposition to fascism, and that she rejected the use of violence:Yesterday I posted a photo wearing a borrowed T-shirt that says I'm against fascism. That T-shirt can apparently to some be linked to a violent movement. I don't support any form of violence and to avoid misunderstandings I've deleted the post. And of course I am against fascism.-- Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) July 26, 2019: Given the inherent ambiguity of meaning in wearing the T-shirt, as well as Thunberg's subsequent explanation and deletion of her tweet, it is difficult to support the characterization of the photograph contained in the meme, which claimed Thunberg had ""aligned"" herself with Antifa.The description of Antifa as a ""terrorist organization"" is also questionable. In the U.S., the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) does not currently list Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, but the summer of 2019 saw increasing calls for such a designation.In July, Republican Senators Bill Cassidy (Louisiana) and Ted Cruz (Texas) introduced a U.S. Senate resolution calling for ""groups and organizations across the country who act under the banner of Antifa to be designated as domestic terrorist organizations."" In August, President Donald Trump warned, in a tweet that ""Major consideration is being given to naming Antifa an 'organization of terror.'"":Aside from the lack of any official designation, no fixed, universally accepted definition of ""terrorist"" or ""terrorist organization"" exists, so the question of whether Antifa -- which is more a transnational movement than a traditional, hierarchical organization -- should be labeled as such is ultimately a matter for subjective argument."

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. In May 2020, a video started to circulate online that supposedly showed an Italian politician calling for the arrest of Bill Gates, the former Microsoft CEO who has been at the center of several conspiracy theories due to his foundation's work to develop a vaccine for the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. This video was frequently shared on social media with the caption, ""Italian Government call for arrest of Bill Gates""::This is a genuine video of an Italian politician calling for Gates' arrest. However, a single politician's opinion does not equate to the entire Italian government calling for action. In fact, this view has been condemned by Italian government officials (you can hear this politician being told ""enough"" and to be quiet during the video).The politician in this video is Italian Parliament Member Sara Cunial. She's part of Italy's ""5 Star Movement,"" a political party that has been blamed for a rise of measles in Italy after pushing an anti-vaccination agenda. Cunial, who was briefly suspended from the party in 2018 after likening vaccines to ""free genocide"" in a Facebook post, was fined in April 2020 for violating one of the country's shelter-in place policies to visit a beach. (Cunial claims she was never fined.)Cunial's speech before the Italian Parliament hit on a number of popular (and discredited) conspiracy theories regarding COVID-19. For instance, she linked the spread of the disease to the rise of 5G technology, claimed that Gates was working to de-populate the world, and said that the ""ID2020"" coalition was working to secretly implement digital microchips via mandatory vaccines.:Cunial also fabricated a quote from Gates. After claiming that this was an ""exact quote"" from a Gates' speech, Cunial falsely said that the former Microsoft CEO once stated, ""If we do a good job on vaccines, health and reproduction, we can reduce the world population by 10-15%. Only a genocide can save the world."" Not only is this a fabricated quote, it illustrates a common misconception about Gates' work related to global population.The former Microsoft CEO is working to lower child mortality, improve the health of poorer populations, and give people better access to contraceptives. In other words, Gates is not trying to use vaccines to kill children. Rather, he is hoping that a lower child mortality rate and better supportive programs will reduce the need for parents to have more children. Gates articulated his goals in a 2009 letter from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation:A surprising but critical fact we learned was that reducing the number of deaths actually reduces population growth. [...] Contrary to the Malthusian view that population will grow to the limit of however many kids can be fed, in fact parents choose to have enough kids to give them a high chance that several will survive to support them as they grow old. As the number of kids who survive to adulthood goes up, parents can achieve this goal without having as many children.:Not only was Cunial's speech littered with conspiracy theories, the politician also blamed Italy's leadership for allowing dogmatic scientism to become the ""true cultural epidemic"" of this country.  This comment created some blowback (Cunial curiously claimed that she was not referring to Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte) and some politicians urged her to apologize for the remark.Vice President of the Chamber of Deputies Mara Carfagna wrote on Twitter: ""Connecting phantom plots to the Head of State is unworthy of an institutional representative."":In sum, it is true that an Italian politician spouted a number of conspiracy theories and called for the arrest of Gates during an address to Parliament. However, this viewpoint was not widely endorsed by the Italian government.  "

However, that address has no connection with the Caribbean island known as Little St. James in the U.S. Virgin Islands that was owned by Epstein, at which under-aged girls were allegedly sexually abused.:As shown in the post reproduced above, a Google search for ""Little St James Island Theme Park"" did at one point return information displaying an address of ""124 Conch Street, Bikini bottom"" as being associated with that notorious Epstein property in the U.S. Virgin Islands:However, as The Wall Street Journal had reported about a year earlier, Google Maps and its online business listings have been highly prone to being gamed and propagated with false information (for fun and profit):Google's ubiquitous internet platform shapes what's real and what isn't for more than two billion monthly users. Yet Google Maps is overrun with millions of false business addresses and fake names, according to advertisers, search experts and current and former Google employees:Google still can't seem to stop the proliferation of fictional business listings and aggressive con artists on its search engine. The scams are profitable for nearly everyone involved, Google included.

A Viennese patisserie was among the businesses at addresses purported to house lawyers. The fakes vanished after inquiries to Google from The Wall Street Journal.The false listings benefit businesses seeking more customer calls by sprinkling made-up branches in various corners of a city. In other cases, calls to listed phone numbers connect to unscrupulous competitors, a misdirection forbidden by Google rules but sporadically policed by the company.Hundreds of thousands of false listings sprout on Google Maps each month, according to experts. Google says it catches many others before they appear.:This same information was pointed out by multiple social media users responding to postings about this conspiracy theory:The SpongeBob/Epstein address coincidence (which Google appears to have removed as of this writing) seems to have been nothing more than a spoof positing a non-existent connection between two pop culture figures, one a beloved, fictional children's figure, and the other a real-life, disgraced sex offender.:"

The headline reads, in part, ""Parkland First Responder: I Was Told to Stand Down."":The article reads in part:A first responder to the Parkland school shooting claims he was told to stand down and not enter the building to recover victims, which he believes would have saved lives.Speaking to a WSVN Miami News 7 reporter, an emergency medical responder who was one of the first at the scene said law enforcement did not follow mass casualty event protocols.The story is based solely on a tweet composed by Miami-based WSVN reporter Brian Entin, who documented his conversation with an emergency medical services (EMS) responder. The medic expressed frustration about being forced to wait outside the high school where seventeen people were fatally shot while law enforcement secured the scene:""Everything I was trained on mass casualty events says they did the wrong thing.""

It is common practice for EMS providers to wait for law enforcement to give them the green light before entering an active crime scene.Although local law enforcement has been heavily criticized for their response to the 14 February 2018 school shooting and questions have been raised about whether they did enough to prevent loss of life, the nebulous ""stand down"" order is a familiar theme in conspiracy theories about disastrous incidents.For example, after a deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia on 12 August 2017, the fake news site YourNewsWire published a bogus story reporting police had been given such an order. Although Charlottesville police were slammed and their response cited for failing to effectively counter violence, there is no evidence an official ""stand down order"" was ever given. A similar theme was present in conspiracy theories about the 2012 deadly attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Although it was widely reported a ""stand down order"" was given to the consulate security team, no evidence of such an order exists.:Infowars.com and its coterie of ranting Internet trolls have been the focus of news stories in the weeks after the Parkland shooting as culprits who spread conspiracy theories after mass shootings that enable the stalking and harassment of victims and survivors. Video platform YouTube has penalized Infowars for spreading false rumors that the teenagers who survived the Parkland shooting are ""crisis actors."""

They have 100 year plans and they tell us right out in the open all the time but we don't pay attention!

This is another piece of conspiracy-themed content that falsely claims the pandemic was planned. :One giveaway that this cartoon was not created in the 1930s is the use of the word ""weaponize."" The term ""weaponized influenza"" is used in this cartoon, but the first use of the word ""weaponize"" (in the literal sense of turning something into a military weapon) didn't occur until the 1950s.Weaponize originated as technical jargon in the U.S. military. At the onset of the Cold War, scientists weaponized rockets, fitting them with nuclear material and equipping them for launch. The Oxford English Dictionary first attests weaponize in 1957, citing the controversial aerospace pioneer Wernher von Braun, who used the neologism in the New York Times with respect to ballistic missiles. That same year, Aviation Week wrote of weaponization as ""the latest of the coined words by missile scientists.""While the animation may look similar to the cartoons of the 1930s, there are some animation techniques used in this video that simply weren't available to animators in the 1930s. The debunking site HoaxEye, for example, found that this ""Early Warning Cartoon"" used ""mesh warping,"" a technique that requires a computer to quickly and repeatedly change the size of an image. We reached out to Jerry Beck, an animation historian who currently teaches character animation at the California Institute of the Arts, for his opinion on this cartoon. :Beck said: ""This is NOT an old cartoon. It's someone trying very hard to make some Flash Animation look like an old dupey cartoon.""Beck noted that this cartoon does pay homage to a number of old cartoons from the 1930s, such as the devils that appear in this 1934 Betty Boop cartoon:The ""early warning cartoon"" was not created in the 1930s. Therefore, it is in no way a ""prediction."" This is a modern video that was created to push conspiratorial claims about that pandemic. This video was created in the same vein as the ""Plandemic"" conspiracy theory or the ""Operation Lockstep"" conspiracy theory. These claims hold that the COVID-19 pandemic was ""planned"" by a nefarious group in order to control the world's population.:While you can read more about these theories -- and why they hold no water -- here and here, one of the biggest indications that these conspiracy theories are just that is the fact that they are so frequently pushed using deceptive methods. For example, one could create a video in 2021 and share it as if it shows a cartoon from the 1930s in order to convince people that something nefarious is taking place. "

Rating:MiscaptionedAbout this rating ContextThe simple truth was that the photograph showed Paul Pelosi Jr. helping a little girl cut a cake. Other pictures showed that the girl was one of several children of a woman Pelosi allegedly had a relationship with. The little girl was not tied up, no cocaine was visible, and there's no evidence that the image had anything to do with a laptop, much less Hunter Biden's.:In July 2022, following the news that Hunter Biden's iCloud account had allegedly been hacked, conspiracy theorists shared a picture that they claimed came from a laptop that also was associated with U.S. President Joe Biden's son. The photograph purportedly showed Paul Pelosi Jr., the son of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, doing lines of cocaine with a ""tied up Asian girl."" A review of the facts showed that none of these accusations were true.Misleading MemesThe truth of this picture was that it simply showed Paul Pelosi Jr. cutting a cake with a young girl. The girl was not ""tied up,"" nor was cocaine visible anywhere in the photograph. The only other visible objects on the table appeared to be bottles of Gatorade. Further, there was no evidence that the picture had anything to do with a laptop or Hunter Biden.:One of the false memes from Twitter read, ""Just Nancy Pelosi's son with a tied up Asian girl doing lines of coke. Found on Hunter's laptop. Still think this is Russia disinformation? WAKE THE FUCK UP.""An Alleged RelationshipWe previously reported on various rumors regarding a laptop apparently owned by Hunter Biden, which became a larger story in November 2020. Fact-checkers at PolitiFact rated the Pelosi Jr. conspiracy theory ""False"" just days before the 2020 U.S. presidential election, which meant that it, too, was an old rumor.According to PolitiFact's reporting, the little girl appeared to be the daughter of Karen Feng, a woman Pelosi Jr. allegedly had a relationship with. Images of him with Feng and several children were posted in stories published by the National File website in late 2019. This evidence showed that the rumor about Pelosi Jr. being ""with a tied up Asian girl doing lines of coke"" was false.Hunter Biden's iCloud Account:Rumors that Hunter Biden's iCloud account was compromised by a 4chan message board user first went around in July 2022, when a hacker claimed to have accessed 450 GB of files from an iPhone and iPad associated with the president's son. News of the purported hack quickly made its way around social media, prompting the resurrection of older rumors, including some tied to Biden's laptop, such as the one about Pelosi Jr. and the little girl.Other rumors and hoaxes we reported on in the wake of the alleged iCloud hack included images from a video supposedly showing Joe Biden naked with a young girl. Another misleading picture did not show Hunter Biden with underage girls, despite what some social media users claimed, nor did he pose shirtless in a bedroom with former first lady Melania Trump.A Grain of SaltThis advisory we published prior to debunking those rumors still holds true::At this stage, we advise readers to take individual rumors and memes that appear to be blooming out of this alleged hack with a grain of salt.

The picture simply showed a Pelosi Jr. helping a young girl cut a cake."
617,617,134.DidtheSuspectedDayto,"Claim:The Dayton, Ohio, mass shooting suspect ""Connor Betts"" is or has assumed the identity of the same Connor Betts who died in Connecticut in 2014. Rating:FalseAbout this rating In the aftermath of a deadly mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio, in August 2019, some online observers claimed to have unearthed evidence that the official public narrative surrounding the suspected gunman, Connor Betts, was sorely incomplete. Betts, according to some, had actually died in 2014. :Those who advanced and promulgated this conspiracy theory (the exact nature of which was unclear) pointed to a February 2014 obituary for a man by the name of Connor Betts of Suffield, Connecticut. Some even speculated that Betts' death had been staged in 2014, and that he had since entered a witness-protection program from which he emerged in August 2019 to perpetrate a mass shooting. According to proponents of the ""2014 death"" theory, three similarities connect the Connor Betts who died in Connecticut in 2014 and the one Dayton police named as the suspected gunman in a mass shooting during the early hours of Aug. 4, 2019, and whom police fatally shot at that time:They shared the same first and last namesThey both had sisters named MeganThey resembled one anotherThese similarities, the theory goes, can only be explained or can best be explained by an elaborate plot of some kind, whether it involved a faked death in 2014, the suspected Dayton shooter assuming an existing identity, or some other conspiracy. :AnalysisThe obituary cited by those promoting the conspiracy theory marked the tragic death of Connor D. Betts, a young man from Suffield, Connecticut who had just turned 22 when he was killed in an accident while working for a local construction company on Feb. 19, 2014.However, the man named by Dayton police as the suspect in the August 2019 mass shooting was Connor Stephen Betts -- a different person with a different middle name. Connor S. Betts, the suspected shooter, was listed on electoral rolls as having a birth year of 1994 (which comports with Dayton police's confirmation that his age was 24), and was registered to vote in Greene County, Ohio, and took part in elections there since 2012 -- that is, both before and after the death of Connor D. Betts in Connecticut in 2014. Connor D. Betts and Connor S. Betts did each have a sister named Megan, however they are also two separate individuals. According to Dayton police, Megan Betts was 22 years old when she was shot to death during the Aug. 4 massacre of which her brother is suspected. On the Greene County, Ohio, voter rolls, she was listed as having been born in 1997 and residing at the same address as Connor S. Betts, her brother and the Dayton shooting suspect. Her full name was listed as Megan Kathleen Betts. :By contrast, we have cross-referenced news archives and court records and confirmed that the full name of Connor D. Betts' sister is highly likely to be Megan B. Betts, and that she was highly likely to have been born in 1986, not 1997. Each Megan Betts is or was a completely different person, separated by more than a decade in age, and bearing little or no physical resemblance to one another. The third plank of the conspiracy theories was the claim that Connor D. Betts and Connor S. Betts had the same physical appearance, meaning they must have been the same person. Setting aside the fact that Connor D. Betts did in fact die in 2014, and any claims to the contrary were liable to be deeply hurtful to his loved ones, the two men did not look the same. At first glance, some photographs showed a certain passing resemblance between them, but a closer examination revealed that any similarities were no more than superficial. A photographic tribute to Connor D. Betts, posted shortly after his death in 2014, contained dozens of photographs of him. The full scope of those photographs demonstrates clearly that he and Connor S. Betts were completely different individuals. :ConclusionAt first glance, the coincidences involved in this conspiracy theory might appear impossibly unlikely to some observers, giving rise to the conclusion that ""something else"" must surely be afoot. In reality, they are not so unlikely at all.According to Social Security Administration (SSA) data, ""Connor"" was the 48th most popular boy's name in Connecticut in 1992 (the year in which Connor D. Betts was born). In 1986, the year in which Megan B. Betts was born, ""Megan"" was the 22nd most popular girl's name in the state. There are therefore lots of Connors and lots of Megans in the state of Connecticut, and the possibility of finding two siblings with those names and respective ages, is much greater than it otherwise would be, due to the popularity of those first names. It is also not that unlikely to find the same brother-sister name pairing replicated in another state, in this case Ohio. The same SSA data shows that ""Connor"" was the 63rd most popular boy's name in Ohio in 1994, the year of Connor Stephen Betts' birth, and ""Megan"" was the ninth most popular girl's name in the state in 1997, the year in which Megan Kathleen Betts was born. Plenty of Connors, even more Megans, live in that state, so a reasonable possibility exists of finding a brother and sister with those names and a two or three-year age gap between them. :"

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.By this point, almost everyone has heard of QAnon, the conspiracy spawned by an anonymous online poster of enigmatic prophecies. Starting with an initial promise in 2017 that Hillary Rodham Clinton would be imminently arrested, a broad group of interpreters divined a conspiracy that saw President Donald Trump's Democratic opponents as a global cabal of Satanic pedophiles.Perhaps the greatest success of the conspiracy is its ability to create a shared alternate reality, a reality that can dismiss everything from a decisive election to a deadly pandemic. The QAnon universe lives on - now largely through involvement in local, not national, Republican politics. Moving on from contesting the election, the movement's new focus is vaccines. The influence of QAnon on pandemic denialism is significant, though the spread of Q in local politics is a source of conflict in many states. :Tug of warThe conspiracy may have begun on an obscure web forum, but it is now influencing the Republican Party at all levels. A recent Daily Kos/Civiqs poll found that 55% of Republicans believe some element of the conspiracy is true. And in many parts of the country, QAnon supporters are winning elections. From local school boards to city councils, QAnon now has dozens of advocates at nearly every level of local government. While many of these positions hold sway far outside Washington, D.C., the breadth of this movement shows its influence is not likely to wane any time soon.:A QAnon supporter is chased by counterprotesters at the state Capitol in Salem, Oregon, on March 28, 2021.John Rudoff/Anadolu Agency via Getty ImagesNot all Republicans are happy with this shift. In South Carolina, Indiana, Michigan and other states, Republican politics are fraught with tensions between QAnon supporters and more traditional conservatives. For instance, in Indiana, local newspaper The Herald Bulletin published a story on March 21, 2021, headlined ""Republican tug-o'-war: Factions vie for influence,"" reporting that ""QAnon believers ... showed their support at the Indiana Statehouse in January, holding signs bearing the QAnon phrase ""#WWG1WGA"" for 'Where we go one, we go all.'"" Kyle Hupfer, chair of the Indiana GOP, was quoted as saying, ""I don't think QAnon is part of the Republican Party. Leaders need to lead in a fact-based, solution-oriented manner and stick to the actual facts that are proven. Not opinions and not conspiracy theories."" State GOP politicians have promoted QAnon in Arizona through social media posts, although one later apologized for doing so, saying, ""Now I think half of them are rather nuts."" In January 2021, the Twitter account of the Republican Party of Hawaii tweeted a defense of QAnon believers. The account also defended a Holocaust denier. The official who posted the tweets was later forced to resign. :A similar confrontation has played out in Huntington Beach, California, where the appointed mayor pro tem - or vice mayor - inspired a vote of no confidence for supporting QAnon along with conspiracies against mask-wearing and vaccines. Part of the conversationMany QAnon proponents post-election have worked to reframe the COVID-19 vaccines not as the solution to a global pandemic but as an attempt by a cabal to control the minds of a hapless world. Opposing mask mandates, vaccines and lockdowns have been effective campaigns for QAnon as it mobilizes anti-government sentiment common among the conservative base of the Republican Party. These efforts appear to be coalescing around bans on making vaccines mandatory. Missouri's Republican-led Senate recently voted to ban so-called vaccine passports, and Texas, Florida, Idaho and Utah have all passed similar legislation. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds is asking for similar legislation. It is unclear to what extent these bans were influenced by QAnon. But they do echo the opposition to masks and vaccines that have shaped the conspiracy. :In California, a recall campaign against Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has targeted his COVID-19 response. The campaign was initially organized by people affiliated with both right-wing militias and QAnon supporters. :These tweets in late January, one of which expressed sympathy for QAnon believers, led to the resignation of the head of the Hawaii Republican Party.Screenshot, Hawaii Free PressNot going awayYotam Ophir, a communications scholar at the University at Buffalo, has studied QAnon. He told me that he doesn't ""see a reason to believe the conspiracy will go away anytime soon."" Part of this is that QAnon has deep historical roots in a variety of other conspiracies, including a centuries-old anti-Semitic conspiracy of a blood libel. The flexibility of the conspiracy has also proved resilient within a shifting political landscape.Perhaps the biggest threat posed by QAnon is articulated by Lindsay Schubiner, a program director at the Western States Center in Portland, Oregon, which works to support democracy and challenge white nationalism.  :""Bigoted conspiracy theories like QAnon have an enormous influence on the context in which local government operates,"" Schubiner told me.

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.Many people around the world looked on aghast as they witnessed the harm done by  conspiracy theories such as QAnon and the myth of the stolen US election that led to the attack on the US Capitol Building on January 6. Yet while these ideas will no doubt fade in time, there is arguably a much more enduring conspiracy theory that also pervades America in the form of young Earth creationism. And it's one that we cannot ignore because it is dangerously opposed to science. In the US today, up to 40% of adults agree with the young Earth creationist claim that all humans are descended from Adam and Eve within the past 10,000 years. They also believe that living creatures are the result of ""special creation"" rather than evolution and shared ancestry. And that that Noah's flood was worldwide and responsible for the sediments in the geologic column (layers of rock built up over millions of years), such as those exposed in the Grand Canyon.:The definitive creationist tome.P&R Publishing, CC BYSuch beliefs derive from the doctrine of biblical infallibility, long accepted as integral to the faith of numerous evangelical and Baptist churches throughout the world, including the Free Church of Scotland. But I would argue that the present-day creationist movement is a fully fledged conspiracy theory. It meets all the criteria, offering a complete parallel universe with its own organisations and rules of evidence, and claims that the scientific establishment promoting evolution is an arrogant and morally corrupt elite.This so-called elite supposedly conspires to monopolise academic employment and research grants. Its alleged objective is to deny divine authority, and the ultimate beneficiary and prime mover is Satan.Creationism re-emerged in this form in reaction to the mid-20th century emphasis on science education. Its key text is the long-time best seller, The Genesis Flood, by John C Whitcomb and Henry M Morris. This provided the inspiration for Morris's own Institute for Creation Research, and for its offshoots, Answers in Genesis and Creation Ministries International.:Ken Ham, the founder and chief executive of Answers in Genesis, is also responsible for the highly lucrative Ark Encounter theme park and Creation Museum in Kentucky. As a visit to any of these websites will show, their creationism is completely hostile to science, while paradoxically claiming to be scientific.https://youtu.be/FCNUG6UL4lI   Demonising and discreditingThese are common conspiracy theory tactics at play. Creationists go to great lengths to demonise the proponents of evolution, and to undermine the overwhelming evidence in its favour.There are numerous organisations, among them Biologos, the American Scientific Affiliation, the Faraday Institute, and the Clergy Letter Project, which describes itself as ""an an endeavor designed to demonstrate that religion and science can be compatible"", that is, promoting evolution science within the context of religious belief. Even so, creationists insist on linking together the separate topics of evolution, materialist philosophy, and the promotion of atheism.:According to Answers in Genesis, evolution science is a work of Satan, while former US Congressman Paul Broun has described it as ""a lie straight from the pit of hell"". When he said that, by the way, he was a member of the House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. https://youtu.be/rikEWuBrkHc   Like other conspiracy theorists, creationists immunise themselves from fact-based criticism. They label the study of the past as based on unprovable assumptions, thus disqualifying in advance the plain evidence of geology.They then attack other evidence by focusing on specific frauds, such as Piltdown man - a hoax skeleton purportedly of a missing link between humans and other apes that was debunked more than 60 years ago - or the dinosaur-bird amalgam ""Archaeoraptor"", discredited by sharp-eyed scientists before ever making it into the peer-reviewed literature (although not before making it into National Geographic).:One favourite target is Ernst Haeckel, whose pictures of embryos, published in 1874, are now considered to be seriously inaccurate. However, they do correctly draw attention to what most matters here: the features shared during development by different organisms - including humans - such as gill arches, a long tail, and eyes on the side rather than the front of the head, confirming they have a common ancestry.Haeckel's name appears on the Answers in Genesis website 92 times. He is also the subject of a lengthy chapter in Jonathan Wells' Icons of Evolution; Science or Myth?. This book, which even has its own high school study guide, was what first convinced me, back in 2013, that creationism was a conspiracy theory.It is a splendid example of creationist tactics, using long-rectified shortcomings (such as those in early studies on Darwinian evolution in peppered moths, in response to changing colours following reduced pollution) to imply that the entire science is fraudulent. Wells has a real PhD in biology, a PhD acquired with the specific goal of ""destroying Darwinism"" - meaning evolution science - from the inside.:Wells is a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute, a conservative thinktank which promotes creationism under the banner of ""Intelligent Design"", and is also linked to other conspiracy theories, such as claims that the consensus on climate change is bogus, and that last November's US presidential election was stolen.How those fighting science denial break down reasoning of conspiracy theories.JohnCook@skepticalscience, Author providedWhat next?Conspiracy theories are always driven by some underlying concern or agenda. The theory that Obama's birth certificate was a forgery, or that the 2020 US election was stolen, are about political legitimacy and will fade as the politicians promoting them fade from memory. The idea that COVID-19 does not exist is proving a little harder to dislodge, but scientists, such as those behind Respectful Insolence, are organising to fight back on science denial and misinformation.I fear that the creationist conspiracy theory will not be so short-lived. It is driven by a deep-seated power struggle within religious communities, between modernists and literalists; between those who regard scripture as coming to us through human authors, however inspired, and those who regard it as a perfect supernatural revelation. And that is a struggle that will be with us for a long time to come.:Paul Braterman, Hon.

620,620,695.TheOccamsRazorArgume,"The assertion that COVID-19 is the byproduct of work performed at or by the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has reportedly gained credibility in recent months. ""Since last year, the lab-origin story has gained new converts and respectability,"" Paul Farhi and Jeremy Barr wrote in a June 2021 Washington Post column, thanks in part to journalists ""who have taken a fresh look at the limited evidence that has dribbled out over the past year.""Snopes does not seek to prove or disprove a laboratory origin for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Instead, Snopes challenges the notion that the ""evidence"" propelling this purported change in narrative is valid. Overwhelmingly, this alleged new information principally stems from a series of self-referential blog posts. That body of work generally repeats the same broad scientific arguments, despite the fact that all the posts -- at least in part -- rely upon misinterpretations of, or false statements about, the science on which their case is built. The story promoted by lab leak advocates is seductive: Powerful scientists unfairly rejected the notion that SARS-CoV-2 came from a lab as a conspiracy theory, but a ragtag collection of ""internet sleuths"" has uncovered damning information suggesting that notion is likely true. That narrative first hit the mainstream with a January 2021 New York magazine ""investigation"" by novelist Nicholson Baker, and in late May 2021, lab leak arguments gained renewed traction when former New York Times science journalists Nicholas Wade and Don McNeil, among others, argued that the totality of evidence made a lab leak the most likely scenario explaining the origin of SARS-CoV-2.:Contrary to these claims, we argue, this narrative is not based on evidence. It is instead based on speculation, innuendo, and overt misinterpretations of scientific research. Here, Snopes focuses on five specific areas of confusion muddying the debate about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.At a GlanceMany hypotheses explicitly or implicitly argue that a bat coronavirus (RaTG13) discovered by the Wuhan Institute of Virology is a direct ancestor of SARS-CoV-2. This is not possible, as the two viruses are separated by between 20 and 50 years of evolution.RaTG13-based hypotheses require a cultured specimen of the virus. There is no evidence that such a specimen has ever existed.Conspiratorial conclusions drawn from the renaming of RaTG13, which had portions of its genome described in past publications under its sample name Ra4991, have distorted the scientific significance of the Mojiang mine in which it was found.Claims that SARS-CoV-2's genome provide ""smoking gun evidence"" of human intervention rely on discredited arguments and quotes from notable scientific figures who have since walked those claims back.Lab leak advocates describe zoonotic spillover -- the process by which an animal virus naturally becomes capable of infecting a human -- in ways that falsely minimize its likelihood.:(The Wuhan Institute of Virology):BackgroundThe Wuhan Institute of Virology has been, since the first SARS outbreak in 2002-03, a premier research institute for the study of coronaviruses, the type of virus responsible for SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. The fact that this lab, which works with bat and human coronaviruses, is located in the city where COVID-19 was first detected is the central undisputed piece of evidence in support of a laboratory leak.A WIV scientist named Shi Zhengli, now the virologist at the center of allegations that her work resulted in the COVID-19 pandemic, is often credited with having identified the bat origins of the 2002-03 SARS outbreak. SARS, caused by the virus SARS-CoV (or SARS-CoV-1), originated with a population of bats in a single cave persistently infected with what are known now as SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV). That cave, Shi and her colleagues reported, contained bats infected with at least 15 different SARSr-COVs, and this collection of viral material -- as a group -- contained all the necessary genetic components to create SARS-CoV-1.:SARS became a textbook example of ""zoonotic spillover,"" a model of emerging disease that typically requires a ""reservoir species"" of persistently infected animals (bats), an ""intermediate host"" that provides for the recombination of bat coronavirus with its own coronavirus material (civets sold in the wild animal trade, in the case of SARS), and a final host (humans involved in the trade) for whom the virus is, or evolves to become, both infectious and capable of causing disease.On Dec. 30, 2019, after weeks of Chinese authorities' suppressing relevant information, rumors of a new SARS outbreak first broke into the public sphere. That night, the Wuhan CDC sent samples taken from seven severe cases of what was then known as ""pneumonia of unknown etiology"" to Shi's lab at the WIV for identification. Early drafts of research about the new virus's genetics were published online in late January 2020. A final draft describing the full SARS-CoV-2 genome -- the virus's genetic code -- was published by her team on Feb. 3, 2020, in the journal Nature. Scientists and charlatans alike have been poring over those data to make arguments of varying strength ever since.Shi's team concluded that SARS-CoV-2 was 79% identical to SARS-CoV-1 and 96% identical to a virus her team had sampled from bats in a mineshaft in 2013. This information formed the basis of the widely accepted conclusion that SARS-CoV-2's ancestor was a bat virus. The portion of the new virus's genome that differed most from the bat virus was the portion that codes for its spike protein, which researchers noted was similar to the spike protein of a pangolin coronavirus, generating the now less widely accepted hypothesis that a pangolin served as an intermediate host.:Several elements of the lab leak hypothesis claim that SARS-CoV-2 is too well adapted to humans to be natural. But they also, by and large, focus myopically on RaTG13,  the virus collected by Shi in 2013 and subsequently found to be the most closely related to SARS-CoV-2. Authors of these pieces pose hypotheses that either explicitly or implicitly assume RaTG13 is a direct ancestor of SARS-CoV-2.RaTG13 Is Not a Direct Ancestor of SARS-CoV-2The conclusion that RaTG13 is 96% similar to this novel coronavirus is not evidence, despite its use as such by lab leak advocates, that SARS-CoV-2 evolved from RaTG13. From a basic and scientifically uncontroversial standpoint, it did not. Instead, the viruses that would eventually become SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 evolved from a shared viral ancestor separated by between 20 and 50 years of evolution.An April 2020 Medium post by Yuri Deigin, a ""serial entrepreneur"" and founder of a startup that seeks to ""defeat aging,"" is cited by several lab leak advocates including McNeil and Baker. In his piece, Deigin asserts that ""CoV2 is an obvious chimera ... based on the ancestral bat strain RaTG13."" In Deigin's scenario, RaTG13 -- either through laboratory manipulation or recombination in nature (the intermingling of viral genetic material in animals with multiple infections) -- acquired pangolin coronavirus spike genetics.:McNeil, in a Medium post cited by The Washington Post as lending new credibility to the lab leak theory, repeated this scenario, asking ""What if some Wuhan scientist did something like take the likely suspect virus RaBtCoV/4991 [RaTG13] and use it as the 'backbone' for a set of chimeras?"" Baker also proffered this argument in New York Magazine: ""New functional components may have been overlaid onto or inserted into the RaTG13 genome,"" he speculated. This argument has a fatal flaw: SARS-CoV-2 is not, as implied, the RaTG13 virus with a section of its genome swapped out. While RaTG13 is most dissimilar to SARS-CoV-2 in the spike region, its entire genome -- over 1000 nucleotide changes throughout -- diverges from SARS-CoV-2 in significant ways. When people such as Deigin write that SARS-CoV-2 is as if someone ""cut out"" a precise portion of pangolin genetics and ""inserted"" it into RaTG13, they are misrepresenting the data they cite.As University of Glasgow Professor David Robertson told HealthFeedback, ""You'd have to change these other parts of RaTG13's genome to arrive at SARS-CoV-2's sequence."" To lab leak advocates, this is no problem. They invoke vague claims about the potential for serial passage -- a method of genetic manipulation performed by sequentially passing a virus through cell lines or organisms that would not typically be capable of hosting that virus -- to ""speed up mutations."":""What if various such chimeras [including ones with RaTG13] were passaged through cultures of human cells or humanized mice? Wouldn't that speed up mutations into forms likely to infect humans even faster than nature can?"" Don McNeil wrote. This argument, and others that invoke serial passage, are entirely speculative. Their proponents cite no quantitative evidence to demonstrate such evolutionary distance could be made up by this mechanism, and the people qualified to address the plausibility of serial passage turning RaTG13 into SARS-CoV-2's backbone in quantitative terms say that it is not possible. Forcing RaTG13 into the role of direct ancestor to SARS-CoV-2 is also unnecessary, given what we now know about other SARS-CoV-2-related viruses.  While RaTG13 remains the closest genome to SARS-CoV-2 on average, at least three other bat viruses described since the onset of the pandemic are closer in large swaths of their genomes to SARS-CoV-2. This suggests that those viruses, with no connection to the WIV, are related to a more recent ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 than RaTG13.There is, however, an even more fundamental problem with the hypotheses presented above: They require an actual sample of a living RaTG13 specimen. There is no evidence that such a specimen has ever existed.:There Is No Evidence the Wuhan Institute of Virology 'Isolated' RaTG13Viruses sustain themselves only in an organism's cells. Without the protection and tools of a cell, coronavirus RNA rapidly degrades in the environment, breaking down into smaller non-functional bits of RNA.Several arguments in favor of a lab leak assert that the Wuhan Institute of Virology ""isolated"" the bat virus RaTG13. Isolating a virus is a process in which a fully functional virus -- the complete RNA genome -- is recovered from a sample containing large intact fragments of viral RNA or from a living specimen. Such a virus is then stored in compatible cell lines for use in later experimentation. This process results in a functional and potentially infectious virus kept in temperature-controlled storage.These processes differ fundamentally from the work of sequencing a virus sourced from fecal samples taken in the field. Such samples may contain, among other things, a slush of broken and non-infectious RNA strands potentially sourced from one or more coronaviruses. The reconstruction of a viral genome from a sample like this occurs within the confines of a computer after those RNA bits have been digitally converted into short strings of nucleotide code. The end result of this process is a file on a computer, not a physical specimen capable of being leaked anywhere.:Lab leak advocates have repeatedly blurred the crucial distinction between a sequenced viral sample and an isolated virus. For example, a June 2021 blog post written by Milton Leitenberg and published by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists claimed that the WIV ""possessed the virus that is the most closely related known virus in the world to the outbreak virus, bat virus RaTG13. This virus was isolated in 2013."" Baker, in New York Magazine, posited that ""this same virus [RaTG13] had been stored and worked on in the Wuhan Institute for years.""For what it's worth, Shi has stated that RaTG13 has never been isolated or cultured. Leitenberg attempted to cast doubt on that claim by declaring that ""knowledgeable virologists assume that the number must be much higher, probably hundreds of live viral isolates."" The footnote for this statement is a ""personal communication"" from an unknown individual.Some members of Trump's State Department, evidently, were similarly confused about the difference between viral sequences and viral cultures. In a memo released through a Freedom of Information Act request to Vanity Fair, former Assistant Secretary for International Security and Nonproliferation Christopher Ford summarized the conclusions derived from a panel of experts who met in January 2021 to discuss the lab leak scenario. In that document, he wrote::The assertion that WIV kept ""thousands of coronaviruses"" was also questioned in our discussion, since while it is true that WIV sequenced great numbers of viruses, such sequencing most commonly involves the possession of viral genomic material rather than live viruses ...One of the panelists also noted the incredible difficulty of isolating live virus from bat samples, which are usually fecal samples, and that this is extremely unreliable and usually not successful.It is impossible for Snopes or anyone else to prove the negative that lab leak advocates demand: that the WIV did not isolate and culture a virus from that 2013 sample. But stating as fact an unproven assertion without noting there is no evidence to support it is deceptive, especially when the totality of an argument depends upon that assertion being true.Still, proponents of many lab leak arguments can not quit RaTG13. Yet another talking point attempts to cast the location of this virus's discovery as evidence of the hand of the WIV in the evolution or spread of SARS-CoV-2.:The 2012 Mojiang Mine Incident's Scientific Significance Has Been DistortedIn reading virtually anything written about the lab leak hypothesis, what proponents identify as the ""most startling"" finding is that the RaTG13 virus was originally named Ra4991. This renaming, lab leak advocates allege, was done to obscure the sample's connection to a mineshaft in southern China where workers shoveling bat guano in 2012 became ill with SARS-like symptoms and died. As Shi has explained, the new name reflects the species of bat from which the virus was collected (Rhinolophus affinis), the location where it was collected (Tongguan) and the year of the sample's collection (2013).In an addendum to her SARS-CoV-2 genome paper published months later, Shi stated that these samples were collected after local authorities were concerned that the miners' cases could represent a novel animal-born virus. Shi's team (which was not the only group working at this site) sampled bat fecal samples once or twice a year from 2013 to 2015, collecting a total of 1,322 samples. Within those samples, Shi said in an interview with Science, nine were identified as containing betacoronaviruses, the family to which SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 belong. One of those betacoronavirus-containing samples was Ra4991.:The name change has been used to project suspicion onto Shi's work in the absence of clearly defined theories about its relevance. ""Rather than 'finding' RaTG13 in her freezers in February, Dr. Shi had worked with it since at least 2016, but under a different name, RaBtCoV/4991,"" McNeil wrote. ""This virus,"" he argued, using a strawman argument never presented by Shi, ""had not been gathered at random but from a mineshaft in which miners digging bat guano got pneumonia, some fatally.""Deigin, in his piece, made the same argument. ""It is odd that in her 2020 paper on RaTG13 Shi Zhengli fails to mention RaBtCoV/4991 or cite her 2016 paper about its discovery,"" he wrote. ""It is not like RaBtCoV/4991 was forgotten by her group, as it is mentioned in their 2019 paper, where it is included in a phylogenetic tree of other coronaviruses."" Finding things ""odd"" is not evidence; it is innuendo.Innuendo is all lab leak advocates have offered on this point. Most lab leak articles cite a translated Chinese master's thesis about the miners' illness as evidence of deception. This thesis argued that a SARS-like coronavirus may have been responsible for the deaths of the miners, but it found no definitive evidence in favor of that conclusion. In perhaps the least controversial statement of the lab leak debate, the authors who brought this translated thesis into the limelight concluded ""that the Mojiang mineshaft miners' illness could provide important clues to the origin of SARS-CoV-2."":Indeed it could, but that has nothing to do with the plausibility of a lab leak. While the conclusion is disputed, let's say for sake of argument that these miners died of a bat-borne coronavirus contracted in the mine as alleged (the presence of multiple viruses and other pathogens make any such a conclusion challenging and another team of researchers proposed a different kind of virus they identified in the same mine as the miners' cause of death in 2014). Such an occurrence would be evidence of a bat-borne virus similar to SARS-CoV-2 evolving to infect humans without any laboratory intervention.:(Science Magazine, March 2014)  Outside of absurdly involved and speculative claims involving the deceased miners' diagnostic samples being sent to the WIV and then used in undisclosed experiments, you would be hard-pressed to find an actual argument that specifically articulates why the discovery of this sample's changed name is suggestive of a laboratory leak. This could be, at least in part, because the mine represents a textbook example of a high-risk environment for zoonotic spillover.""Coronavirus co-infection was detected in all six bat species [found in the mine], a phenomenon that fosters recombination and promotes the emergence of novel virus strains,"" Shi's team reported in 2016. ""Our findings highlight the importance of bats as natural reservoirs of coronaviruses and the potentially zoonotic source of viral pathogens.""While it is entirely fair to ask why the sample's origin and history were not more clearly stated, theories seeking to make explicit links between the mine, the WIV, and COVID-19 -- when actually articulated -- make scientifically implausible arguments while ignoring the more obvious truth that this mine is a natural breeding ground for novel SARSr-CoVs and SARS-CoV2-related coronaviruses.:Whether the sample/virus is named Ra4991 or RaTG13, its central significance is that a virus that evolved naturally in bats is related, as a cousin, to SARS-CoV-2.SARS-CoV-2's Genome Does Not Contain ""Smoking Gun"" Proof of EngineeringMany formulations of the lab leak hypothesis do not specifically invoke RaTG13 but instead focus on the alleged improbability of a virus acquiring the adaptations it possesses naturally. The features most commonly cited as proof of human intervention relate to the spikes of SARS-CoV-2. To attach to a cell, the SARS-CoV-2 spike uses a receptor binding domain (RBD) to stick to an enzyme, ACE2, found on human cells. This feature is similar to how SARS-CoV-1 infects humans, and its genetic sequence appears to be a close match for RBDs in pangolin coronaviruses.To enter a cell, a coronavirus spike protein also must be ""cleaved"" into two halves. Unlike SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 can initiate the latter process using furin, a chemical found on a variety of human cells. For complex reasons, this adaptation allows the virus a faster and easier way to initiate cleaving in human lung tissue specifically. As respiratory infections spread easily through the air, such an adaptation makes SARS-CoV-2 much more transmissible than either SARS or MERS.:To lab leak advocates, such a fortuitous adaptation is allegedly unlikely to arise naturally. No other viruses in the group of viruses SARS-CoV-2 belong to have this adaptation, they argue, and such a fortuitous adaptation couldn't possibly come from mutations or recombination. Wade, for example, argued:Of all known SARS-related beta-coronaviruses, only SARS2 possesses a furin cleavage site. All the other viruses have their S2 unit cleaved at a different site and by a different mechanism. How then did SARS2 acquire its furin cleavage site? Either the site evolved naturally, or it was inserted by researchers at the S1/S2 junction in a gain-of-function experiment.This reasoning presents a misleadingly narrow view of coronavirus genetic diversity. While such furin cleavage sites are not present in the specific and likely under-sampled lineage of viruses that includes SARS, they are present all across the betacoronavirus family, including some that cause common colds in humans. Because this genetic feature occurs all across the coronavirus evolutionary tree and is not confined to one group, University of Utah virologist Stephen Goldstein told the scientific journal Nature, furin cleavage sites have likely evolved independently and naturally several times.:(Wu and Zhao 2021)The furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 arises thanks to a genetic sequence in the spike protein that contains something that has been dubbed a double CGG codon. (CGG is one of several genetic sequences that codes for the amino acid arginine.) It is, Wade argued, the least common method employed by coronaviruses to make arginine but a common way the human genome codes for it. On top of that, Wade states, CGG would be expected in a laboratory experiment, as the CGG codon is routinely used in such work.:The media granted this argument a great deal of support thanks to a quote from David Baltimore, a professor emeritus at the California Institute of Technology and a Nobel laureate. ""When I first saw the furin cleavage site in the viral sequence, with its arginine codons, I said to my wife it was the smoking gun for the origin of the virus,"" Baltimore said to Wade. ""These features make a powerful challenge to the idea of a natural origin for SARS2.""The idea presented by Wade is flawed, and Baltimore has since walked back his quote. The CGG arginine codon sequence appears in 3% of the full SARS-CoV-2's genome and 5% of  SARS-CoV-1's genome. It is literally possible for such arginine sequences to appear naturally in these viruses. In an essay titled ""When a Good Scientist Is the Wrong Source,"" MIT science writing professor Thomas Levenson declared that ""Baltimore certainly is an authority, but his jurisdiction does not extend to all the complexity that nature displays.""Speaking to the journal Nature in June 2021, Baltimore clarified that ""there are other possibilities and they need careful consideration, which is all I meant to be saying."" There is a great deal of distance between ""smoking gun"" proof of engineering and a conclusion that 'it's possible.' In other words, no ""smoking gun"" evidence of anything has been presented.:Further, the notion that those CGG-based sequences are de facto evidence of laboratory work has been contested by several scientists who point out that, in the cell lines commonly used for experiments at WIV and elsewhere, such sequences are selected against, making this specific cleavage site unlikely to be a result of a serial passage experiment gone wrong.The final class of arguments, therefore, relies on a narrow view of both COVID-19 pathogenesis and zoonotic spillover to cast the natural origin hypothesis as more unlikely than reality dictates.Lab Leak Advocates Present a Misleading Depiction of Natural Origin HypothesesLab leak advocates, in weighing the likelihood of zoonotic spillover, paint the absence of several features that characterized the earlier SARS and MERS outbreaks as evidence of unnatural origins. Scientists working on both of those diseases, lab leak advocates hold, rapidly identified the intermediate species providing the link between bat and human, and therefore should have by now done so with SARS-CoV-2.Wade, for example, argued that absence of an intermediate host ""was surprising because ... the intermediary host species of SARS1 was identified within four months of the epidemic's outbreak, and the host of MERS within nine months. Yet some 15 months after the SARS2 pandemic began ... Chinese researchers had failed to find either the original bat population, or the intermediate species to which SARS2 might have jumped.""First, while it is true that the intermediate hosts of both earlier coronavirus pandemics were identified quickly, it took 14 years to find ""the original bat population"" likely responsible for the SARS pandemic, and no such population has yet been identified for MERS. Second, an intermediate host -- if one is required to explain SARS-CoV-2's origins -- is often only transiently infected before the virus takes hold in humans. There may be a limited window of time in which it is even possible to identify a possible intermediate host.Finally, on that point, there is no actual requirement that an intermediate host exist in the first place. Bats can, in fact, infect humans without an intermediate species. Humans who live in regions close to populations of infected bats and have never directly interacted with bats or the caves they live in have been found to possess antibodies to bat coronaviruses. The existence of an intermediate host is not required to infect humans with bat coronaviruses, and the inability to locate one is not evidence of unnatural origins.Other arguments against a natural origin imply that it is somehow rare for anyone besides a virology researcher to come into contact with bats or to enter a cave or mine that houses them. ""Who else besides miners excavating bat guano comes into particularly close contact with bat coronaviruses?"" Wade argued. ""Coronavirus researchers do."" This is an absurd argument. First, one does not need to enter a bat colony to come into contact with a bat. Second, bat guano is commonly harvested in southern China for its use as a fertilizer. (The Huanan Market. Photo by Hector Retamal/AFP via Getty Images)A final allegedly problematic fact about SARS-CoV-2 is the distance between regions containing bats and Wuhan. ""If the SARS2 virus had first infected people living around the Yunnan caves, that would strongly support the idea that the virus had spilled over to people naturally. But this isn't what happened, "" Wade argued. ""The pandemic broke out 1,500 kilometers away, in Wuhan.""  Baker, similarly, suggested it is suspicious that ""the disease ... traveled from the bat reservoirs of Yunnan all the way to Wuhan, seven hours by train, without leaving any sick people behind and without infecting anyone along the way.""Proponents of this argument seem to feign ignorance about both how pandemics begin and how COVID-19 works while pretending that it is somehow unlikely for a human living in a rural part of southern China to pass through an important industrial city of 11 million people in the 21st century. Initial ""index cases"" representing a transfer from animal to human usually do not result in pandemic spread, and early spillover events likely would have evaded detection.Further, COVID-19 transmission is an enigmatic process driven, we know now, by undetected infections. Many people infected with SARS-CoV-2 do not show symptoms, and an estimated 50% of the disease's transmission occurs through asymptomatic or presymptomatic cases. This fact is what stymied early efforts to contact-trace COVID-19 cases, making it seem as though COVID-19 cases with no known contact to anyone infected appeared out of nowhere.To illustrate this, take COVID-19's emergence in the United States as an example. On Feb. 27, 2020, CNN reported that a ""patient in California who has coronavirus didn't travel anywhere known to have the virus [and] wasn't exposed to anyone known to be infected."" This alarming finding made international news, as it was the first case of ""community transmission"" in the United States confirmed by the CDC. In the absence of any other data, such a case would appear to have come out of nowhere, connected by no trail of infections and separated geographically from other known cases of COVID-19.Allegations that the distance between southern China's bat population and Wuhan are suspicious is born from a similar absence of data. It is likely, according to epidemiological models, that human-to-human transmission of the virus began in ""mid-October to mid-November"" 2019. Unpublished government records described by the South China Morning Post in March 2020 indicate that the earliest documented case of COVID-19, retroactively identified once COVID-19 tests were designed, first presented severe symptoms on Nov. 17, 2019. The international community simply does not have the data to argue that SARS-CoV-2's arrival in Wuhan -- if it came from elsewhere -- occurred ""without infecting anyone along the way.""Do any of these facts prove a natural origin? No. But arguments painting zoonotic origin as unlikely based on distance or lack of intermediate host mischaracterize what is known about the disease and limit, rhetorically, the conditions under which a natural origin might plausibly occur.The Bottom LineThe People's Republic of China has done itself no favors when it comes to its commitment to transparency or building international trust. Front-line doctors themselves connected the dots of several cases of suspicious pneumonia due to the shared connection to an animal market -- the Huanan market -- and its obvious parallels to the SARS outbreak. When these doctors attempted to raise an alarm internally, they were silenced and punished by Wuhan's health authorities.For example, Ai Fen, the director of Wuhan Central Hospital's emergency department, stated in an interview that went viral in China (despite being heavily censored by authorities) that ""she was told by superiors ... that Wuhan's health commission had issued a directive that medical workers were not to disclose anything about the virus, or the disease it caused, to avoid sparking a panic.""It is entirely fair to ask tough questions of China regarding both their coronavirus research and pandemic response. It is fair to demand access to data that could elucidate COVID-19's origins, including Chinese data on early cases of COVID-19 described in media reports and the full genomic sequences of the other unpublished SARS-related coronaviruses identified at the Mojiang mine.But these legitimate concerns over data transparency, laboratory safety, and bioethics have repeatedly been presented alongside wildly speculative and scientifically confused arguments that lack any evidentiary merit. These speculative scenarios have been presented in media reports as evidence, even though they rely on overt scientific misrepresentations or falsehoods.McNeil, for example, argues that we still have no definitive answers about where SARS-CoV-2 came from, but that ""the Occam's Razor argument -- what's the likeliest explanation, animal or lab? -- keeps shifting in the direction of the latter.""McNeil's piece, however, includes as evidence the work of Yuri Deigin, whose argument rests on the false assertion that ""CoV2 is ... based on the ancestral bat strain RaTG13."" It also cites the work of Milton Leitenberg, who conflates fecal swab samples with living viruses. And it relies on motivated reasoning of Nicholas Wade alleging the existence of ""smoking gun"" evidence for genetic manipulation. Stripped of these dubious arguments, the most prominent lab leak pieces have presented very little ""evidence"" that justifies such a shift in opinion.McNeil concedes that ""much of the debate comes down to this: Is Dr. Shi telling the whole truth? And even if she is, are all her similarly skilled colleagues in Wuhan?"" This is indeed the central crux of the debate. To suggest that the speculative, underdeveloped, or scientifically confused ""what-ifs"" posed in a series of self-referential blog posts constitutes scientific evidence capable of contributing to that debate, however, is deeply misleading.Snopes is still fighting an ""infodemic"" of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

But Snopes.com found that each of these pages can be tied to a radical evangelical activist named Kelly Monroe Kullberg, who is neither black nor Jewish. We found at least 24 pages in the Kullberg network, which could be in violation of Facebook's ban on ""coordinated inauthentic behavior."":Snopes also found that at least one prominent GOP donor, William Millis, funded and/or exploited the efforts of the Kullberg network. Millis was a fundraiser and campaign board member for current HUD Secretary Ben Carson's 2016 presidential campaign.Why does this matter? This network, and others that employ similar tactics, can affect online discourse in several ways:The network serves to influence public opinion by presenting the views of a small group of activists as representative of a much broader swath of the American populace.Their strategy amplifies and offers a veil of legitimacy to hatred and conspiracy theories.In spite of these strategies awash in misinformation, the pages within the network have attracted the financial backing of well-heeled political donors who exploit these pages and groups to disguise the origin of political Facebook ads.Facebook has not publicly commented on whether the Kullberg network violates their terms of service, but two posts we showed them (and no one else) were deleted after we reached out to the company for comment.:What do experts say?""Evangelical organizations are the primary funders of anti-Muslim animus.""

Follow our post-election coverage here.On Nov. 2, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump took to Twitter to rail against a United States Supreme Court decision allowing Pennsylvania election officials to accept mail-in ballots received several days after Election Day. Trump claimed, baselessly, that the decision could, ""induce violence in the streets.""Twitter slapped Trump's tweet with a warning that the information it contained ""is disputed and might be misleading"" about the imminent election. Twitter also limited the tweet's reach by axing the ability of other users to ""like"" or comment on it, and anyone choosing to share it received a pop-up carrying vetted information on mail-in voting: :The action taken by Twitter on Trump's tweet was a sign that the free-wheeling days of 2016, when armies of Russian government-controlled social media bots and trolls, political personalities, and media outlets, amplified misinformation in a campaign to influence the U.S., were over.The warning applied to Trump's tweet contains a link to Twitter's civic integrity policy which states in part:You may not use Twitter's services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. This includes posting or sharing content that may suppress participation or mislead people about when, where, or how to participate in a civic process. In addition, we may label and reduce the visibility of Tweets containing false or misleading information about civic processes in order to provide additional context.Despite these efforts, plenty of misinformation spread on social media on Election Day. For example, a troll impersonating a Pennsylvania poll worker created a hoax on Facebook-owned Instagram, claiming he had thrown out ballots for Trump. The post containing the false information was shared by various Trump supporters with large Twitter followings, including Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr.:Darren Linvill, an associate professor in communications at Clemson University who researches state-sponsored disinformation, told Snopes that yes, things are better in 2020 -- but the bar was set pretty low in 2016.""In 2016 the Russians were paying for Facebook ads with rubles,"" Linvill told us by phone. ""They were registering Twitter accounts with Russian phone numbers. [The platforms] were so blind in 2016."":But Linvill cautioned against giving too much credit to the platforms, noting that in terms of recent, major take-downs of foreign disinformation networks, ""We have the FBI to thank for that."" He added, ""It's a victory for everyone who's working in this space.""But now, Linvill said, there are more bad actors online than in 2016 -- many of them domestic. As an example, Linvill pointed to an October 2020 Facebook take-down of a network of trolls hired by the right-wing political action committee Turning Point Action. The trolls created profiles using fake names and profile pictures, and they commented on posts from mainstream media organizations and public figures ""to create the perception of widespread support of their narratives,"" Facebook's head of security, Nathaniel Gleicher, told Politico.Linvill also pointed to the fact that Scott Atlas, an adviser to Trump on the coronavirus pandemic, sat for an interview with Russian state-controlled media network RT. Atlas apologized for allowing himself to be ""taken advantage of,"" claiming he didn't know that RT was a registered as a foreign agent.:Come Election Day 2020, both Facebook and Twitter have mitigating measures which in and of themselves demonstrate that the 2020 election is an election like no other in recent history.Trump's Election DisinformationTrump has spent weeks making unfounded statements undermining people's trust in the process. Notably, he has baselessly and repeatedly claimed that mail-in ballots, which played a big roll in 2020 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, were vulnerable to widespread fraud.Trump has also refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden wins. Public officials and authorities are preparing for the possibility of political violence resulting surrounding the election.Additionally, Axios reported that Trump may further undermine the election process by prematurely declaring victory if early returns appear to favor him.:Social Networks' Policies Mitigate Potential UnrestBoth Facebook and Twitter have rules against a candidate claiming victory before results are final. They also have measures in place for the potentially uncertain days immediately following the election and rules against posts encouraging political violence.Twitter's policy against premature election victory declarations reads:People on Twitter, including candidates for office, may not claim an election win before it is authoritatively called. To determine the results of an election in the US, we require either an announcement from state election officials, or a public projection from at least two authoritative, national news outlets that make independent election calls. Tweets which include premature claims will be labeled and direct people to our official US election page.Facebook's policy states that the platform is prohibiting claims in ads that prematurely declare electoral victory and ads that, ""Attempt to delegitimize the election because the result cannot be determined on the final day of voting and/or before ballots are lawfully counted."":Additionally, Facebook stated:Getting the final election results this year may take longer than previous elections due to the pandemic and more people voting by mail. So we're preparing a range of policies and products to keep people informed and prevent the spread of misinformation.For example, when polls close, we will run a notification at the top of Facebook and Instagram and apply labels to candidates' posts directing people to the Voting Information Center for more information about the vote-counting process. But, if a candidate or party declares premature victory before a race is called by major media outlets, we will add more specific information in the notifications that counting is still in progress and no winner has been determined.On Election Day, Facebook said posts promoting ""poll watching"" activities ""when those calls use militarized language or suggest that the goal is to intimidate, exert control, or display power over election officials or voters"" are also not permitted.Once polls close, Facebook said it will keep users informed of the ballot counting process::""If presidential results aren't known for days or weeks, we will help people understand the ongoing process with notifications at the top of Facebook and Instagram, facts about voting from the Bipartisan Policy Center and curated news in News Feed and the VIC.""Additionally, Facebook said it is blocking ads from foreign state-controlled media outlets.Twitter and Facebook both said they prohibit posts inciting violence. Per Twitter:""Tweets meant to incite interference with the election process or with the implementation of election results, such as through violent action, will be subject to removal. This covers all Congressional races and the Presidential Election.""Linvill said that despite the platforms' efforts, disinformation that doesn't break the law or violate rules can still easily spread. RT and Sputnik, another Russian government-owned outlet, still spread disinformation online. And followers of the dangerous QAnon conspiracy theory still thrive on the platforms, despite recent enforcement actions against it.:""The flip side [to the social media platforms' efforts] is that there are a lot more bad actors than there used to be,"" Linvill said. ""In 2016 it was just the Russians and a few outliers. Now you've got Russian, Cuban, Chinese, a lot of Iranian [influencing efforts]. And, just a whole bunch of domestic stuff. We're our biggest problem."""

624,624,77.ShootingatFederalJud,"After a shooting at a federal judge's home in New Jersey on July 18, 2020 -- which left her son dead and her husband wounded -- speculation arose that the incident was the result of a conspiracy involving disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was found dead in his jail cell in August 2019.Some took to social media to express suspicion that the shooting was an assassination attempt on U.S. District Judge Esther Salas, who days before the incident was assigned to preside over a lawsuit by investors accusing Deutsche Bank of misleading them about ""anti-money-laundering deficiencies"" and failing to ""properly monitor"" customers considered ""high risk,"" such as Epstein. A few examples of such social media post can be viewed below::At this time there is not enough publicly available information to determine all of the motives of the primary suspect in the attack, Roy Den Hollander.The shooter reportedly disguised himself as a FedEx deliveryman, fatally shot Salas' 20-year-old son and seriously wounded her husband, 63. Salas was in a different part of the family's New Brunswick home and was unharmed.:We sent a question about motive for the shooting to the FBI, which is investigating the case, and haven't heard back in time for publication.News reports point to Den Hollander's personal hatred for Salas and his track history of being an ""anti-feminist"" lawyer who ""flooded the courts with seemingly frivolous lawsuits that sought to eliminate women's studies programs and prohibit nightclubs from holding 'ladies' nights.'""Den Hollander expressed hatred for Salas after one of his recent cases came before her, calling her ""a lazy and incompetent Latina judge appointed by Obama"" in a self-published book. He was also reportedly suffering from terminal cancer, according to various news reports.After the shooting at Salas' home, police found Den Hollander near Liberty, New York, dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.Days before the shooting, Salas had been been assigned a case in which investors sued Deutsche Bank for damages over lost share value, alleging the bank failed to properly monitor risky clients like Epstein and also failed to disclose all relevant information to investors.:Because Epstein was a convicted sex offender, known for both fraternizing with and allegedly procuring sex trafficking victims for high-profile and powerful people, it is not unusual for his name to inspire suspicion and speculation. Many disbelieve the official explanation that his death in jail while awaiting trial on related sex trafficking charges was a suicide, claiming instead he was murdered as part of a cover-up.Epstein's longtime companion, Ghislaine Maxwell, was arrested on July 2 on charges related to sex trafficking of children and is in custody awaiting trial."
625,625,685.EyewitnessTestimonyC,"Claim:Eyewitness testimony confirms that there was a second shooter during the Parkland, Florida school shooting on 14 February 2018.Rating:FalseAbout this rating The conspiracy internet is extremely predictable in the wake of horrific national tragedies. One of the most common claims made in this cynical, opportunistic online world is the nebulous assertion of a ""second shooter"" during mass shootings, often associated with suggestions of a nefarious but wholly undefined government cover-up or plot.:Far-right conspiracy theorist and InfoWars founder Alex Jones has proposed the existence of a second shooter at the October 2017 Las Vegas shooting, 2016's Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando, and the Aurora movie theatre shooting -- to give just a small (but entirely representative) fraction of his analyses. In his click-driven world, the recent Parkland school shooting is no different. The day after the shooting, Jones' site, Infowars.com, reported:Eyewitness Alexa Miednik, who believes there was a second shooter, said she was WALKING with accused suspect Nikolas Cruz (who the media previous spelled as Nicolas) after she heard shots being fired - and told Cruz she was glad ""it wasn't him"" who was doing the shooting at the school in Florida.This is a factual summary of an account of the shooting given to KHOU sports reporter Matt Musil, who was on assignment in Florida covering the Houston Astros training camp at the time of the shooting. During that interview, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student said that she walked out of the school with the (admitted) shooter after the shooting had occurred, remarking to him that ""I'm surprised you [Cruz] weren't the one who did it."":Because she saw him after the shooting, she told Musil, she figured there had to be a second shooter if Cruz was involved:Musil: Oh, you think he was not the only one?Student: No, definitely not.Musil: Why do you say that?Student: Because when shots were fired, I saw him after the fact, so the shots were coming from the other part of the building, so there definitely had to be two shooters involved, I believe.That belief notwithstanding, the student's account is fully consistent with the story Cruz gave to police and the other official accounts of the event. As stated in his arrest warrant, Cruz ditched his gun after the shooting and slipped out of the crowd as one of the hundreds of fleeing students -- a scenario consistent with the student's report.Cruz also admitted that as students began to flee the campus on foot he decided a plan to discard his AR-15 and vest with the additional magazines so he could blend into the crowd. Once the crime scene was secured, the discarded AR-15 rifle and vest -- with magazines -- was found in areas consistent with Cruz's version of events.:This is, as a matter of fact, the reason it took so long before police could detain the suspect, causing a lengthy period of uncertainty about his whereabouts. He was eventually caught away from the scene of the crime ""after buying a drink at a Subway restaurant,"" according to USA Today.Infowars.com later identified a second student's testimony purportedly referencing a second shooter. That testimony, given by a student who was interviewed by multiple outlets and who appeared in at least one television news segment, comes with an understandable lack of clarity given the frantic nature of the interviews and their immediacy with respect to the event itself. Her answers are filled with ambiguous pronouns making it possible for people like Jones to sow doubt and build their own meaning out of the confusion. In one of those videos, a reporter asked if there was a second shooter, but her answer (which actually cuts off the end of the reporter's question) is further muddled by the sound of a vehicle in the background:Reporter: Do you think there was more than one shoot --Student: There were three [shootings?/shooters?] that's what I heard...:It is unclear if the student, who was responding to a sea of reporters directly after a horrific, violent attack, meant she heard three different bursts of gunfire (Cruz brought multiple magazines to the school in a backpack according to the warrant), or if she heard evidence that there were ""three shooters"" (one more, it bears mentioning, than Infowars.com had been alleging).In any event, throughout the rest of that interview, and in interviews with numerous other outlets, she repeatedly refers to the shooter as a single male person, using the words ""he"" and ""him"" to refer to the person perpetrating the murders.Jones and his ilk use this kind of first-hand, ambiguous, in-the-moment information to sow doubt about the ""official"" narrative given by the ""mainstream media."" This allows them to raise, but not demonstrate, the specter of a nefarious government plot to steal the American populace's guns -- that ""false flag"" argument that is in vogue on conspiracy websites these days.Jones made this connection explicit in a 15 February 2018 segment on his podcast::Wow, we said the perfect false flag would be a white nationalist attacking a multicultural school as a way to make the leftists all look like victims and bring in gun control and a war on America's recovery and now right on time what we've been warning of, their main card, the thing we said was imminent, appears with all the evidence.The fact of the matter is that while these videos may not offer complete clarity, they are far from proof of anything that goes against the official narrative presented by police and admitted to by the perpetrator himself.The primary interview used to make the argument of a second shooter tells a story wholly consistent with the actions of the single shooter, if -- as Cruz later testified -- he escaped along with the crowd. The second interview is far too ambiguous to allow anyone to draw definitive conclusions, and it could also just as convincingly be interpreted as evidence of a single shooter. As such, we rank claims of eyewitness accounts confirming a second shooter as false."
626,626,614.DidRepMarjorieTaylor,"Claim:U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia speculated that the real culprit behind the November 2018 wildfires in California may have been a Jewish laser beam from space.Rating:MixtureAbout this rating What's TrueIn a now-deleted Facebook post, Greene suggested that laser beams from space may have started the 2018 California wildfires, and that among the entities behind this conspiracy were former California Gov. Jerry Brown, Pacific Gas & Electric, and Rothschild Inc., an investment firm frequently targeted by anti-Semitic conspiracy theorists. What's FalseGreene did not explicitly state that ""Jewish space lasers"" caused the fires. :Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from Georgia has courted controversy on various issues by promoting QAnon conspiracy theories, alongside a history of anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic remarks. Years-old views, including a Facebook interaction in which she agreed with a comment that the Parkland shooting was a ""false flag"" staged event, and a video in which she pushed 9/11 conspiracy theories, have been unearthed.One post from 2018 in particular was reported on by Media Matters for America, a watchdog group, where she speculated about a conspiracy surrounding the November 2018 wildfires in California. In the now-deleted post, Greene theorized that a space-based solar generator, used in a clean-energy experiment with the goal of replacing coal and oil, could have beamed the sun's energy back to Earth and started the fires. We have covered similar claims surrounding the wildfires before.She said, ""there are too many coincidences to ignore"" and ""oddly there are all these people who have said they saw what looked like lasers or blue beams of light causing the fires.""::Greene also speculated that a range of people or groups were involved in this fire, including former California Gov. Jerry Brown, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), and Rothschild Inc., an investment firm.She said that Roger Kimmel, who was on the board of PG&E, was also ""Vice Chairman of Rothschild Inc,"" and ""If they are beaming the suns energy back to Earth, I'm sure they wouldn't ever miss a transmitter receiving station right??!! I mean mistakes are never made when anything new is invented. What would that look like anyway? A laser beam or light beam coming down to Earth I guess. Could that cause a fire? Hmmm, I don't know. I hope not! That wouldn't look so good for PG&E, Rothschild Inc, Solaren or Jerry Brown who sure does seem fond of PG&E.""The Rothschilds, a Jewish banking family, have long been the targets of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories claiming that Jewish people are in control of the entire world. While Greene specifically did not use the words ""Jewish space laser,"" she heavily implied that the Rothschilds were involved in the laser conspiracy.:An investigation showed that the California wildfires of 2018 were ignited by PG&E power lines, and then spread with the help of warm temperatures, dry vegetation, and strong winds.In late January 2021, CNN reported that dozens of posts from 2018 and 2019 had been removed from Greene's Facebook page. Given that Greene did not directly state that ""Jewish lasers"" caused the fires, but did speculate that laser beams somehow connected to the Rothschild investment firm were a cause, we rate this claim as ""Mixture."""
627,627,494.IsDominionSubsidiary,"Claim:A member of U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's transition team, Peter Neffenger, served as chairman of Dominion Voting's ""subsidiary,"" Smartmatic.Rating:Mostly FalseAbout this rating What's TruePeter Neffenger, a U.S. Coast Guard admiral, former chief of the Transportation Security Administration, and chairman of Smartmatic's board of directors, is a member of one agency review team aiding Biden's transition to the White House. What's FalseNeffenger is not the chairman of Dominion Voting Systems. Smartmatic is a competitor, not a subsidiary, of Dominion. :Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.In the wake of the U.S. presidential election in November 2020, a series of unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud were circulated by U.S. President Donald Trump and his supporters in an apparent attempt to sow distrust in the integrity of the election and cast doubt on President-elect Joe Biden's victory. Many of these rumors centered on Dominion Voting Systems, a company that provides election software to several counties around the United States.We have already debunked a number of these rumors (no, Dominion did not delete millions of votes; no, the company is not owned or funded by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi or Hillary Clinton; no, a ""glitch"" did not switch votes from Trump to Biden), but new wrinkles are continuously being added to this conspiracy theory.One recent rumor claimed that a member of Biden's transition team, Peter Neffenger, sat on the board of Dominion Voting Systems' ""subsidiary"" Smartmatic:::There are a few kernels of truth to this claim. Neffenger, a U.S. Coast Guard admiral and former administrator of the Transportation Security Administration, is a member of one of the agency review teams aiding Biden's transition to the White House. Neffenger is also the chairman of Smartmatic's board of directors. However, Smartmatic is a competitor of Dominion, not a subsidiary. Eddie Perez, a voting technology expert at the Open Source Election Technology (OSET) Institute, a nonpartisan election technology research and development nonprofit, told The Associated Press that there is no connection between the two companies. Perez said: ""It appears that Mr. (Rudy) Giuliani is making some wild and unfounded claims that are connecting the dots between companies that appear to be unrelated.""Smartmatic and Dominion have also both published statements to address these rumors. Both companies noted that they are competitors in the election space and do not have any financial interests in the other's success. :In November 2020, Smartmatic published a ""response to misinformation"" to address some of the claims that had been circulating about the company. Smartmatic wrote:In the aftermath of the 2020 general election, there has been a great deal of misinformation being circulated about Smartmatic and other companies that provide election technology to voting jurisdictions in the US. We would like to dispel these incorrect statements with facts.Smartmatic has never owned any shares or had any financial stake in Dominion Voting Systems.Smartmatic has never provided Dominion Voting Systems with any software, hardware or other technology. The two companies are competitors in the marketplace.In another article, Smartmatic addressed some additional claims that circulated in the wake of the 2020 election. We reproduced the portions of the text relevant to this topic below::Does Smartmatic own any other voting machine company?No.Has Smartmatic owned any voting machine company in the USA?Smartmatic owned Sequoia Voting systems and sold it in 2007.Is Smartmatic's software used in other company's voting machines?No. Smartmatic's software is not licensed or otherwise used by other companies.Were Smartmatic voting machines used in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, or North Carolina?No. None of these states used Smartmatic technology.Is Smartmatic allied with any political parties?No. Smartmatic has no ties to political parties or groups in any country. Smartmatic's employees are required to adhere to a strict ethics code that, among other things, prohibits them from making political donations.Does George Soros have any involvement in Smartmatic?No. George Soros has never had any ownership stake in, or involvement with, Smartmatic. This fact was confirmed again by The New York Times on November 3, 2020. :Dominion, too, has addressed these rumors. DOMINION IS NOT, AND HAS NEVER BEEN, OWNED BY SMARTMATIC.Dominion is an entirely separate company and a fierce competitor to Smartmatic.Dominion and Smartmatic do not collaborate in any way and have no affiliate relationships or financial ties. Dominion does not use Smartmatic software.The only associations the companies have ever had were:In 2009, Smartmatic licensed Dominion machines for use in the Philippines. The contract ended in a lawsuit.In 2010, Dominion purchased certain assets from Sequoia, a private U.S. Company. Smartmatic, a previous owner of Sequoia, pursued legal actions against Dominion.It should also be noted that, while Neffenger is technically a member of Biden's transition team, this does not mean that he has landed a future position in the White House. In fact, Neffenger is only listed as a ""volunteer,"" as opposed to a ""detailee"" or a ""full-time transition employee,"" with the advisory team dealing with Homeland Security. Here is how Biden's ""Build Back Better"" website describes the purpose of agency review teams::Agency review teams are responsible for understanding the operations of each agency, ensuring a smooth transfer of power, and preparing for President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris and their cabinet to hit the ground running on Day One.

628,628,562.PoliceInterviewRoomS,"Claim:   Video shows a suspect in a police shooting committing suicide in an interview room.TRUEExample:   [Collected via e-mail, 2004]Is this video real?GRAPHIC IMAGE WARNING: Video shows a suicide by gunshot.:   Origins:    Movies and television have planted sensationalized images of certain phenomena into the public consciousness, to the extent that when most of us see the real thing, we're disappointed that it seems so mundane.  In films and television programs, automobile crashes are always slam-bang affairs that inevitably end with one or more cars bursting into flame and exploding; thunder is always a very loud, sharp, and short report which occurs simultaneously with a bolt of lightning (rather than a slow, distant, gradually increasing rumbling which arrives well after the lightning flash); and gunshots are usually depicted as producing ear-splitting volumes of sound and, when aimed at another human being, resulting in plenty of gore and splatter.It's no wonder, then, that when the above-displayed video of a detainee shooting himself while in police custody began to circulate, many viewers were skeptical of its authenticity -- by Hollywood standards, it's so tame as to be almost surreal.   As depicted in the video, an uncuffed suspect enters an interrogation room and sits down in a chair, followed by an officer who dumps some keys and sunglasses on a table, checks his cell phone, and leaves the room momentarily.  The officer returns several seconds later with a bottle of water and a cup of coffee, then hands the water bottle to the suspect, checks his cell phone again, picks up the coffee, and exits the room a second time -- leaving the suspect alone and unrestrained, and the door open.  The suspect takes a couple of swigs of water, then calmly reaches into his pants with his other hand, pulls out a large-caliber handgun, and shoots himself in the left temple.:But what we see in the video is nothing like what most of us might expect.  The soon-to-be suicide victim is neither visibly nervous nor distraught as he freely pulls out a gun and places it against his head.  (He even replaces the cap on the water bottle before pulling the trigger.)  The weapon does not produce an ear-shattering concussive sound in the small room, blood and brain matter don't splatter all over the walls, and the victim's body isn't hurtled out of the chair and onto the floor.  The gun makes a sharp popping sound as the suspect shoots himself, blood streams from the victim's head and mouth, his hands drop the gun and water bottle to the floor, and his body slumps but slightly in the chair.:Even more unusual to many viewers is the officer's reaction to this event.  He doesn't respond with any of the emotions most of us might feel, such as fear, panic, terror, or disgust.  Nor does he rush to the victim's aid, check him for signs of life, summon help, or otherwise raise an alarm.  ""Oh, fuck,"" he exclaims as he re-enters the room, puts his coffee down on the table, and surveys the scene for a second or two, then adds ""Holy fuck.""  When a second (unseen) officer inquires  ""What did he do?"" he responds with, ""Nobody shook him"" (i.e., nobody searched the suspect for weapons), then calmly retrieves the keys and sunglasses and leaves the room.  Throughout the short video, the officer's actions seem almost nonchalant: he doesn't act the least bit shocked or horrified that a human being has just died a violent death right in front of him. Instead, the foremost thought on his mind seems to be concern that someone's going to get into big trouble for the oversight of allowing a detainee to retain a weapon.(We realize, of course, that all of this would be viewed quite differently from a police perspective.  Officers undergo thorough instruction in the handling and use of firearms, they generally see far more blood and violence on the job than most of us will experience in our lifetimes, and they're trained to respond to emergency situations by following proper procedure rather than reacting with fear or panic.  We're simply presenting the average person's reaction to this video, as reflected in the e-mail we've received from readers who have viewed it.):The circumstances behind this video took place on 19 December 2003, when 47-year-old Ricardo Alfonso Cerna was stopped for a traffic violation at about 9:30 A.M. in Muscoy (a residential suburb of San Bernardino County, about 60 miles east of Los Angeles).  Cerna fled the scene (in his car and then on foot) before shooting the pursuing officer, sheriff's deputy Michael Parham, twice in the abdomen.  (Deputy Parham survived the shooting.)   Cerna was soon arrested by San Bernardino police and taken to sheriff's headquarters on Third Street, where he was placed in an interview room just before 11 A.M. in preparation for questioning by Bobby Dean, head of the San Bernardino County sheriff's homicide unit.  When Dean stepped out of the room briefly to speak with a detective in the hallway, Cerna pulled the .45-caliber handgun out of his pants and shot himself in the head.  Evidently a chain of mistakes led to Cerna, a shooting suspect, being taken into custody without either the arresting officers or the booking officers discovering he had a large, heavy handgun concealed on his person:[Sheriff Gary] Penrod said deputies failed to adequately search Cerna before he was put in a car, and again when he was transferred to the homicide division office. Each receiving deputy may have wrongly assumed the previous officer adequately searched the man, he said. Penrod said confusion among the three agencies involved -- the Highway Patrol, San Bernardino police and the Sheriff's Department -- may have contributed to the oversight.""Obviously there was a mistake made,"" Penrod said by phone. ""It was hectic and it was a guy who was cuffed by somebody other than the transporting officer.:(This apparently egregious oversight led to conspiracy-theory speculation in some quarters that Cerna had been ""executed"" by the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department, or that the sheriff returned the gun to Cerna and urged him to commit suicide with it -- the completely implausible scenario of officers' deliberately handing a loaded gun to a suspect who had already shot one policeman notwithstanding.)As to how the video of Cerna's suicide made it onto the Internet, sheriff's spokesman Chip Patterson said: [A] ranking official at the department was authorized to show the video during a presentation on officer safety at the FBI's training academy in Quantico, Va., several months ago.Following the presentation, dozens of copies of the video were made at the request of law-enforcement agencies across the country. Officials of those agencies wanted the copies for training purposes.Sheriff's officials do not know who might have leaked the video to the public.  Some of the officers involved in Cerna's arrest and handling were subjected to disciplinary action, but sheriff's officials wouldn't comment on the specifics of that action or identify the officers involved. :Last updated:   19 January 2014Sources:     Grenda, Tim and Imran Ghori.

630,630,554.WasGlobalWarmingData,"Claim:NASA and NOAA faked climate data in the GISTEMP global temperature record to exaggerate global warming. Rating:FalseAbout this rating Since 2014, climate-change deniers have squeezed millions of views, Facebook shares, and Twitter retweets by retelling a story alleging the discovery of ""faked"" NASA data designed to ""fit a climate change narrative."" Though copied almost wholesale from a blog post, the version of the story that has had the most online traction was published on the one-stop conspiracy theory/supplement shop that goes by the name Natural News. The article suggested::In what might be the largest scientific fraud ever uncovered, NASA and the NOAA have been caught red-handed altering historical temperature data to produce a ""climate change narrative"" that defies reality. [...] We now know that historical temperature data for the continental United States were deliberately altered by NASA and NOAA scientists in a politically-motivated attempt to rewrite history and claim global warming is causing U.S. temperatures to trend upward.There is a lot to unpack here, but the first thing you need to know is records of global surface temperatures are constantly refined based on the addition of new data, fresh statistical analyses, or new historical insight into the history of a specific source of data. Reporting on such a shift as something to ""uncover"" betrays a potentially willful ignorance of how climate science operates. These changes are publicly reported, based on stated scientific criteria, and subjected to rigorous internal and external peer review.Where is this coming from?:The ""smoking gun"" concerns a climate record known as the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP). These records are based on a massive global dataset of temperature stations from around the world, combining several collections of data originally collected by individual weather stations. The record provides ""a measure of the changing global surface temperature with monthly resolution for the period since 1880, when a reasonably global distribution of meteorological stations was established.""To argue for evidence of ""faked"" data, Natural News, as well as the original blog post, highlighted a version of the GISTEMP record for the United States first published in 1999, comparing it to one published later, in 2012. The record, these sources point out, has shifted::(These charts plot how far off each year's average U.S. temperature differs from the average temperature for the entire period 1951-1980; the frame labeled ""a"" is from 1999.)It should be no shock that the data shifted following 1999, as illustrated graphically in the above diagram, because NASA published multiple papers in 1999 and 2001 about these changes and why they were made. Links to these papers can be found on the NASA website, which also publicly summarizes the changes in several other places.Why adjust climate data?Writing for the climate information website Skeptical Science, Berkeley Earth research scientist Zeke Hausfather, whose work (in part) independently analyzes adjustments made by government agencies' climate records, explained the need for making adjustments to such datasets in general. A primary misconception, he argues, is that an ""unadjusted global temperature record"" -- which necessarily has to take into account not only the temperature reading at a given recording station, but also how to translate that data spatially to come up with a single annual or monthly number -- is not really a thing that exists to begin with::There are a number of folks who question the need for adjustments at all. Why not just use raw temperatures, they ask, since those are pure and unadulterated? The problem is that ... there is really no such thing as a pure and unadulterated temperature record. Temperature stations in the U.S. are mainly operated by volunteer observers (the Cooperative Observer Network, or co-op stations for short). Many of these stations were set up in the late 1800s and early 1900s as part of a national network of weather stations, focused on measuring day-to-day changes in the weather rather than decadal-scale changes in the climate.Nearly every single station in the network in the network has been moved at least once over the last century, with many having 3 or more distinct moves. Most of the stations have changed [the type of instruments used]. Observation times have shifted from afternoon to morning at most stations since 1960, as part of an effort by the National Weather Service to improve precipitation measurements.So what were the issues that led to changes between the 1999 record and the later record? According to NASA's GISTEMP website, ""Starting in the 1990s, the methodology took into account documented non-climatic biases in the raw data and eliminated or corrected unrealistic outliers."" The goal of these adjustments is to remove shoddy data from the dataset using pre-established methodologies, not to fit a ""climate change narrative."":These ""non-climatic biases"" include things like stations taking temperature measurements at different times of day, stations physically moving locations (sometimes to a different elevation), and other artifacts that produce change in a record not attributable to climate or weather. These non-climatic biases were identified and their method of adjustment described in a publicly available 2001 paper found, among other places, on NASA's website. They included:Time of observation: Not all stations collect observations at the same time, and some stations -- most significantly in the United States -- have changed the time at which data is collected over time. Correcting for these effects is the most significant adjustment made to the GISTEMP dataset post-1999.Station location history: Sometimes stations move to another location, affecting the record. Post-1999 records take this into account.Change in thermometer type: A well-defined shift in data came from a change from liquid-in-glass thermometers to the maximum-minimum temperature system (MMTS). Post-1999 records take this into account.Urban heat effect: Densely populated urban areas retain heat more than rural areas. An increase in stations in urban areas over time, for example, would create a false warming trend. Post 1999 records take this into account as well.:Additionally, post-1999 GISTEMP records employ models to fill in areas with missing data to make a more complete record from a spatial perspective. The methods used and their effect on the data are all disclosed online. However the issues described above are largely moot at the time of this writing in 2019. The GISTEMP analyses at issue above concern a formulation of the dataset (GISTEMP v3) that has been replaced by an improved model named GISTEMP v4, which includes a much larger set of data and a whole other set of adjustments.""Caught red-handed""All told, the most significant effect of all these changes came from the time-of-day adjustments. Collectively, the adjustments served to produce a slightly increased warming trend in the United States record compared to the earlier records.The largest adjustments are the time of observation debiasing and station history adjustment, each of which increases the mean warming over the United States by about 0.15oC over the 100 years. The net of all five adjustments to the ... record is a warming of about 0.3oC:To suggest -- 14 years after the fact -- that identifying publicly discussed adjustments to raw data whose methods have been published in peer-reviewed journals represents catching scientists ""red-handed"" in ""the largest scientific fraud ever uncovered"" exposes only the ignorance of the author, not some nefarious sleight of hand by climate scientists. As such, the claim is rated ""False."""

And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. :In mid-July 2021, Stew Peters, a conservative internet talk show host who has a track record for spreading COVID-19 vaccine misinformation, used his show on the video platform Rumble to spread more COVID-19 vaccine misinformation.Snopes readers emailed us asking about a post seen on Facebook from a Qanon conspiracy theory website containing the headline, ""VIDEO: HORRIFIC! - FIVE Jet Blue Airlines Pilots DEAD, Media Intentionally Hiding Vaxx Fears."" The post contained a link to Peters' show.During that July 16 show, Peters and his guest Dr. Jane Ruby (who is not a medical doctor) claimed that five JetBlue pilots died as a result of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine shot. But oddly Ruby also admitted she didn't know whether any of the pilots mentioned even received the shot. (We added bold text to the key portion of the quote below):This is another bombshell, an airline we have not heard about or from yet. It's JetBlue. A pilot has come forward who's still actively in the company to let us know that five JetBlue pilots passed away between February of this year and May. There's no direct information yet about their jab status. But he, this pilot does acknowledge that the company is keeping that kind of thing very quiet.:Ruby then goes on to name five JetBlue employees who died between February and May of 2021. JetBlue has about 20,000 employees.In company marketing materials, JetBlue said it encouraged employees to get vaccinated and that the ""majority"" of crew members had received the vaccine.In obituaries found online for the JetBlue employees named by Ruby, two mentioned the cause of death. In those cases, the deaths had nothing to do with COVID-19 or the vaccine. One pilot died in a UTV accident. Another died of cancer.In a statement emailed to Snopes, JetBlue acknowledged that four pilots died in 2021. One employee named by Ruby wasn't a pilot, but an inflight crew member. The company called the video an effort to intentionally mislead the public:JetBlue is aware of a report that mentions four of our pilots and one inflight crewmember who have passed away this year. While we mourn their loss, there is no connection in their deaths or to the COVID-19 vaccine. The social media video appears designed to intentionally deceive the public and should not be considered a trusted source of information.:The claim that five JetBlue ""pilots"" died from the vaccine echoes a similar claim about British Airways. That claim was also false and used the same method of apparently trawling the internet for people from the same airline company who died in prior months, then claiming without evidence they died from the vaccine.Peters and Ruby had previously taken to the show to claim that the vaccines were injected magnets into people, a claim that spectacularly backfired in an attempted live demonstration that went viral::We are rating this claim ""False"" because it comes from an unreliable source with a track record for spreading misinformation, and by the source's own admission, there is insufficient evidence to support the claim. We also note that the evidence that is available -- namely the cause of death in two of the five cases -- directly contradicts the claim."
632,632,533.ObamaPlansClintonInd,"Almost from the moment Barack Obama was elected to the U.S. presidency in November 2008, conspiracy mongers began positing methods by which he would seek to remain in power once his term of office expired -- everything from fomenting a ""national emergency"" that would provide him with an excuse for cancelling elections to declaring martial law and suspending the Constitution to (somehow single-handedly) altering the Constitution to remove its presidential two-term limit.In August 2016 Joseph Farah, editor of the notoriously unreliable WND web site, tossed a new scenario into the third-term conspiracy mix: President Obama's ordering a strategically delayed indictment of putative President-Elect Hillary Clinton over charges related to her using position as Secretary of State to solicit donations to the Clinton Foundation.  This, according to Farah, would create a ""constitutional crisis"" that would disqualify Clinton from holding office and enable President Obama to remain in the White House past the expiration of his term of office:[T]here is another possibility, even more sinister, perhaps. Suppose -- just suppose now -- that Obama is hedging his bets. What if he is actually using this FBI and this Injustice Department to do a real investigation intended to maintain his position as president? I have previously speculated, and that's all it is I admit openly, pure informed speculation, that Obama has not completely abandoned the idea of remaining president past Jan. 20, 2017. :So what if -- and it's a big ""if"" -- Obama is holding something back? Suppose he has actually authorized a probe of what she did as secretary of state to benefit herself and the Clinton Foundation.Is it possible he might use the findings -- and, believe me, they are not hard to find -- to indict her between Election Day and Jan. 17, while he is still president?If she is indicted on serious charges, she will not be permitted to take the oath of office. Neither will Tim Kaine be permitted to assume the office of the president because he will not yet be vice president.The whole thing will create a constitutional crisis. The next in line, House Speaker Paul Ryan, will not be allowed to assume the presidency, either, because there is a sitting president.If this admittedly unlikely and far-fetched scenario occurs, it will demonstrate that Obama has been planning it for quite some time. That's why I'm telling you about the remote possibility now.:Like much of what Farah and WND publish, this scenario ignores how things actually work in favor of promulgating a sensational and politically slanted conspiracy theory.No provision of the U.S. Constitution states that a person who is under indictment is ineligible to run for, be elected to, or hold the office of President of the United States.  In fact, no provision of that document disqualifies from the presidency a person who is currently on trial, has been convicted, or is serving prison time.  (Indeed, in 1920 Socialist Party candidate Eugene V. Debs campaigned for the presidency from the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, where he had been incarcerated for violating the Espionage Act, and captured 3.41% of the popular vote.)The U.S. Constitution does allow for the impeachment and removal from office of civil officers --  including the President and Vice President -- but only for crimes committed while in office, not  for acts undertaken prior to assuming office.Moreover, President Obama's term of office expires at noon on 20 January 2017, period.  It makes no difference whether or not a living, eligible, duly elected successor is on hand to immediately assume the presidency -- there is no constitutional provision for Barack Obama to remain in office past that date.:Farah's narrative doesn't even make logical sense (not even for a far-fetched conspiratorial political imagining), positing that it a ""constitutional crisis"" would be triggered by the following series of events:If [Clinton] is indicted on serious charges, she will not be permitted to take the oath of office. Neither will Tim Kaine be permitted to assume the office of the president because he will not yet be vice president.The whole thing will create a constitutional crisis. The next in line, House Speaker Paul Ryan, will not be allowed to assume the presidency, either, because there is a sitting president.As long as there is a ""sitting president,"" all of this is irrelevant. The status of the President-elect isn't an issue until the term of the current President expires, so it's nonsensical to say that the Vice President or the House Speaker ""would not be allowed to assume the presidency"" beforehand -- until President Obama's term is finished, there's no vacancy to be filled.  In any case, the Vice President-elect is sworn in before the President-elect, so if for some reason the President-elect could not take the oath of office, the United States would still have an eligible, sitting Vice President available to take over presidential duties when the incumbent's term ended.:Okay, so if the scenario presented here (i.e., Hillary Clinton won the presidential election but was indicted before assuming office) wouldn't necessarily create a ""constitutional crisis,"" what would happen if it played out in real life?Hillary Clinton could simply take office regardless, but it's quite likely that a pending criminal indictment (with the possibility of trial and conviction) would effectively cripple her ability to govern, so she would choose to step down before assuming the presidency.  Exactly what would happen next is unclear because the situation would be an unprecedented one not specifically addressed by the Constitution, but existing law and previous experience provide some guidelines about what to expect.The closest the Constitution comes to addressing this circumstance is the 20th Amendment, which provides that ""If, at the time fixed for the beginning of the term of the President, the President elect shall have died, the Vice President elect shall become President. If a President shall not have been chosen before the time fixed for the beginning of his term, or if the President elect shall have failed to qualify, then the Vice President elect shall act as President until a President shall have qualified.""  Additionally, the 25th Amendment states that ""In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President.""  :Technically none of these provisions would apply, because Hillary Clinton would not have been removed from the presidency by death, nor could she resign an office she had never assumed in the first place.  Clinton could conceivably take the oath of office and then immediately resign, thereby elevating Vice President Tim Kaine to the presidency, but that course of action might be eschewed as one that would create an unseemly political spectacle.It's also possible that Hillary Clinton could simply decline to be sworn in, whereupon Vice President Kaine would become acting President under the 20th Amendment provision that the President elect ""failed to qualify.""  This course is less certain, as the Constitution is unclear on whether a President-elect must take the oath of office to become President or only to execute the powers of that office.  Additionally, it would likely raise constitutional issues of whether Tim Kaine would remain an acting President for the duration of Clinton's ordinary term, whether he would become President in his own right, or whether the former would hold true only until a new President was selected.  Quite possibly the issue would end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, but it's hard to imagine that the outcome would result in anything other than the presumed default of the Vice President's taking over (either as acting President or actual President) for the duration of the term -- especially since prolonged opposition would effectively leave the U.S. leaderless in the meanwhile.  :Whatever may happen, the one scenario that is not a possibility is the one proffered by Farah, that Barack Obama remains in office past 20 January 2017.  Barack Obama's term of office expires on that date without qualification, and having already served two terms as President, he would be ineligible for election to that office again under the terms of the 22nd Amendment."

Bikers in Indonesia film a mysterious humanoid creature,"" and ""Real Hobbit is Accidentally Caught On Camera in Aceh Forest."" :The video, which reportedly shows a naked man spooking a group of dirt bikers before disappearing into a field of tall grass, was originally uploaded to the YouTube page ""Fredography"" on 22 March 2017:Although the video's description provided a general location for the footage -- the Aceh region of Indonesia -- the uploader was not willing to provide further information:Do not ask where, will remain confidential! Watch alone ... ""could be a primitive population, could be the claimant black magic.""So what exactly does this video show? Let's examine some of the most prominent theories behind this footage.:It's fakeWhile conspiracy theorists may claim that the figure spotted in this video is some sort of hobbit or humanoid, other commentators had a simpler explanation: It's fake. This theory holds that the ""creature"" was digitally inserted into the footage, similar to this video of a bear chasing a biker through the woods, or this video of a snowboarder being chased by another bear.  The most convincing piece of evidence for this theory is a still frame from the video::Other commenters claim that the real evidence that the video was faked comes toward the end of the footage, when the figure disappears into the tall grass:Look carefully when the man enters the tall grass. The grass didn't even move one bit and the man just disappears.We slowed down the video to take a closer look at this moment, and did not find that argument convincing. Once the figure ""disappears,"" the stick it is carrying can still be seen as it enters the grass::It's a hobbit/Manti tribe memberOne of the reasons that this video has become so popular is its connection to a piece of Indonesian folklore. Many believe that the figure seen in the video matched the description (tan, with a short stature) of the mythical Mante Tribe. However, experts say that there is little evidence this tribe exists:Anthropologist Fikarwin Zuska of the University of North Sumatra in Medan said no scientific research had proven the existence of the Mante tribe.""The tribe has only been found in Aceh or Gayo folklore,"" Fikarwin said on Friday, adding that books based on folklore made some people consider the story part of history.Aceh historian Rusdi Sufi is also doubtful that the figure seen in the video was a Mante tribe member:No, the video is circulating in Aceh, a bit strange indeed, but something that seemed odd was too exaggerated.:It's a personIt is entirely possible, given how the Internet is, that the figure seen in this video was digitally created as some sort of prank. It is also possible (although highly unlikely) that this footage shows a member of a previously undiscovered ""pygmy tribe"".  However, the most plausible explanation is also the simplest: The video shows a nearly naked human, possibly a child, spooking a group of dirt bike riders before disappearing into a field of tall grass. An unusual scene, and possibly a prankster, but nothing more than that."
634,634,92.ConspiracyTheoristsA,"Two mass shooting ""truthers"" arrested for trespassing and making threats to survivors and family members of those killed by a gunman in a Texas church in 2017 have been released on bond, according to a community member and researcher who tracks the pair. Robert Ussery, 54, and Jodi Mann, 56, were arrested on 5 March 2017 and charged with trespassing at First Baptist Church, the site of a 5 November 2017 mass shooting that claimed 26 lives. Ussery and Mann, who go by the monikers ""Side Thorn"" and ""Conspiracy Granny"" respectively, believe that the shooting was a Homeland Security ""drill"" and the victims never actually existed. Ussery has been charged with trespassing, making terroristic threats, and resisting arrest, while Mann has been charged with trespassing.The Wilson County Sheriff's Office has repeatedly refused to release basic information about the pair's arrest, including pending court dates, bond information, charges and whether or not they are currently in custody. C.W. Wade, a researcher and journalist with HONR Network, an advocacy group that acts on behalf of families and victims of high profile crimes in an effort to shield them from hoaxer harassment, has so far been the only one able to confirm the pair was in custody and ascertain what their charges were through an early-morning phone call to the sheriff's office, which he recorded.:When we called the sheriff's office seeking an update, the woman who answered the phone would say only Ussery was there and now he was not before hanging up on us.Sutherland Springs resident Mike Jordan, who aided shooting victims and has been one of Ussery's harassment targets, told us Ussery and Mann are free on bond on the condition they do not come within half a mile of the church. Jordan was one of the first people on scene (along with his wife and son) who sprang into action to assist the injured, including coming to the aid of a young child who was sitting in a pew when her mother was shot point-blank next to her. Jordan said:We saw this, we lived this, and to have some piece of crap like Robert Ussery come in to our town and tell us we're all actors -- that's what we've been living with and putting up with.For months, the pair has filmed themselves stalking and harassing the Sutherland Springs community, accusing grieving relatives and shooting victims of being liars or actors who were covering up a ""false flag,"" a term that has become conspiracy theorist shorthand for a crisis contrived by the government to seize power. On the day the pair was arrested, they had accosted the church's pastor, Frank Pomeroy, whose 14-year-old daughter was killed in the shooting. Jordan told us Ussery told Pomeroy, ""I will hang you and I will piss on your body while you're hanging."":Both Wade and Jordan said Ussery has a documented history of threatening people, and they both believe he will eventually hurt someone. Wade has compiled a series of screen captures and YouTube videos in which Ussery threatens and verbally abuses people. In one video, Ussery filmed himself sneaking into the 22 January 2017 funeral of a Texas man who was killed while shielding his wife in a botched mall robbery. In the video, Ussery made a point to capture car license plates as well as images of the man's body in a casket. In another video, Ussery appears to be firing a gun, and although it's unclear whether he was actually targeting anyone, he implies that he is.Jordan told us:He's going to end up hurting someone eventually. He's made threats about having guns and I'm like, ""so you're threatening us with firearms now. I'm not sure if you understand, but we're the ones who shot the shooter. I'm not sure it's a good idea to come blazing in to our town threatening to shoot us.""Before his arrest, Ussery posted a video to his web site in which he films himself on the phone with a crying woman whose niece and sister were killed in the Sutherland Springs church shooting. He taunts her, then laughs as she screams and sobs, begging him to leave her alone.:After we contacted YouTube about the video it was removed, but Ussery still has an active YouTube channel showing similar encounters, and both Ussery and Mann have Facebook pages.

Literally people were still inside the building getting shot when that was happening.C.W. Wade said to cope with the problem, YouTube is going to have to crack down on ""grifters"" with large followings who earn their livings spreading hoax conspiracy theories, and laws need to be passed that are in-step with the new reality created by technology. He called InfoWars troll Alex Jones, who has a large YouTube and social media following, the ""gateway drug"" to conspiracy theories:What these [hoaxers] do is not free speech. Free speech is saying, 'Sandy Hook is fake.'

635,635,313.MailbagIsVolkswagens,"10 August 2014Back in April 2014 we reported on the conspiracy rumor that Volkswagen's new ""300 MPG car"" (i.e., the XL1, more accurately described a 235 MPG plug-in diesel-electric hybrid) is ""not allowed in America"" (i.e., cannot legally be sold in the U.S. due to prohibitive federal regulations) because ""it is too efficient"" (i.e., would greatly lessen the demand for gasoline and thereby greatly lessen profits for Big Oil). As we noted in our article on that topic, everything about the rumor was false: The reason Volkswagen's XL1 plug-in diesel-electric hybrid isn't available in the U.S. is because at this point it's still a concept car for which Volkswagen is currently testing the market -- they have produced the XL1 in very small quantities (just a few hundred) for retail sale, all of those vehicles to be sold in Europe via a lottery process for a whopping $160,000 each.  And these supposed restrictive government regulations haven't kept cars that use no gasoline at all, such as the all-electric Tesla Model S and the Nissan Leaf, off the U.S. market.Nonetheless, we still receive mail from readers who are buying into the Big Government/Big Oil collusion conspiracy to keep highly fuel-efficient cars out of the U.S., such as the following::Please update this after reading the Consumer Reports article dealing with hybrids, and how dealers actively discourage people from buying or leasing them.  And next time be more cautious when throwing around the word ""conspiracy"" in a derogatory manner.  After all, when three or more gas stations get together to set the price of gas in an area at thirty cents more than gas costs less than 50 miles away, that IS a conspiracy, and discussing the meeting that took place, even if you get them to admit what was said, is a ""conspiracy theory"".   Comments such as these highlight the importance of actually reading and understanding material rather than simply skimming and accepting anything that sounds like it might confirm what one is already inclined to believe.The Consumer Reports article referenced in the above-quoted comment involved that consumer publication's sending secret shoppers to several dozen automobile dealerships in order to survey how their salespeople dealt with customers expressing interest in plug-in electric vehicles (EVs).   What they found was that salespeople at dealerships sometimes discouraged the sale of plug-in models, steered customers towards gasoline-powered models, and couldn't give accurate or specific answers to basic questions about electric cars.:However, what readers such as the author of the above-quoted comment have failed to grasp is that the cited Consumer Reports article has virtually nothing to do with the facts outlined in our article, other than that they both generally involve the subject of hybrid/electric vehicles.  The Consumer Reports article deals with an occasional reluctance on the part of auto salespeople to push EVs, not a federal regulation prohibiting the U.S. sale of such vehicles; Consumer Reports found such reluctance generally stemmed from salespeople's unfamiliarity with plug-in models rather than a plot to maintain oil company profits; and Consumer Reports also found that ""in the end, most salespeople seemed to have the consumer's interest at heart"" rather than a desire to serve some other master (i.e., Big Oil) to the detriment of car buyers.  Nothing in that article dealt with a conspiracy between government and Big Oil to keep high-mileage vehicles out of the U.S. market, as was (falsely) claimed of the XL1 vehicle we wrote about.And of course the correspondent's chiding coda about a supposed ""conspiracy"" by service station operators to set the retail price of gasoline in their area is irrelevant as it has nothing to do with either regulations barring the sales of high-mileage vehicles nor with a conspiracy to inflate oil company profits.  (In any case, gas station operators, like most all retailers, set their prices at whatever they've determined the market will bear, depending upon factors such as supply, demand, wholesale prices, and competition.):"
636,636,649.BaseCamp,"FACT CHECK: Did a hiker stumble across a ""United Nations Base Camp"" hidden in Missouri?Claim:   A hiker stumbled across a ""United Nations Base Camp"" hidden in Missouri.The ConspiracyExample:   :  Imagine if you will: You're hiking along one of your favorite trails, enjoying nature and time to yourself, and all of a sudden, you come across a military base camp in the middle of nowhere, yet not too far away from roads, etc. in order to make shipments and maneuvers to and from said base camp quite easy and efficient. This was the case for one American citizen who recently contacted the online watchdog group Operation Jade Helm And Beyond with the following message:This was an active nine hole golf course hidden by trees less than 600 feet from the JC (Jefferson City, Missouri) airport and they are building something. Idk what's about to happen but that white tent is surrounded by Mercedes vans that have no licensing and UN stickers on them. I need to get this out because idk how much more is going on but people need to know.Strange military bases have been popping up seemingly overnight in many places across the U.S. in the last couple of months, and many fear they are all related to what is supposed to be nothing more than a military exercise known as Operation Jade Helm 15, which many concerned Americans feel is going to be more than an 'exercise.' Gun grabbing and body snatching are rumored to be in the works for Patriots loyal to the Constitution yet not necessarily loyal to the Obama regime and their seemingly anti-Constitutional agenda.   :Origins:    These images and accompanying text about a hiker who supposedly stumbled across a hidden ""United Nations Base Camp"" near Jefferson City, Missouri, are part of the Jade Helm aspect of conspiracy lore, which holds that the upcoming military exercise of that name slated for July 2015 somehow has to do with the looming imposition of martial law and use of ""FEMA camps"" to incarcerate non-compliant citizens.This particular iteration was published on the Consciously Englightened web site on 12 June 2015 and describes ""an active nine hole golf course hidden by trees less than 600 feet from the JC (Jefferson City, Missouri) airport"" that has been the site of suspicious construction involving a ""white tent surrounded by Mercedes vans that have no licensing and UN stickers on them.""  (Apparently these furtive U.N. minions haven't yet figured out that they shouldn't situate their ""secret"" camps where ordinary folk can walk right up to and photograph them. Or that white tents only work as camouflage when the landscape is covered by snow, which it generally isn't in Missouri in mid-June.)Of course, none of the photographs accompanying the article showed any vans with ""UN stickers"" on them; they all appeared to depict a rather plain tent and ordinary construction equipment::  The Reality:The activity captured in these images is indeed part of a military conspiracy -- one intended to provide recreation for Wounded Warriors. According to Columbia/Jefferson City TV station KMIZ, what's pictured here is the Jefferson City site where the National Guard are assisting in the construction of nine-hole golf course for the disabled on land donated by the owner of the Turkey Creek Golf Center:Danny Baumgarter, owner of Turkey Creek, donated 20 acres to the Missouri Golf Association to build the nine-hole, par 3 course.The National Guard is doing the groundwork for the course as part of a service project. The Guard brought in heavy equipment and constructed tents to live in at the course.The course will be specially outfitted with tee boxes and greens that are wheelchair accessible and can be driven on.:Wounded warrior veterans will play for free.

637,637,10.BillGatesTweetsJokeA,"Claim:Microsoft Co-Founder Bill Gates tweeted the joke, ""I guess we finally ran out of microchips,"" in response to a previous tweet from ""The Daily Show's"" Twitter account.Rating:Correct AttributionAbout this rating Fact CheckIt's true that, on June 15, 2022, Microsoft Co-Founder Bill Gates tweeted, ""I guess we finally ran out of microchips."" Gates' tweet came in response to another tweet from ""The Daily Show's"" Twitter account. ""The Daily Show"" had first tweeted, ""Wow, Bill Gates encourages everyone to get vaccinated, then a year later Internet Explorer dies. Coincidence???"":Both tweets poked fun at debunked conspiracy theories on the subject of COVID-19 vaccines.Gates' reference to microchips can be traced back to near the beginning of the pandemic.In May 2020, The BBC reported on the false and misleading rumor that claimed the entire coronavirus pandemic was ""a cover for a plan to implant trackable microchips and that the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is behind it."" The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told the BBC that the rumor was ""false."":From The BBC:A new YouGov poll of 1,640 people suggests that 28% of Americans believe that Bill Gates wants to use vaccines to implant microchips in people - with the figure rising to 44% among Republicans.Rumors took hold in March when Mr. Gates said in an interview that eventually ""we will have some digital certificates"" which would be used to show who'd recovered, been tested and ultimately who received a vaccine. He made no mention of microchips. That response led to one widely shared article, under the headline: ""Bill Gates will use microchip implants to fight coronavirus.""The article makes reference to a study, funded by The Gates Foundation, into a technology that could store someone's vaccine records in a special ink administered at the same time as an injection. However, the technology is not a microchip and is more like an invisible tattoo. It has not been rolled out yet, would not allow people to be tracked and personal information would not be entered into a database, says Ana Jaklenec, a scientist involved in the study.From what we could tell, ""The Daily Show's"" joke tweet was intended to mirror the kinds of baseless rumors that have been posted by conspiracy theorists during the pandemic. Such conspiracy theorists have been known to draw comparisons between unrelated and sometimes unconfirmed news items, as if such comparisons established some sort of spooky, mysterious, and alarming conclusion. In reality, evidence that comes from credible sources, not unsubstantiated rumors, is the key to building a firm conclusion.:For any readers lost on ""The Daily Show's"" mention of Internet Explorer, it referred to the fact that Microsoft ended support of the web browser on the same day that both tweets were posted. Internet Explorer was first introduced in 1995.In sum, in case Gates' tweet about microchips spreads as a screenshot in the future, yes, he tweeted it, and it was nothing more than a joke."

The removal was first noticed on April 22.A Texas-based Facebook Group with a history of QAnon activity and that was connected to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot was still active on the platform as of late March 2021, despite Snopes repeatedly alerting the social network to the group's actions for over five months. The group was available to join despite the fact that the social media platform claimed to have a policy of removing groups that host QAnon content.The Facebook Group is named Alamo City Trump Train. QAnon activity in the group has included posts where members displayed hashtags and attached conspiratorial signage to trucks. At least one post even sought to educate and recruit members into believing in the debunked conspiracy theory, a seemingly glaring violation of Facebook's policies. Another comment cited the QAnon conspiracy theory: ""Mobile bus of scumbag pedophile trash! Traitors to their own country!"":The group first made headlines in October 2020. We documented posts made in the group that showed it was used as a hub to coordinate real-time movements in an effort to ""block"" and harass a Biden-Harris campaign bus. The FBI was investigating the incident. Facebook hosted real-time, coordinated movements that led to the harassment of the Biden-Harris campaign bus. The group also has a history of hosting violent rhetoric and harassment. In November 2020, members spoke of driving across state lines to travel to areas where presidential votes were being counted. They posted ominous messages about their future intentions. We reported this content to Facebook, but the company failed to respond.:One important day in particular when votes were being counted was Jan. 6, 2021, when members of Congress gathered at the Capitol to certify Electoral College votes. Many of the nation's representatives potentially could have died were it not for the quick thinking of law enforcement officers.Ten days later on Jan. 16, The New York Times reported on a man named Keith Lee. According to the reporting, Lee had originally organized the Alamo City Trump Train Facebook Group's efforts that ended with the harassment of the Biden-Harris bus. Just over two months later, he cased the entrances to the Capitol on the morning of Jan. 6 and then spoke on his live stream to encourage Trump supporters to ""surround"" the building. During the incident, he held a bullhorn and ""called out for the mob to rush in, until his voice echoed from the dome of the Rotunda.""The Times also noted that Lee had helped to fundraise and organize ""dozens of caravans to meet at the Jan. 6 rally.""Despite all of this, the QAnon-filled Alamo City Trump Train Facebook Group was still active nearly three months following the Capitol riot.:Facebook did not respond to our emails."

The Wall Street Journal reported in 2015 that Ukrainians had donated more than citizens of any other country to the Clinton Foundation between 1999 and 2014.What's FalseHowever, we found no evidence that either Hunter or Joe Biden engaged in any wrongdoing in relation to Burisma or Ukraine, or that any of Mitt Romney's sons worked for energy companies linked to Ukraine. John Kerry's stepson never conducted any business in Ukraine, and the association between Ukraine and a Paul Pelosi Jr.-linked energy company is bogus. We also found no evidence exists of any connection between donations to the Clinton Foundation and any of the aforementioned activities. :Amid intensifying debate around the prospect of U.S. President Donald Trump's impeachment after it was revealed he had asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate unsubstantiated rumors about former Vice President Joe Biden's dealings with that country, Republicans and Trump supporters hit back by attempting to tie several high-profile Democrats and their families to Ukraine.Right-leaning websites scrutinized the purported business activities of Paul Pelosi Jr., son of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and attempted to draw a meaningful connection between Ukraine and the Clintons.On Oct. 6, the Twitter account @RealJack posted a widely-shared tweet which claimed that the sons of Biden and Pelosi, as well as those of former Secretary of State John Kerry and Sen.

Biden, Pelosi, Kerry, & Romney all have children working for Ukrainian gas companies. And all of the people I mentioned want Trump impeached.

Are you connecting the dots yet? ?-- Educating Liberals (@Education4Libs) October 8, 2019:These tweets constituted a mixture of some accurate statements with mostly false claims, as well as unsubstantiated suggestions of unspecified wrongdoing or corruption on the part of those involved.Clinton Foundation donationsIn 2015, the Wall Street Journal reported that between 1999 and 2014, Ukrainians had donated more than individuals of any other nationality to the Clinton Foundation, a non-profit humanitarian organization founded by former President Bill Clinton. So @Education4Libs' claim that Ukraine as a country -- rather than individual Ukrainian nationals -- had topped the list of donations was not backed up by the Journal's research.Hillary Clinton stepped away from her seat on the board of directors of the Clinton Foundation when she became Secretary of State in 2009. According to the foundation's website, neither she nor Bill nor Chelsea Clinton has ever derived any personal income from their involvement in the charity.:The BidensHunter Biden, the former vice president's 49-year-old son, served on the board of Burisma Holdings, a major Ukrainian natural gas producer, from 2014 until April 2019, according to multiple reports. His decision to join the company's payroll caused some political discomfort at the time, since Burisma's owner had recently been embroiled in a money-laundering scandal and Biden's father, the vice president, was heading the Obama administration's efforts to discourage and crack down on corruption in Ukraine.However, no evidence has yet emerged suggesting that either Biden engaged in any wrongdoing with regard to Burisma or Ukraine, despite President Trump's efforts to have both men investigated. It is accurate to say that Hunter Biden worked for and was on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company, but no evidence indicates any link between his work there and Ukrainian donations to the Clinton Foundation.Furthermore, @Education4Libs claimed in October that Biden is ""working for"" a Ukrainian gas company, but that's not correct since he stepped down from his place on the board in April 2019.:The PelosisPaul Pelosi Jr., son of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was at one time on the board of a California-based oil-processing company called Viscoil, according to the account he gave in a video recorded in 2010. The link between Viscoil and Ukraine is either tenuous or non-existent and does not appear to involve Pelosi at all.Viscoil was linked to a somewhat shadowy figure going by the name ""Ana Shell,"" who claims to be an investor and environmental entrepreneur, and claims to have provided funding to both Viscoil and another entity called NRG Lab. The purported Ukraine connection arose from a YouTube video posted by ""NRG Lab Research Council"" in 2013, whose caption stated ""Mika Newton helped to secure the rights to build a plant for the production of SH-boxes in Ukraine.""That single line from the caption of an NRG Lab promotional video was cited by Patrick Howley, who writes for The Epoch Times, a website known for promulgating pro-Trump misinformation, in advancing a link between Pelosi and an energy company that ""did business in Ukraine."" However, the claim that Newton, a Ukrainian singer born Oksana Stefanivna Hrytsay, had any connection to NRG Lab or Viscoil, appears to be false.:We found a Facebook page labelled ""Mika_Newton.official"" which appears distinctly unofficial, has very little content apart from ""Ana Shell"" promotional imagery, and includes the following description: ""Hi, my name's Mika Newton. This is my official page to support projects that NRGLab Singapore makes""::Neither Newton's actual official Facebook page nor her Instagram account (where she engages in prolific product promotion) contain any mention of NRG Lab, Viscoil, or ""Ana Shell."" The link between NRG Lab, Newton, and production rights in Ukraine appears to be bogus.In any event, Pelosi appears to have ended his involvement with Viscoil before the bogus Mika Newton connection was ever made. A spokesperson for Speaker Pelosi told PolitiFact that: ""The company [Viscoil] was based in Southern California and focused solely on U.S. business. The company later reorganized under a different name [NRG Lab], but Paul Pelosi Jr. played no role in the new entity.""Pelosi Jr. did travel to Ukraine in 2017, but that trip related to his work for the Corporate Governance Initiative and had no discernible link to Viscoil, NRG Lab, or ""Ana Shell.""John Kerry:This claim is riddled with errors. First off, former Secretary of State and 2004 Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry doesn't have a biological son. The man in question is his stepson, Chris Heinz, who was born to Kerry's wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, and her first husband, John Heinz.Heinz appears to have been added to the list because of his former business partnership with Hunter Biden and their friend Devon Archer. The three men formed an investment firm called Rosemont Seneca, and both Archer and Biden later joined the board of Burisma. However, Heinz did not.In fact, according to reports by The Washington Post and the Washington Examiner, Heinz expressed his own reservations about Archer and Biden's decision at the time, which underlines just how inaccurate and wrongheaded the meme's inclusion of Heinz was.A spokesperson confirmed to Snopes that Heinz had never been involved in Burisma in any way, nor had he ever worked for or sat on the board of directors of any energy company, or even traveled to Ukraine.:Mitt RomneyMitt and Ann Romney have five sons, and we found no evidence that any of them have ever had any involvement with either a ""Ukrainian gas company"" or an ""energy company doing business in Ukraine.""The couple's oldest son Tagg (49) has worked as a vice president at Reebok, chief marketing officer for the Los Angeles Dodgers, founded the investment firm Solamere Capital, and worked as an advisor and surrogate during his father's 2002 Massachussetts gubernatorial campaign as well as his 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns.Matt Romney was previously marketing director for the software company LavaStorm, worked as a real estate developer in California, and as a vice president for the real estate investment firm Excel Trust (which was acquired by the private equity firm Blackstone in 2015).:Josh Romney is president of the Romney Group, a Utah-based real estate and property investment firm, and chairman and owner of Intercap Lending, a mortgage lender. He previously worked as a real estate developer in Salt Lake City.Ben Romney is a radiologist in Utah and Idaho, and Craig Romney, the youngest son, has worked in music production for the advertising firm McGarry Bowen and later for the real estate investment firm Sundance Bay.Contrary to @Education4Libs' claim, Romney had not called for President Trump's impeachment as of Oct. 8, undermining the putative basis for the Romney family's inclusion in the nonexistent conspiracy of wrongdoing to which the meme alluded."
640,640,1.FalseRumorSuggestsSi,"Claim:The sinking of the Titanic was somehow orchestrated by its owner, American financier J.P. Morgan, in order to kill three prominent businessmen who opposed the formation of the Federal Reserve.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On Sept. 13, 2022, a Telegram user shared a baseless meme that hinted the sinking of the Titanic was an inside job. It read, ""These men opposed globalist's world banks (Federal Reserve). Benjamin Guggenheim, Isidor Straus, [and John] Jacob Astor [all] opposed the new Federal Reserve bank. Today, these men would be worth $11 billion. All three of these men were aboard the Titanic when it sank. All three died that night.""::According to the TinEye reverse image search website, this meme had been shared since at least 2014. However, the rumor itself had started spreading several years before.A Baseless Conspiracy TheoryIt's true that American businessman Benjamin Guggenheim, Macy's co-owner Isidor Straus, and fur magnate and real estate developer John Jacob Astor all perished in the sinking of the Titanic. However, the overall claim intimated by the meme was nothing more than a baseless conspiracy theory.The misleading meme appears to have been born out of previous ones that mentioned American financier J.P. Morgan. Morgan owned the companies that managed the Titanic and was not a passenger on its maiden voyage.Past memes suggested that Morgan had somehow miraculously orchestrated the voyage to end in tragedy in order to kill Guggenheim, Straus, and Astor.:J.P. Morgan striking photographer with cane. (Courtesy: Library of Congress)According to the memes, Morgan's supposed reason for planning the demise of the three prominent men was because they all opposed the formation of the Federal Reserve. (The centralized banking system was established in 1913, the year after the sinking of the Titanic.):The meme in question also said, ""Today, these men would be worth $11 billion."" However, it's unclear how much each of the men's descendants would be worth today had they survived.Titanic Expert George Behe Says 'False'In March 2021, Reuters published a thorough report that debunked the rumor behind all of the memes on this subject. The article included an interview with a Titanic expert named George Behe, whose research into the history of Titanic goes all the way back to the 1970s. According to Behe, there is no known evidence that showed Guggenheim, Straus, or Astor opposed the formation of the Federal Reserve. In fact, in 1911, The New York Times reported that Astor was very much in favor of the idea.It's widely agreed upon by experts that the sinking of the Titanic was an accident, the reporting from Reuters said. The ship struck an iceberg on the night of April 14, 1912. Within hours, more than 1,500 people had died.:We contacted Behe in an effort to find out if there had been any updates since Reuters published its story in 2021.""To the best of my knowledge, the conspiracy theory is just as false today as it was when it was first created, and no important new revelations have turned up within the last couple of years,"" Behe told us in an email dated Jan. 8, 2023. ""Sadly, once these nonsensical conspiracy theories have been foisted upon the general public via the internet, the theories are destined to plague humanity forevermore and will continue to fool innocent people who are unfamiliar with the facts.""Thoughts from Historian J. Kent LaytonFor further details, Behe pointed us in the direction of historian J. Kent Layton, who is credited as an author for books including, ""Conspiracies at Sea: Titanic and Lusitania,"" ""On a Sea of Glass: The Life & Loss of the RMS Titanic,"" and ""Recreating Titanic & Her Sisters: A Visual History."":""We've been tackling this nonsense with historical data since at least the late-90s to early-00s,"" Layton told us by email in June 2023. ""However, social media is a fantastic breeding ground for conspiracies of all sorts. Titanic seems to be a favorite of many.""Layton remarked to us in detail regarding why the conspiracy theory made no sense to him:I would point out that if the sinking had actually been a conspiracy to kill those three individuals, there would have been no way that they could ensure their actual demise unless they had locked them somewhere inside the ship to die as it sank. Instead, the evidence indicates that all three were seen during the sinking.Guggenheim famously case aside his heavy coat and lifebelt after his steward had helped him into them, saying that he and his manservant were 'dressed in their best and prepared to go down as gentlemen'.Straus nearly made it into a lifeboat, and fellow passengers even recommended that he board a lifeboat with his wife, but he deferred, preferring to let women and children board while he waited behind with other men.:Astor was seen very late in the disaster, helping his wife into a lifeboat; when he asked an officer loading the boat, apparently Second Officer Lightoller, if he could board, Lightoller said no. However, Lightoller had maintained a rather rigid policy of allowing no men into the lifeboats that he filled, and there had been plenty of other opportunities for Astor to board a boat. In fact, we recently discovered an account that indicated that Astor and his wife had approached an early boat on the other side of the ship, when the situation seemed less serious, but that they had stepped back from the lifeboat of their own accord at the last moment and stayed for a while longer on the ship.If a conspiracy to kill these three men had been so deep and involved so as to actually sink an ocean liner and kill hundreds of innocent people, one would think that the individuals responsible would not have left the survival of these three men to chance.This story will be updated in the future should we uncover any further helpful information.

The implication of such non-detailed posts was the Podesta brothers eerily resembled men wanted in connection with the kidnapping of Madeleine McCann in Portugal on 3 May 2007.:However, the efit sketches depict only one man, who was sought as a witness to the kidnapping (not necessarily as a perpetrator of, or an accessory to, the crime). The digitally generated images were released in October 2013 alongside renewed pleas from police to the public for any information in the McCann cold case:Police have issued two efits that they believe are descriptions of the same man, who is now being sought as a priority by the British detectives leading the new McCann inquiry.He was seen in the vicinity of the Praia da Luz resort in Portugal six years ago at the time that the three-year-old went missing. Despite numerous appeals for information over the years, the man has not come forward to talk to investigators in Portugal or Britain.Descriptions of the suspect were given to the Portuguese inquiry by two witnesses after Madeleine disappeared.It is only now, after Metropolitan police detectives cross-referenced all the information gathered by Portuguese detectives, private investigators and the mobile phone data from the resort, that the significance of the witness statements has been fully understood. In an appeal to be broadcast on Monday night on BBC1's Crimewatch, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood of the Metropolitan police will call for anyone who recognises the man to contact him immediately.:It is true that some reports referenced the man (singular) as a ""suspect,"" but reports also listed a number of other factors that didn't match the Podestas:The inquiry is focusing on 41 suspects and requests for assistance have been issued to 30 countries in a bid to identify and eliminate these people, 15 of whom are British. Crimewatch will feature other efits of individuals that the police would also like to trace ... [The depicted individual] was described by the witnesses as white, aged between 20 and 40, with short brown hair, of medium build, medium height and clean shaven.John Podesta was 67 in December 2016, mearing he was between 58 and 59 at the time of McCann's disappearance, while the man depicted in the efits was described as being between the ages of 20 and 40. Mistaking a man of 40 for one of 58 is already a stretch, and mistaking a 60-year-old man for a 20-year-old one is exceedingly unlike.Some versions of the rumor claimed that John Podesta was in Portugal around the time of the incident, but referenced an e-mail about a trip which occurred several months after Madeleine McCann vanished. In another version, Podesta was placed in Portugal at the time of the disappearance by an unnamed law enforcement source, information that was as implausible as it was unreliable, being backed by no substantive evidence.:An unrelated (yet notable) aspect of the Podesta brothers and their purportedly eerie resemblance to the Madeleine McCann abduction sketches was that before Pizzagate captivated internet investigators, some individuals were invested in separate theories peddling the idea that McCann's parents Gerry and Kate McCann were depicted in both the same sketch and other police drawings:::One version of the rumor provided an account from a witness claiming that Gerry McCann closely resembled the suspect police had been seeking:They gave police witness statements -- they had seen a man carrying a child on that night. Martin Smith senior, described the man as resembling Gerry McCann, carrying a little girl resembling Madeleine McCann, around the time that Kate McCann supposedly discovered her daughter to be missing.Such rumors disregarded the fact that law enforcement agents had access to both the sketches they themselves generated as well as to Gerry McCann.  More than one or two people claimed that Gerry McCann was the man depicted in police sketches, incredibly suggesting that years of law enforcement work on the case had simply failed to reach that obvious conclusion.A British tabloid published an article about the widespread rumors that McCann and the suspect were one and the same, which kicked up after an October 2013 episode of Crimewatch::Scores of people are thought to have made nuisance calls to the inquiry following a fresh appeal for information on the BBC's Crimewatch show.Many boasted on Twitter about their time-wasting stunts, with some claiming they told the police new e-fits released on the programme looked like Madeleine's father Gerry, 44.Twitter user LadyReeve wrote: ""Awks when the e-fit is Gerry McCann! I'm going to ring in and name him just in case the police haven't got it yet #Crimewatch.""Another user called KCAEC said: ""Who's gonna be the 1st person to phone in and say they recognise the e-fit......its Gerry McCann!""Someone called Jont-o'-Lantern Gore also tweeted: ""Chain smoking pack after pack of cigarettes to change my voice so that I can prank call Crimewatch.""Others on Twitter confirmed that police had been sidetracked by a spate of misleading calls ... Trevor Allman, a former London councillor, said: ""Apparently a lot of people have pointed out to the police that the e-fit photo on last night's Crimewatch looks like Gerry McCann."":So far the Crimewatch appeal has generated 2,400 calls and emails to police with information ... Detectives are monitoring the internet for vile messages about the couple after a Facebook group targeting the pair attracted 11,000 members.Claims that the Podesta brothers appeared in the sketches and matched for the ""suspects"" were an example of an extremely common conspiracy theory trope. Virtually identical claims were trotted out weeks after the Sandy Hook mass shooting, when conspiracists claimed that the ""victims"" had appeared in photographs taken with President Obama a few days after the shooting."
642,642,45.ConspiracyJeffreyEps,"On Aug. 10, 2019, convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein died of an apparent suicide while in federal custody as he awaited trial on sex-trafficking charges. These circumstances, as well as his connections to a number of high-profile politicians, such as Presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, raised a number of legitimate questions about his death. Of course, it also sparked plenty of rumors and conspiracy theories. One such conspiracy theory held that the billionaire had faked his death (with the help of authorities) by using a body double. This theory is largely based on a set of photographs allegedly comparing a picture of Epstein when he was alive with a picture of Epstein's corpse. Proponents of this theory claim that some notable differences in Epstein's nose and ear are proof that the corpse photograph actually shows a second person.While this theory has largely been confined to the fringes, it did receive some mainstream attention. The band Foster the People, for instance, shared several messages with their nearly 1 million followers on Twitter.:This theory might hold up a bit more if the ""Epstein Alive"" photograph were recent. However, that image is nearly 15 years old. It's much more plausible that these discrepancies were the result of aging, not evidence of a body double. The ""Epstein Alive"" photograph was taken in September 2004 and shows Epstein having a conversation with lawyer Alan Dershowitz. The full image can be seen on Getty Images. We overlaid the ""Epstein Alive"" image over the original photograph below::The image of ""Epstein Dead"" was taken from a news report filed by the NY Post. The picture was snapped by Post photographer William Farrington and shared by the outlet to the news site's Twitter page.Epstein's facial features may not quite match up in these two photographs. However, a more plausible explanation exists than the theory proposed above.These photographs were taken years apart and likely reflect changes in appearance due to aging. This is especially true for the areas around the nose and ears, which are made out of cartilage, not bone, and continue to change as we age:According to the FARC (Functional Anatomy Research Center) researchers' analyses, all measurements were significantly affected by age. Nasal volume, area, and liner distance increased. In other words, they found that noses get bigger over time.Another consistent finding is that the nasal tip angle--the angle created along the bridge of the nose, around the tip to the vertical space above the upper lip--decreases, meaning the nose tends to droop with age. (Source: Verywell Health)Several reasons have been adduced for the growth. Ears (and indeed noses) sag with age, thanks both to a loss of elasticity in the skin and to the effects of gravity. Earlobes droop, a phenomenon that can be accentuated by heavy earrings. More controversially, it has been suggested that because, unlike bone, cartilage continues to grow and ears are made of cartilage, that may also account for the phenomenon. But the evidence is sketchy, and some researchers argue that cartilage is only being replaced and does not account for the growth in ear size. (Source: The Guardian):The discrepancies in these photographs likely can be explained by the normal effects of aging, as opposed to a body double, a faked death, and a government cover-up. Epstein was found dead in his cell on the morning of Aug. 10.

The New York City medical examiner performed on autopsy on Epstein the following day (as reported by The New York Times):The city's chief medical examiner, Dr. Barbara Sampson, announced on Sunday night that her office had conducted an autopsy of Mr. Epstein, but she declined to release a determination about the cause of death.She said a private pathologist, Dr. Michael Baden, who was hired by Mr. Epstein's lawyers, had observed the autopsy examination.The medical examiner is confident the cause of death is suicide by hanging, but she wants more information from law enforcement before releasing her determination, a city official said.:"
643,643,151.DidBuffaloShootingSu,"On May 14, 2022, an allegedly racially motivated mass shooting left 10 people dead at a shopping market in Buffalo, New York. In the aftermath, many pointed out that a lengthy piece of text supposedly written by the suspect had discussed the ""Great Replacement Theory,"" a white supremacist narrative that has gained traction among some GOP officials and Fox News hosts. In an apparent attempt to deflect criticism of Fox News, Donald Trump Jr., among others, claimed that the killer had also explicitly attacked Fox News in his screed. :Did the suspect attack Fox News in the screed? Have Tucker Carlson and Fox News discussed the Great Replacement Theory? Here's what we were able to find out. The Great Replacement TheoryThe Great Replacement Theory is a racist ideology that argues white people are losing their rightful place of power in the world as they are replaced by minorities. White supremacists often argue that the white race is under threat of extinction and that minorities are planning a white genocide. NPR wrote:In short, the ""Great Replacement"" is a conspiracy theory that states that non-white individuals are being brought into the United States and other Western countries to ""replace"" white voters to achieve a political agenda. It is often touted by anti-immigration groups, white supremacists and others, according to the National Immigration Forum.White supremacists argue that the influx of immigrants, people of color more specifically, will lead to the extinction of the white race.:Did Buffalo Shooting Suspect Subscribe to the Great Replacement Theory?Two days before the shooting, 18-year-old Payton Gendron reportedly shared a rambling 180-page PDF in Google Docs that laid out an argument for a racist attack. Throughout the document, Gendron, who had the N-word scrawled across his rifle, repeatedly cites the ""great replacement"" conspiracy theory as the driving ideology. NBC News reported:The manifesto includes dozens of pages of antisemitic and racist memes, repeatedly citing the racist ""great replacement"" conspiracy theory frequently pushed by white supremacists, which falsely claims white people are being ""replaced"" in America as part of an elaborate Jewish conspiracy theory. Other memes use tropes and discredited data to denigrate the intelligence of nonwhite people ... The document also claims ""critical race theory,"" a recent right-wing talking point that has come to generally encompass teaching about race in school, is part of a Jewish plot, and a reason to justify mass killings of Jews.:Buffalo News added:At the heart of the document is Gendron's belief in the racist theory that whites are in danger of being replaced by non-whites, who must be removed from this country or slaughtered. Blacks and Jews draw most of Gendron's vitriol in the manifesto.""We are seeing an entire generation of young people being radicalized by the internet,"" said Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Centre for Analysis of the Radical Right and a former longtime leader at the Southern Poverty Law Center.Have Fox News, GOP Officials Pushed the Great Replacement Theory?While the replacement theory was once confined to white supremacist circles, it has recently entered the mainstream as it has repeatedly been discussed by Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Some GOP officials, such as Matt Gaetz and Elise Stefanik, have also pushed this ideology. :The New York Times reported:No public figure has promoted replacement theory more loudly or relentlessly than the Fox host Tucker Carlson, who has made elite-led demographic change a central theme of his show since joining Fox's prime-time lineup in 2016. A Times investigation published this month showed that in more than 400 episodes of his show, Mr. Carlson has amplified the notion that Democratic politicians and other assorted elites want to force demographic change through immigration, and his producers sometimes scoured his show's raw material from the same dark corners of the internet that the Buffalo suspect did.Did Buffalo Shooter Attack Fox News?As reporters noted the connections between the suspected shooter's screed and the replacement talking points heard on Fox News, some came to the network's defense and claimed that the suspect had explicitly attacked Fox News in his manifesto. :This claim was based on an image graphic featuring headshots of various Fox News personalities (Carlson was not included), each of which was stamped with a Jewish star. The graphic was posted next to similar pieces of media that featured the employees of CNN, The New York Times, NBC News, CBS News, and NPR.But the suspect did not attack Fox News for its editorial coverage. Rather, the attack was related to the anti-Semitic notion that Jewish people run all news media. Not only is this false, but it is rooted in long-running, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories holding that Jewish people control the banks, the media, and the world in general. The ADL writes:Jews account for approximately 0.2 percent of the global population. And yet antisemites believe that this tiny minority is not only on a quest for total world domination, but is already in control of banks, the media, industry, government -- even the weather.This is the only time Fox News is mentioned in the screed. :Was the Shooter Radicalized by Fox News?While the suspect subscribed to the replacement theory, and while this theory has been promoted by Fox News, there's no evidence that the suspect frequently watched Carlson's program (or other Fox News shows).The Washington Post reported that the suspect appeared to have been radicalized online, not via cable news. Before the shooting rampage that also left three wounded, the suspect, Payton S. Gendron, 18, allegedly posted a lengthy document invoking the idea that White Americans were at risk of being ""replaced"" by people of color because of immigration and higher birthrates.Gendron, who is White, allegedly indicated that he chose a neighborhood with a large number of Black residents for his alleged attack. In the document that Gendron is suspected to have written, he indicated that he was radicalized online. There's no indication that he watched Carlson's program.The theory was once confined to far-right White extremists, who cast immigration as part of a plot by ""elites"" to take political and economic power away from White people. It has gained broader circulation in recent years as a talking point among prominent conservative media figures.:"
644,644,218.IsCometPingPongPizze,"Claim:The 'Podesta e-mails' revealed the existence of a secret society of pedophiles operating through a pizza place loosely connected to Clinton associate David Brock.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 4 November 2016, Reddit user u/DumbScribblyUnctious published a thread titled ""Comet Ping Pong - Pizzagate Summary"" to subreddit r/The_Donald (a community of Donald Trump supporters), which appears to have touched off a complex and detailed conspiracy theory involving WikiLeaks' release of e-mails from former Hillary Clinton presidential campaign chair John Podesta, child exploitation, and a Washington, D.C., pizzeria called Comet Ping Pong.:None of this elaborate conspiracy theory was true, as the New York Times noted:None of it was true. While [Comet Ping Pong pizzeria owner James] Alefantis has some prominent Democratic friends in Washington and was a supporter of Mrs. Clinton, he has never met her, does not sell or abuse children, and is not being investigated by law enforcement for any of these claims. He and his 40 employees had unwittingly become real people caught in the middle of a storm of fake news.""From this insane, fabricated conspiracy theory, we've come under constant assault,"" said Mr. Alefantis, 42, who was once in a relationship with David Brock, a provocative former right-wing journalist who became an outspoken advocate for Mrs. Clinton.Although the original ""Pizzagate"" post was deleted at some point between 4 and 21 November 2016, archived versions of it contained what appeared to be the original post in its entirety. (A subreddit dedicated to the controversy, r/pizzagate, was created in the interim.) A brief and incomplete summary of the theory espoused in the original post goes as follows::Comet Pizza is a pizza place owned by James Alefantis, who is the former gay boyfriend of David Brock, the CEO of Correct The Record. It has been the venue for dozens of events for the Hillary campaign staff. John Podesta has had campaign fundraisers there for both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. John's brother and business partner Tony Podesta has his birthday party there every year. [https://i.sli.mg/1MqPHA.png]It's also a dive that according to reviews and photos has hidden bathroom doors and creepy murals. The bathrooms in particular have murals exclusively of nude women, as well as a great deal of graffiti relating to sex. Reviews of the restaurant are bizarrely polarized. Websites describing it positively note that there are regularly ""unsupervised children running around"". Their menu include a pedophilic symbol, as do the signs and decorations of other neighboring businesses.The music acts and the posters promoting same acts are bizarre in their presentation, content, and lyrical focus, but are still promoted as being ""for all ages"". The overtly sexual content would suggest otherwise.The same has taken place in reference to videos recorded inside Comet Ping Pong by people that frequent their establishment as well as video referencing Comet Ping Pong positively from the exterior.:While initially not the central focus of the investigation at the onset, Comet Ping Pong is a much more overt and much more disturbing hub of coincidences. Everyone associated with the business is making semi-overt, semi-tongue-in-cheek, and semi-sarcastic inferences towards sex with minors. The artists that work for and with the business also generate nothing but cultish imagery of disembodiment, blood, beheadings, sex, and of course pizza.Several pages were linked to support the details of the claim (an e-mail in which David Brock was described as ""batshit crazy"" by Clinton associate Neera Tanden was among them) and the post primarily focused on Alefantis and his loose ties to the Clinton campaign via a former romantic relationship with David Brock of Media Matters for America.Users tracked down Alefantis' purported Instagram account (since deleted or restricted), which they said hosted images of children, gay clubs, drugs, and generally ""bizarre"" or unsettling imagery:James Alefantis' instagram late 11/5/16. by morning of 11/7/16 it was set to private.We recently found the instagram account of James Alefantis. The contents of it are indescribably bizarre and the contexts of the posts and comment chains are weird. Alefantis does not have any children nor do his closest associates, but the photos seem to be a near constant assortment of different children of a variety of ages, intermingled between posts about gay bars, clubs, photos of common rape drugs, and piles of foreign currency. After it being trawled through for 24 hours it has been set to private. A large set of archived copies can be seen here in the next section. Similarly the instagram and twitter accounts of Comet Ping Pong are being edited selectively. The accounts of the people favoriting and commenting on these posts are equally bizarre in both content, context, and demeanor.:However, the photographs that the Instagram account purportedly hosted were instead, apparently, taken from the pages of various people who ""liked"" the restaurant's page on Facebook: In a statement, the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department said it was monitoring the situation and is ""aware of general threats being made against this establishment."" The F.B.I. said it ""does not confirm or deny the existence of investigations.""Most troubling for Mr. Alefantis and staff has been the use of children's images, pilfered from the restaurant's social media pages and the personal accounts of friends who had ""liked"" Comet Ping Pong online. Those photos have been used across dozens of websites. Parents, who declined to talk publicly for fear of retribution, have hired lawyers to get the photos removed.Some of the photographs were apparently taken from random web sites:@HagmannPI Why did you lie? You showed a supposedly authentic picture, but it's from a website. So was everything a lie?? pic.twitter.com/YwqoXWYGKr-- Marla Craig (@marla_mulder) November 5, 2016:Alefantis also said many of the photographs were of children of family and friends, not patrons of Comet Ping Pong:""The most sickening part of this vicious attack has been the stealing of Instagram images, Facebook images of children, minors, aged 5, 7, and 8 years old that are then slapped across their chat boards as nothing but pawns,"" Alefantis says. ""Yes, it's scary to be attacked, it's dangerous for business, but it's disgusting and filthy of these people to be posting photos on these websites. ... Someone should be prosecuting these people.""Alefantis says the photos have been lifted from his personal social media accounts, and those of his friends and employees--not from the restaurant. ""Kids in the restaurant are completely safe, none of these people are going there, they're cowards,"" he says, emphasizing that this scandal only exists on the internet. Inside the restaurant it's business as usual ... While Alefantis says he can weather the storm, he's concerned about others who may not have as much community backing as he does. ""I personally worry for the individuals who are being attacked and smeared and slandered and maligned and for other independent businesses or restaurants who are less established than Comet."":Scattered evidence from previously leaked Podesta communications was included, such as an e-mail about children orphaned after 2010's catastrophic earthquake in Haiti (along with information about adoption agencies and trafficking), or another thread claiming Clinton campaign manager John Podesta and his brother Tony Podesta were purportedly in Portugal at the time Madeleine McCann disappeared.Additional evidence was presented in collage format, visually ""linking"" unrelated Instagram screengrabs, a number of individuals supposedly involved, purported coded signaling for pedophiles (such as a butterfly or a ""play, eat, drink"" insignia which could be abbreviated ""PED""), and assertions that underground tunnels linked adjacent business (which themselves also use pedophilia code in their materials):::Imagery widely believed to be code for pedophiles to signal one another was a common theme in the myriad Pizzagate theories.  Purported symbols such as butterflies and spirals were increasingly spotted in unrelated places, creating the impression that conspiracy was as vast as it was nebulous.(As we have noted in the past, fear of ""pedophile code"" imagery is occasionally the basis for panic, but law enforcement officials believed that the symbols themselves are used among adults to signal preferences, not as labels for children, not as markers placing them in any danger.)On 6 November 2016, Washington City Paper summarized the claims, noting that the rumors originated with long-circulating claims about Bill Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein, and confirming Alefantis' link to Brock:Trump supporters on sites like Reddit and 4chan have long been looking for a stronger connection between Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein, a financial tycoon and sex offender whose plane Bill Clinton sometimes used. The Wikileaks release of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta's hacked emails inspired a feverish, and mostly hapless, search for salacious scandal evidence, while PolitiFact calls the evidence for a Clinton sex network ""ridiculously thin.""Late this week, Trump supporters on 4chan and Reddit began to focus on ""Pizzagate""-- innocuous connections between Podesta and emails mentioning pizza that they claimed were far more sinister than they initially appeared.Why, they wondered, did Podesta have a handkerchief with a ""pizza-related"" map on it? And why did Podesta get so many emails about eating pizza?The answer to any reasonable person would be that Podesta eats pizza sometimes. Indeed, Alefantis says, ""pizza's always a big thing in politics."" ... To the alt right, though, ""pizza"" became a suspected code word for illegal sex trafficking. ... In one 2008 email released by Wikileaks, Alefantis thanked Podesta for attending a fundraiser at the restaurant but regretted not making him a pizza. That drew amateur theorists' attention to the restaurant's murals, which they declared ""creepy,"" and the sliding doors in front of the restaurant's bathrooms, dubbed ""hidden rooms."":In the period between 6 November 2016 and 21 November 2016, social media users continued to examine purported links to the pizzeria. Not long after Comet Ping Pong became the center of myriad ambiguous child abuse theories, the business' Yelp page was locked down by the site's operators, along with the following note:This business recently made waves in the news, which often means that people come to this page to post their views on the news ... While we don't take a stand one way or the other when it comes to these news events, we do work to remove both positive and negative posts that appear to be motivated more by the news coverage itself than the reviewer's personal consumer experience with the business.:By 15 November 2016, Alefantis told Washington City Paper the rumors showed no sign of abating, and had begun to affect adjacent venues (who were, according to the conspiracy theory, connected to the pizza restaurant by underground tunnels, apparently including a non-governmental organization across the street that works with Haitian orphans).The Pizzagate/Comet Ping Pong social media investigation bore striking similarity to a similar Reddit-based panic concerning a ""creepy day care"" in January 2015. The Fun Time Kidz Day Care conspiracy quickly spiraled into offline harassment and in-person surveillance, but nothing came of the deeply scrutinized claims.On 1 December 2016, Comet Ping Pong announced the addition of stronger security measures due to then-ongoing harassment, some of which affected nearby businesses:Articles [about Pizzagate have] proliferated on websites that publish intentionally fake news stories ... The conspiracy-peddling spilled over into the real world as Comet Ping Pong, Alefantis, and his restaurant's employees started receiving threatening phone calls, text messages, and social-media messages. Neighboring businesses like Little Red Fox and Politics & Prose have reported receiving some spillover abuse as the ""Pizzagate"" rumors continue to fester.:Via Facebook update, the venue stated:Comet Ping Pong, like any respectable venue, is dedicated to creating a safe and inviting space for all of our concert-goers. There have been no hostile situations at the venue, and we do not anticipate any altercations as much of the harassment has occurred online, but as we have before we now have security present at every show. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact the Comet Ping Pong Live Music page or any of the show staff.On 4 December 2016, police detained an unidentified man who entered Comet Ping Pong carrying an assault rifle and allegedly fired one shot:A North Carolina man was arrested Sunday after he walked into a popular pizza restaurant in Northwest D.C. carrying an assault rifle and fired one or more shots, D.C. Police said, prompting patrons and employees to flee.The incident caused panic, with several businesses going into lockdown as police swarmed the neighborhood after receiving the call shortly before 3 p.m.Police Chief Peter Newsham said the lone suspect in his late-20s walked in the front door of Comet Ping Pong and appears to have fired one or multiple shots into the ground after employees and patrons had fled. The suspect, who police say is from Salisbury, N.C., has not been identified and his motives were not clear. Police said charges were pending ... Vivek Jain, of Potomac, Md. was eating lunch inside Banana Leaf, a nearby Indian restaurant, when Comet patrons came rushing inside. He said Banana Leaf was locked down for about 90 minutes.""A bunch of people ran in from Comet and said a man walked in with a gun,"" Jain said.:Although the Pizzagate controversy remains a high-interest conspiracy, we are unable to locate any substantive aspect of the claims that could be fact-checked or otherwise held up to the light to determine their veracity. And while rumors about pedophilia and child trafficking remain standard in urban folklore, roughly 90 percent [PDF] of assaults on children in the U.S. are committed by a friend or family member, a number reiterated by the United States Department of Justice. Most [PDF] abuse of the nature alleged is committed by family members, family friends, or other trusted adults -- without the use of coded toys or pizzeria sex rings. "
645,645,4.DidtheCIAInventtheTe,"This article by Michael Butter is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.Conspiracy theories have a long history, but the actual term ""conspiracy theory"" emerged much more recently. It was only a few decades ago that the term took on the derogatory connotations it has today, where to call someone a conspiracy theorist functions as an insult. So it may come as no surprise that there is even a conspiracy theory about the origins of the label. This conspiracy theory claims that the CIA invented the term in 1967 to disqualify those who questioned the official version of John F Kennedy's assassination and doubted that his killer, Lee Harvey Oswald, had acted alone.There are even two versions of this conspiracy theory. The more extreme version claims that the CIA literally invented the term in the sense that the words ""conspiracy"" and ""theory"" had never been used before in combination. A more moderate version acknowledges that the term existed before, but claims that the CIA intentionally created its negative connotations and so turned the label into a tool of political propaganda.:The more moderate version has been particularly popular in recent years for two reasons. First, it is very easy to disprove the more extreme claim that the CIA actually invented the term. As a search on Google Books quickly reveals, the term ""conspiracy theory"" emerged around 1870 and began to be more frequently used during the 1950s. Even die-hard conspiracy theorists have a hard time trying to ignore this. Second, the more moderate version received a big boost in popularity a few years ago when American political scientist Lance DeHaven-Smith propagated it in a book published by a renowned university press.Smoking gunAlthough they make differing claims about the origin and development of the term, the proponents of both versions invariably point to an official CIA document called Concerning Criticism of the Warren Report as their smoking gun. It was released in 1976 after The New York Times requested it under the Freedom of Information Act. :The document expresses concern about the considerable number of people who doubted the official investigation into Kennedy's murder, the Warren Commission, which found that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. It also aims to equip CIA contacts with arguments against those who challenge the findings and the official version of the event. For example, it emphasises that nobody in their right mind would have chosen someone as unstable as Oswald as a pawn in a larger plot. And it points out the logical fallacies of these alternative accounts.:The CIA document.History Matters ArchiveOne may find the CIA's attempt to influence public opinion problematic. But there is not a single sentence in the document that indicates the CIA intended to weaponise, let alone introduce the term ""conspiracy theory"" to disqualify criticism. In fact, ""conspiracy theory"" in the singular is never used in the document. ""Conspiracy theories"" in the plural is only used once, matter-of-factly in the third paragraph:Conspiracy theories have frequently thrown suspicion on our organisation, for example, by falsely alleging that Lee Harvey Oswald worked for us. The authors of the document deploy the term in a very casual manner and obviously do not feel the need to define it. This indicates that it was not a new term but already widely used at the time to describe alternative accounts. At no time do the authors recommend using the label ""conspiracy theory"" to stigmatise alternative explanations of Kennedy's assassination. This suggests that the term had not yet acquired the same level of negativity it possesses today.:Why people believe itThe far more interesting issue, for me, is why this conspiracy theory emerged and why so many people believe in it. No scholar has yet fully charted the course of this particular theory, so it's hard to pinpoint exactly when it emerged. But it is safe to assume that it was during the 1980s or 1990s based on cursory investigations. It was only in the 1980s that the term ""conspiracy theory"" began to really have the negative connotations we associate with it today. So the conspiracy theory about the term's origins was likely a reaction to this growing negativity.The reason why so many people believe in the idea that the CIA invented the term ""conspiracy theory"" relates to the role of the Kennedy assassination in the larger history of the concept and their popularity. It may seem that we are living in an age of conspiracy theory, but such theories were even more popular in the past. :Conspiracy theories swirled around Kennedy's assassination.rblfmr / shutterstock.comFrom at least the 17th century to the 1950s, conspiracy theories were a widely accepted way of understanding the world and often the official versions of events. They were articulated by elites and usually targeted external enemies or subversives who were allegedly trying to undermine the state. It was only during the late 1950s and early 1960s that conspiracy theories started to become a stigmatised way of explaining big events.One side-effect of this move from the mainstream to the margins of society was that conspiracy theories started to primarily target societal and political elites. They are no longer concerned with alleged plots against the state but with those orchestrated by the state.Another side-effect of this new stigma was that the label conspiracy theory or theorist became a pejorative term. The Kennedy assassination was the first major instance in which conspiracy theorists accused the state of secretly plotting evil and provided alternative accounts that were then labelled conspiracy theories, as in the 1967 CIA document. So it is hardly surprising that conspiracy theorists - who blame events on the intentional actions of evil people - retrospectively see the emergence of the term as a deliberate attempt to uphold the official version of the Kennedy assassination.:Michael Butter, Professor of American Literary and Cultural History, University of TubingenThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

647,647,230.WhatWeKnowSoFarAbout,"On 22 July 2016, Wikileaks published a gigantic dump of 20,000 e-mails sent inside the Democratic National Committee (DNC) between January and May of 2016 and hashtagged #DNCLeaks; the release was said to be the first in a series and came three days ahead of the Democratic National Convention.What are #DNCLeaks, and why were they so controversial?Initial information on the scope and basic information can be found in an earlier article on this web site, and summarized in an infographic tweeted by WikiLeaks on 25 July 2016::Issues of dispute regarding the content of the leaks were legion. Unquestionably, the e-mails demonstrated that the DNC operated as an arm of the Hillary Clinton campaign, planting information in the media to flatter Clinton and damage opponent Bernie Sanders. The revelations were particularly damaging because the DNC was obligated to behave neutrally, and had repeatedly denied the demonstrated favor toward Clinton existed. Following a contentious and later debunked claim Sanders supporters ""incited violence and chaos"" at a Nevada caucus (and threw chairs), former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz both reiterated the now-debunked ""chair"" claim and at the thirty-second mark stated that campaign neutrality was part of the DNC's charter::As the former chairperson alluded during that May 2016 appearance on CNN, the DNC's Charter & Bylaws (current as of 28 August 2015) held [PDF]: The National Chairperson shall serve full time and shall receive such compensation as may be determined by agreement between the Chairperson and the Democratic National Committee. In the conduct and management of the affairs and procedures of the Democratic National Committee, particularly as they apply to the preparation and conduct of the Presidential nomination process, the Chairperson shall exercise impartiality and evenhandedness as between the Presidential candidates and campaigns. The Chairperson shall be responsible for ensuring that the national officers and staff of the Democratic National Committee maintain impartiality and evenhandedness during the Democratic Party Presidential nominating process.The later-substantiated claim was foreshadowed during a December 2015 data breach controversy during which the Sanders campaign was accused by the DNC of accessing Clinton campaign data and swiftly blocked access to a vital campaign tool. The Sanders campaign immediately filed suit [PDF] against the DNC to restore access, maintaining in a complaint that an agreement between candidates and the Committee was violated (as it allowed for 10 days to remedy a breach) and that the Clinton campaign was not sanctioned for identical actions in 2008.  In another controversial communication, a DNC staffer included ""a script for a new video we'd like to use to mop up some more taco bowl engagement, and demonstrate the Trump actually isn't trying."" The language employed was seen by critics as offensive and a cynical view of the Latino vote.  :What happened after WikiLeaks released the e-mails?The release immediately made massive waves first on social media (where users widely accused Facebook and Twitter of censoring the leaks), before largely reaching the national media on 24 July 2016::  On 23 July 2016, Twitter denied accusations of censorship in response to tweets from WikiLeaks: Immediately, social media users seized upon what were perceived as particularly worrisome e-mails among the 20,000 released. Among them were communications heavily suggesting favor to the Clinton campaign, evidence of story-planting in concert with media outlets such as the Wall Street Journal and Politico, an April 2016 drafted announcement proclaiming Sanders' ostensible exit from the race, and a suggestion from DNC CFO Brad Marshall that a member of the press be tapped to smear Bernie Sanders on his religious beliefs.  Media watchdog Fair.org summarized the #DNCLeaks aftermath in a compendium piece, surmising::While it's impossible to know whether systemic pro-Hillary Clinton bias at the DNC was decisive in the 2016 Democratic primary race, we now know beyond any doubt that such a bias not only existed, but was endemic and widespread. DNC officials worked to plant pro-Clinton stories, floated the idea of using Sanders' secular Judaism against him in the South, and  routinely ran PR spin for Clinton, even as the DNC claimed over and over it was neutral in the primary. The evidence in the leaks was so clear that Debbie Wasserman Schultz has resigned her role as DNC chair--after her speaking role at the Democratic National Convention this week was scrapped--while DNC co-chair Donna Brazile, who is replacing Wasserman Schultz in the top role, has apologized to the Sanders camp. Pro-Clinton pundits were quick to dismiss what was literally a conspiracy to railroad the Sanders campaign as nothing more than a yawn[.] ... what was once dismissed out of hand--that the DNC was actively working against the Sanders campaign--is now obviously true, but not a big deal. This is a textbook PR spin pattern seen time and time again, what might be called the Snowden Cycle: X is a flaky conspiracy theory - X is revealed to be true - X is totally obvious and not newsworthy.On 24 July 2016, Debbie Wasserman Schultz was ousted on the eve of the convention and was invited to a purely symbolic role with the Clinton campaign.   :Have the leaks been authenticated?On 24 July 2016, Politico acknowledged collusion between staffer Ken Vogel and the campaign on a piece prior to its submission to editors. The same outlet reported that Marshall apologized for his pitching of a religious smear. Alongside Wasserman Schultz's ouster and an apology to the Sanders campaign by Donna Brazile, the discrete developments were widely viewed as indirect confirmation the leaked e-mails were authentic:Party Chair role will now pass to neutral DNC mbr Donna ""I will cuss out the Sanders camp!"" Brazile. @VanJones68 pic.twitter.com/CTv4fOuENq -- Norris Agnew (@Norris_Agnew) July 24, 2016Who is responsible for the leaks?

Fair.org noted that the theory lay largely unproved since first floated by a DNC contractor in June 2016: :Talking Points Memo editor Josh Marshall (7/23/16) released a rather paranoid rundown the day of the leaks on how Putin was conspiring with Trump (a fairly good debunking of which can be found here), soon after dismissing the substance of the leaks as Russian propaganda white noise. Manysoonfollowedsuit: The DNC leaks as Russian spy operation was the preferred talking point of the day, omitting or glossing over what the leaks actually entailed. The actual culpability of Russia for those leaks, it's worth noting, is still unproven. The only three parties that have audited the hack are contractors for the US government, and the DNC's initial story has since changed considerably. At first the DNC (and by extension their security firm CrowdStrike) said ""no financial, donor or personal information appears to have been accessed or taken,"" but this later turned out not to be true at all. Six weeks since the hack was first revealed by the Washington Post(6/14/16), no one in the US government, including the FBI and White House (who have reportedly reviewed the situation in detail), have implicated or even suggested Russian involvement in the leak-neither on the record nor anonymously. Thus far, all suggestions to this effect have taken place outside the organs of the United States government -- a common and deliberate conflation that even led to this correction in the Vox recap of the situation (7/23/16): Correction: I misread the Washington Post's story on last month's DNC hack and misattributed the Russia link to the US government rather than independent security researchers.:The cited Talking Points Memo piece by Marshall didn't mention the leaks by name nor outwardly connect them to Russia, it simply made a vague case for Donald Trump maintaining a ""bromance"" with Vladimir Putin vis a vis advisor Paul Manafort. On 24 July 2016, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said ""voters need to reflect"" on the possibility floated by unnamed ""experts"" (mentioned multiple times but not specified) that Russian operatives were affirmatively working to elect Trump via the release: Although Mook claimed the timing was suspect, WikiLeaks held:#DNCLeak: WikiLeaks chose the publishing date. As usual, we published as soon as the docs were verified & as fast as resources permitted.-- WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) July 24, 2016:Shortly after the Russia conspiracy theory was injected into the news cycle by the DNC and its contractor Crowdstrike Bloomberg reported DNC officials believed drawing such a connection might outweigh voter concern over the content of then-forthcoming leaks: The hackers' link to the Russian government was first identified by CrowdStrike Inc., working for the Democratic Party. A law firm reviewing the DNC's initial findings, Baker & McKenzie, has begun working with three additional security firms -- FireEye Inc., Palo Alto Networks Inc. and Fidelis Cybersecurity -- to confirm the link, according to two people familiar with the matter, underscoring Democrats' concerns that the stolen information could be used to try to influence the outcome of the November election. If the Democrats can show the hidden hand of Russian intelligence agencies, they believe that voter outrage will probably outweigh any embarrassing revelations, a person familiar with the party's thinking said.Almost exactly a month later, Vox reported on 23 July 2016 that evidence from the interim period to support the widespread conspiracy theory was questionable: :Still, it's worth being clear that there's zero evidence that Trump or Manafort has direct ties to the Russian government. On the other hand, there is significant circumstantial evidence that the attacks on the DNC were closely linked to Russian intelligence agencies. Multiple security researchers have looked at forensic evidence from the attacks and concluded that the attackers used the same kind of techniques that Russian intelligence agencies have used against other targets around the world.Investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald, known primarily in part for his collaboration with former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden to leak damaging information about surveillance, reiterated that the claim appeared to come solely from Democratic officials (i.e., individuals interested in discrediting the source of the leaks to bury their content): @binarybits Just one point: it wasn't really the WashPost that said it was Russia, but just unnamed Dem officials & experts who claimed it. -- Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) July 23, 2016WikiLeaks also weighed in on the claims, repeatedly maintaining anyone claiming to know the source of the leaks was lying::Note on sourcing #DNCLeaks. We have, as usual, not revealed our sources. Anyone who claims to know who our source is has no credibility.-- WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) July 22, 2016Clinton campaign pushing lame conspiracy smear that we are Russian agents.

We have not revealed our sources & no one disputes veracity.-- WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) July 24, 2016Wikileaks also suggested the leak might have come from inside the DNC. Similarly, in a July 2016 interview with Democracy Now! Assange insinuated that the leaks were internal in nature. Moreover, Assange stated that the DNC's ""Russian spies"" claim did not itself agree with the dates it provided for breaches. Assange referenced the above-embedded interview [audio] between Robby Mook and Jake Tapper; Assange stated that the clip was cut off early, and Mook was unable to name the ""experts"" referenced: :AMY GOODMAN: So, that was Robby Mook citing experts saying the DNC emails were leaked by the Russians. You were the one who released these 20,000 emails, Julian Assange. Where did you get them? JULIAN ASSANGE: Well, what's not in that clip there by Robby is that, just afterwards, he was asked by Jake Tapper, ""Who are these experts? Can you name them?"" The answer was no, a refusal to name the experts. But we have seen one of the experts, so-called experts, that the Democratic Party is trying to base its incredible conspiracy theory on about WikiLeaks. And that is this--what we jokingly refer to as the NSA dick pic guy. He's a former National Security Agency agent who started to produce conspiracy theories about us in 2013, when we were involved in the Edward Snowden rescue, as a means to try and undermine the Snowden publications, subsequently embroiled in some amateur pornography scandal. That's why they don't want to name their experts, because they are people like this. In relation to sourcing, I can say some things. A, we never reveal our sources, obviously. That's what we pride ourselves on. And we won't in this case, either. But no one knows who our source is. It's simply speculation. It's, I think, interesting and acceptable to speculate who our sources are. But if we're talking about the DNC, there's lots of consultants that have access, lots of programmers. And the DNC has been hacked dozens and dozens of times. Even according to its own reports, it had been hacked extensively over the last few years. And the dates of the emails that we published are significantly after all, or all but one--it's not clear--of the hacking allegations that the DNC says have occurred.:Are any additional leaks anticipated?According to WikiLeaks, the dump was part of a ""series."" However, that outlet didn't provide a timeline for further leaks: @Rob_Hoffman We have more coming. -- WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) July 24, 2016Have the leaks thus far impacted the convention?As of early on 25 July 2016, the convention wasn't officially underway.

648,648,534.AreSocialSecurityNum,"Claim:The U.S. government assigns Social Security numbers on the basis of race.Rating:FalseAbout this rating The Social Security ""middle digit"" rumor is yet another Big Brother conspiracy theory, this one purporting that the federal government and its policies help promote racism. We're told the fifth digit of Social Security numbers denotes race, thus identifying blacks and minorities to mortgage lenders, university admissions officers, employers, and others in application processes that should be color blind. Armed with the foreknowledge of who is black and who is white, perhaps the resumes and applications of African Americans are being shuffled to the bottom of the pile.:It's a chilling thought because we know in our heart of hearts if an exploitable resource did exist for pegging sight unseen what color any of us was, there are bigots out there who would not hesitate to use it. Thankfully, it doesn't.   The e-mailed warnings quoted above are bunk; none of the digits in a Social Security number has anything to do with race. The only information 'hidden' in an SSN is where and when it was issued. Each SSN is composed of nine digits, commonly written as three fields separated by hyphens: AAA-GG-SSSS. The first three-digit field is the area number and indicates what state was listed in the applicant's mailing address when the number was issued. Someone with a mailing address in Oregon, for instance, would have a SSN beginning with 540 to 544, while the SSN of someone with a mailing address in Alabama would begin with 416 to 424.The second set of numbers (a grouping of two, which includes the supposed infamous 'race' digit) shows when the SSN was issued, not to whom. Note that it does not directly correspond to the year of issue: a 42 in this field does not indicate this particular SSN was handed out in 1942. Different states go through this two-digit code at different rates.  Moreover, when a state is done with a particular group number, the next one it begins using comes off the line according to a numbering system which makes perfect sense to the government, but to no one else. (Even so, we're going to attempt to explain it here.):Before 1965, only half of the potential group numbers were used: odd numbers below ten and even numbers above nine. In 1965, the system was changed so that assignments continued with the low even numbers and the high odd numbers. Therefore, group numbers for each area number are exhausted in the following order:  Odd numbers, 01 to 09 Even numbers, 10 to 98 Even numbers, 02 to 08 Odd numbers, 11 to 99The last four digits on an SSN are unique to the individual and are known as the series numbers. They are handed out in chronological order within each area and group number. Simply put, if two people living in the same area apply for a SSN during the same year, the first five digits of both numbers will be identical. If their applications hit the desk at the SSA at the same time, there will be a one-number difference, say, 3456 vs. 3457.:Getting back to the 'race' digit  possessed of a better understanding of how the SSA assigns that number, we find that prior to 1965, a bushelful of SSNs with even numbers in this position were  generated (45) as compared to a mere handful of odd (5). The more densely populated the area, the greater the amount of group numbers exhausted, resulting in SSNs in highly-populated areas more closely patterning themselves to the pre-1965 nine-to-one optimal result for this field. In less populated areas, however, the discrepancy between odd and even is less noticeable, because the five odd numbers are used up first (e.g., if in Alaska only twenty group numbers have been used up, then five are odd and fifteen even, resulting in a three-to-1 ratio.)From 1965 on, group numbers continue to be assigned on the above basis, but now with the second set of potential codes (49 only this time; there is no 00) being called into service when the first fifty are used up. Consequently, group codes have to achieve a ten-to-one even-to-odd imbalance before the numbers begin resetting themselves towards parity.So how does this impact the rumor?:At the wildest point of the numbering swing, the odds are 10-to-1 any given person's SSN group code is an even number. Therefore, the claim that ""I polled 35 African-Americans, 34 had an EVEN fifth digit in their SS#, the 35th person was White/Puerto Rican,"" isn't all that surprising. Especially when you consider that the five odd group numbers were handed out first, it's almost a leadpipe cinch that the SSNs of most of the people you meet will contain an even group code.All of the foregoing can be summed up thusly: The first five digits of an SSN say nothing about who the number is assigned to -- they merely reflect the state and year of issue. The last four digits are particular to the individual subscriber, but they're handed out randomly, with the sole determining factor being when the paperwork is processed. Other than his state of residence at the time of application, nothing about the SSN-holder's identity is coded into the number assigned to him.Let's face it, many of us don't trust the government. Any random tidbit that seems to confirm the rightness of that stance will be seized upon by those who already believe the worst of Uncle Sam. In this case, because Social Security numbers are constructed to conform with certain arcane and almost incomprehensible numbering schemes, it's not that far of a stretch to conclude that some of the 'secret information' encoded into them could be used against us. We already harbor mistrust over being identified by a number, and the revelation that secret stuff is going on with how the numbers are handed out only serves to heighten that anxiety.:White, black, or green, no one likes being reduced to a number; it smacks too much of governmental impersonalization, and its Orwellian overtones disturb us. In the case of African-Americans, this more general unease is further enhanced because of how their government treated them in the past, as Patricia Turner, a University of California-Davis African-American and African Studies professor noted in her book, I Heard It Through the Grapevine: Rumor in African-American Culture: There is no denying that African Americans have suffered unduly at the hands of the government. The Social Security number theory's got that sort of element of the government wanting to track Black people.  It's a theory typical of a suspicion or mistrust of the government that also exists in the non-Black community. Segments of the white community initially resisted implementation of the Social Security card system because they didn't like the idea of Big Brother government nationally numbering people""Additional information::  The SSN Numbering Scheme  (Social Security Administration) A Myth About Social Security Numbers  (Social Security Administration)"
649,649,392.AnInterestingTakeonT,"Claim:Conservative commentator William J. Bennett did penned an essay hypothesizing that Donald Trump would be killed before he could be elected President.Rating:MisattributedAbout this rating In November 2015, a conspiracy theory essay positing that Donald Trump would be assassinated before he might become President began circulating via email and online message boards. Most iterations of the essay were titled ""An Interesting Take On Trump,"" ""DONALD TRUMP: WHAT THEY ALL FEAR MOST!"" or "" ""What I See Happening In a Trump Presidency"" and attributed to conservative commentator Bill Bennett::They will kill him before they let him be president. It could be a Republican or a Democrat that instigates the shutting up of Trump. Don't be surprised if Trump has an accident. Some people are getting very nervous: Barack Obama, Valerie Jarrett, Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton and Jon Corzine, to name just a few.It's about the unholy dynamics between big government, big business, and big media.They all benefit by the billions of dollars from this partnership, and it's in all of their interests to protect one another. It's one for all and all for one.It's a heck of a filthy relationship that makes everyone filthy rich, everyone except the American people. We get ripped off. We're the patsies. But for once, the powerful socialist cabal and the corrupt crony capitalists are scared. The over-the-top reaction to Trump by politicians of both parties, the media, and the biggest corporations of America has been so swift and insanely angry that it suggests they are all threatened and frightened like never before.Donald Trump can self-fund. No matter how much they say to the contrary, the media, business, and political elite understand that Trump is no joke. He could actually win and upset their nice cozy apple cart.:It's no coincidence that everyone has gotten together to destroy The Donald. It's because most of the other politicians are part of the a ood old boys club. They talk big, but they won't change a thing. They are all beholden to big-money donors. They are all owned by lobbyists, unions, lawyers, gigantic environmental organizations, and multinational corporations ... like Big Pharma or Big Oil.The above-quoted essay was not written by Bill Bennett. It was originally posted on the web site Reality News Media on 17 September 2015 and circulated for several weeks with no attribution attached to it. It wasn't until mid-November 2015 that Bill Bennett's named started to appear alongside the title in an apparent attempt to lend credibility to the essay.Bennett's views on Donald Trump are not in line with those expressed in the essay. While the unknown author writes that Trump would make a good President since he is self-funded and does not play by the rules, Bennett said in an interview with Sean Hannity that he was not okay with a Trump presidency:Because I look at a man and the totality of his acts and his record and the things he has and stood for. And I think, probably, he's not very principled in terms of his convictions anyway, except he, you know, is a businessman who does things his way, his own idiosyncratic way.I do understand the appeal. People are angry, mad. And he seems big enough to kind of encompass that anger ...... Here's Trump with a record, you know, longer than your arm, wrong on all these things, getting all this support. That's what makes me a little angry and makes me think there's a lot of irrationality on it...... Look, if Trump's the nominee, Sean, I will support him because I won't support Hillary.:"
650,650,22.DoMoreAmericansBelie,"This article by Keith Raymond Harris is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.There is an open question among pundits and researchers: Do more Americans believe in conspiracy theories now than ever before?But as a scholar of conspiracy theories and their believers, I am concerned that focusing on how many Americans believe conspiracy theories can distract from their dangers.Even if most people dismiss conspiracy theories or accept them only in some limited sense, leaving very small numbers of true believers, the high visibility of these false ideas can still make them dangerous.Association Without Belief:Philosophers often suppose people can explain their actions in terms of what they want to do or get, and what they believe. However, many of people's actions are guided not by explicit beliefs but rather by gut feelings. These feelings aren't set in stone. They can be influenced by experience.This principle is taken to heart by advertisers who aim to influence behavior, not by changing how people think but how they feel. Manipulating feelings in this way can be accomplished by subtly associating a product with desirable outcomes like status and sex.This can also take a negative form, as in political attack ads that aim to associate an opponent with threatening imagery and descriptions. Forging similar mental associations is one way in which conspiracy theories, like other misinformation, might have consequences even without being believed. :One of the earliest political attack ads, placed by Lyndon Johnson in 1964, never even mentions its target's name.Some ExamplesConsider conspiracy theories alleging that the 2020 U.S. presidential election was rigged. Some people no doubt believe that. But even if people don't buy the whole lie, they may still believe that something about the 2020 election doesn't ""feel right,"" ""seem right"" or ""smell right."" They might, therefore, be more inclined to support efforts politicians claim will protect election integrity - even if such efforts result in targeted voter suppression.Next, consider anti-vaccination conspiracy theories. Anti-vaccination content, whether about vaccines in general or specifically about the COVID-19 vaccines, often takes the form of pictures and videos purporting to illustrate disturbing side effects of vaccines. Material of this sort can proliferate rapidly across social media and, by relying on disturbing imagery rather than explicit false claims, can often escape moderation.:Exposure to anti-vaccination information might give readers or viewers a vague feeling of unease, and consequent hesitancy concerning vaccines, even without producing explicit anti-vaccination beliefs. In fact, previous studies have shown that people who tend to rely on their intuition and who have negative emotions toward vaccines are more likely to refuse vaccination. While that research involved other vaccines, it's likely that similar factors help explain why many Americans have gone without full COVID-19 vaccination, and most have gone without boosters.:Whether they were true believers or not, Capitol rioters were influenced by conspiracy theories. AP Photo/John MinchilloPretense and CoordinationScholars often suggest that many people merely pretend to believe in conspiracy theories and other forms of misinformation as a way of expressing their political loyalties. But even pretense can be costly. Consider an analogy.When a child declares that ""the floor is lava,"" few if any believe the declaration. But that child, and others, begin to act as if the declaration were true. Those who do may clamber onto furniture, and repeat the declaration to others who enter the space. Some children play just for fun, some play to show off their climbing and jumping skills, and some play to appease the child who initiated the game.Some kids quickly tire of the game and wish to stop playing, but like or respect the child who initiated the game, and don't want to upset that person by stopping. As the game progresses, some take it too seriously. Furniture is damaged, and some get injured while attempting to leap from one raised surface to another. The lava is fake, but real things get broken.:More seriously, when Donald Trump claimed that the 2020 presidential election was ""rigged,"" some officials and ordinary citizens acted accordingly. Whether out of sincere belief, partisanship, loyalty to Trump or financial opportunism, many Americans behaved as if the 2020 election was unfairly decided.Some people acting as if the election conspiracy theory were true assembled in Washington, D.C., some stormed the Capitol building and, behind the scenes, some developed a scheme to submit fake slates of electors supporting Trump's reelection despite his loss at the ballot box. The people involved in these activities could count on the support of others who endorsed the rigged election claim, even if these endorsements were largely insincere.The price of pretendingThe costs of acting as if the 2020 election were rigged are no doubt greater than those for acting as if the floor is lava. The costs of acting as if the 2020 election were rigged led to millions of dollars worth of damage to the Capitol building, led to hundreds of arrests for Capitol rioters, led to multiple deaths and imperiled American democracy.:Given the severe risks involved, it's worth wondering why people who did not sincerely believe the election was unfair would risk pretending. This question highlights the unique danger of conspiracy theories endorsed by those in power: There can be much to gain from pretending to believe them.This article is republished from The Conversation, an independent nonprofit news source dedicated to unlocking the knowledge of experts, under a Creative Commons license.

March 4 is the date on which some pro-Trump conspiracy theorists believe he will be inaugurated for a second term.What's UndeterminedIt's not clear what the reason was for the drastic, two-day increase in room rates at Trump's Washington, D.C., hotel. :In February 2021, reports emerged that former U.S. President Donald Trump's Washington, D.C., hotel had drastically increased its room rates for March 4 -- the date on which some conspiracy theorists believe he is to be inaugurated for the second time and begin his second term as president.On Feb. 7, Business Insider published an article with the headline ""Trump's DC hotel is hiking prices for March 4, the day QAnon followers think the former president will be sworn in."" The article stated that:QAnon's most dedicated followers still believe that former President Donald Trump will soon be sworn in. They insist that Trump will return to power and be inaugurated in Washington, DC, on March 4.Coincidentally, the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, has hiked the prices of suites around that day. Some room rates at the hotel, just blocks from the White House, have almost tripled for March 3 and 4...On Feb. 6, Forbes reported that::At the Trump International Hotel in Washington DC, the least expensive room option is the deluxe king, ranging in size from 350 to 475 square feet. At this time of year, it normally runs anywhere from $476 to $596 per night.Interestingly, on March 3 and 4, the same room is selling for $1,331 per night. That's 180% above the base rate and more than double what you'd pay any other night in February or March, according to the hotel's website.Those reports contained a high degree of accuracy. Room rates at Trump's Washington, D.C., hotel were indeed remarkably high for March 3 and 4, and that sudden spike was not replicated at other five-star hotels in the nation's capital, nor at other Trump hotels. It was not possible to confirm the reason for the two-day price hike, and the ex-president's hotel company did not respond to our enquiries.AnalysisWe recorded the price of the most basic accommodation available at Trump's hotel between Feb. 28 and March 7, 2021, for one person for one night, and compared it with comparable accommodation at three other five-star hotels in Washington, D.C.: Sofitel; the Four Seasons; and Conrad Washington. We used each hotel's own website, and recorded the data on Feb. 8, 2021.:On the six days before and after March 3 and 4, the price of a night in a ""guest room"" at Trump's hotel ranged from $476 to $636. On Wednesday, March 3 and Thursday, March 4, the same room was priced at $1,331, as Forbes correctly reported. That's an overnight increase of 139% from the $556 charged for a guest on March 2, as shown below::On the following Wednesday and Thursday (March 10 and 11), the same room would cost $476.That massive, two-day spike was not at all a Washington-wide phenomenon. At Sofitel, the median (typical) cost of a ""superior room"" over the eight days was $249. On March 3 and 4, it was $258 -- just 3.8% above the median. At the Four Seasons, the typical night cost $1,020, and on March 3 and 4 it was $1,255 and $1,170, respectively -- 23% and 15% above average. And at Conrad Washington, the median cost of a ""deluxe room"" was $213, which was 31% and 22% below the rate on March 3 and 4, respectively.The rate of a slightly nicer room at Trump's hotel also spiked on March 3 and 4. Over the eight days in question, the median cost for a suite at the former president's hotel was $1,207. On March 3 and 4, it suddenly increased to $1,976 -- which is 64% higher.The March 3 and 4 price hike was also not common to all Trump's hotels -- it was specific to his Washington, D.C., establishment. At Trump's New York City hotel, a night in a ""guest room"" was priced at $540 on March 3 and 4 -- the exact same rate as the five days surrounding those dates. In Trump's Chicago hotel, the same room cost $325 per night between Feb. 28 and March 4, rising slightly to $370 on March 5 and 6. :So the sudden, drastic two-day increase in room rates at Trump's Washington D.C. hotel was real, significant, was not part of a wider trend among five-star hotels in the city, was not a regular Wednesday and Thursday event, and was not common to all Trump hotels. It therefore defies explanation, at least so far.Snopes asked Trump hotels to explain the anomaly, and invited the company to respond to speculation that it was motivated by a desire to take advantage of a possible influx into Washington, D.C., of Trump supporters who hold to the baseless conspiracy theory that Trump will be inaugurated again on March 4. We did not receive a response. If we receive any relevant, additional information or context, we will update this fact check accordingly."
652,652,701.DidModernaCEOAdmitto,"Claim:The CEO of Moderna ""admitted"" during the 2023 World Economic Forum meeting in Davos that the company was making a COVID-19 vaccine in January of 2020 ""before SARS-CoV-2 even had a name.""Rating:FalseAbout this rating ContextIt is neither a ""breaking"" revelation nor an ""admission"" that Moderna was working on a vaccine for the newly discovered coronavirus variant (then called 2019-nCoV and later renamed SARS-CoV-2) in January 2020; both Moderna and the federal government issued myriad press releases at the time. Further, mRNA vaccines like the ones Moderna had been developing well before the COVID-19 pandemic had long been considered a possible pathway to a vaccine to stop a coronavirus-driven outbreak.:A rhetorical tactic popular amongst conspiracy theorists is to paint a banal statement of fact as an accidental admission of something nefarious. A Jan. 18, 2023 tweet by an account that frequently promotes anti-vaccine conspiracy theories is a textbook definition of this phenomenon.""Breaking,"" the viral tweet read, ""Moderna CEO admits on live air at Davos they were making a COVID-19 vaccine in January of 2020 before SARS-CoV-2 even had a name."" Davos refers to the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum -- a meeting that occurs in January of each year and is a frequent target of conspiracy theorists. :First of all it is not breaking news that Moderna was working on a vaccine in January 2020. This information was widely announced and never hidden from the public. It's not even news. For example, in a Scientific American interview published on Jan. 22, 2020,  Anthony Fauci explicitly described the federal government's partnership with Moderna when he was asked how long it would take for there to be a vaccine for the then-emerging pandemic: We've already started to develop a vaccine. We got the [genetic] sequence from the Chinese. We're partnering with a company called Moderna to develop a messenger RNA-based platform for a vaccine. We will likely have a candidate in early phase I trials for safety in about three months. That doesn't mean we will have a vaccine ready for use in three months; even in an emergency, that would take a year or more. But we're already on it. Second, and not to get too pedantic, the virus that causes COVID-19 did have a name at that time: the 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV. That the nomenclature later changed to SARS-CoV-2 is not relevant to the implication that Moderna had some sort of early knowledge of a virus that -- by that point in time -- had already been sequenced in its entirety and had already made international news. :Finally, it is not a surprise that Moderna would be selected as a partner for the development of a vaccine against a coronavirus-borne pandemic. The idea that mRNA vaccines like the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines could combat a coronavirus by mimicking that virus' spike protein has been widely considered since at least 2009 in the context of creating a vaccine for SARS. Moderna's public business model since at least 2012 has been the advancement of mRNA technology. Because it is not ""breaking"" news that Moderna had been working on a COVID-19 vaccine in January 2020, and because repeating publicly available information three years after its release does not constitute an ""admission"" of any kind, we rank this claim ""False."""
653,653,359.FiveHolisticDoctorsD,"In mid-July 2015, a number of articles on the subject of recently deceased alternative health practitioners began to circulate on social media.

They were reported missing that day.This portion of the article referenced one of the five ""holistic health doctors"" who was found dead, as well as three nameless doctors who went ""missing"" in Mexico in circumstances seemingly related to each another only by date. No information was provided about what readers were supposed to infer from this information. The deceased doctor to whom the author referred was James Jeffrey Bradstreet, a controversial figure found dead of a gunshot wound in a river in June 2015. Bradstreet, 61, was subject to a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) raid shortly before his death, which police said appeared to be suicide.:As for the missing Mexican doctors, a 9 July 2015 article in the Daily Beast profiled their case and gave no indication that the individuals affected were in any way affiliated with alternative medicine or were on the radar of the FDA. In fact, there are no clear parallels between the deceased ""holistic health doctors"" included in the conspiracy theory and the missing Mexican doctors that we could find.Another portion of the article stated:June 21st, 2015 -- Father's Day: We have two dead chiropractors, Dr. Holt [33] and Dr. Hedendal [67] (both reported to be fathers), in Florida; both found on the East Coast, both were presumably healthy, and both were described as very fit. We still have no cause of death listed in the articles we can find on either one.A definitive cause of death for Hedendal has indeed been difficult to turn up, but Florida television station WBBH cited ""natural causes"" as a possibility. (Hedendal was 67 at the time of his death.) Comments on an online obituary for Hedendal included remarks (#41) from an individual named Rudy Vlaardingerbroek, who noted that::I knew Bruce well for almost twenty years. I enjoyed chatting with him and throwing the discus. On Father's Day he was at the Sunshine State Games and felt dizzy throwing the discus and even fell once. He just didn't look good acc. to other throwers, although his last throw was 133. He was given water and Gatorade, went to his car and passed away sitting there. He must have died of severe hydration, which may have led to a heart attack. We will surely miss him.As for Holt, his cause of death was indeed not readily available in searches (which have now been crowded out by conspiracy theory ramblings). An article on his death published in Raleigh News & Observer reported that that information was still pending:[Holt's] unexpected death last month while on a trip to Jacksonville, Fla. has been a blow to his family and the community he'd created through his work. Though he had been struggling with recent health issues, none were thought to be life threatening by loved ones. His family is awaiting the results from an autopsy report<.We found no indication that Hedendal or Holt had experienced run-ins with the FDA (as had Bradstreet) in recent months.:The next portion of the original article stated:June 26th, 2015 -- Dr. Patrick Fitzpatrick MD goes missing. He was traveling from North Dakota, to neighboring Montana (which he did often as his son lived there), and his truck and trailer were found on the side of the road. The search has expanded, but authorities say it's like he vanished without a trace. He's 6' tall, and described as Irish-looking, with a goatee; and details can be found on the links.Actually, Dr. Patrick Fitzpatrick of Bismarck, North Dakota was last seen on 2 July 2015. Dr. Fitzpatrick did not seem a likely candidate for a massive big pharma hit job, nor was he an ""alternative health"" practitioner of any description. Articles published about his disappearance described him as a retired ophthalmologist known for forays into nature preserves, who'd grown increasingly frail in recent years:[Lieutenant Arlyn Greydanus] says the 74-year-old suffers from medical conditions that require medicine and could suffer from confusion. He also struggles with walking great distances and walks slowly, but is believed to have possibly gotten a ride from the area where his car was abandoned.""From where the vehicle is stuck there are many different directions he could go. He's actually stuck in what's called a pea field. It's very difficult to walk through that that field was searched extensively by helicopter and you would have been able to see if someone walked through there. There's a two-track road that he drove in on and possibly walked out on,"" Lt. Greydanus said.:The article continued with the following:June 29th, 2015 -- The beloved holistic Theresa Sievers MD was found murdered in her home. Jeffrey Whiteside MD a pulmonologist went missing, vanishing when he simply ""walked away."" Dr. Whiteside, known for his successful treatment of lung cancer, disappeared in Door County, Wisconsin, while vacationing with family. They say he was on foot, and had no vehicle; and numerous reports call it ""mysterious,"" saying he too, vanished without a trace.On 29 June 2015, Theresa Sievers was bludgeoned to death in her Florida home. An investigation into Sievers' murder remains open, and law enforcement officials have declined to comment on what they've found so far. But again, we were unable to turn up any evidence suggesting Sievers had an adversarial relationship with the FDA or any other large, powerful public health agencies before she was brutally murdered, and whoever killed her left a remarkable amount of evidence (incongruent with a calculated corporate hit).On 28 February 2016, 47-year-old Mark Sievers (Dr. Sievers' spouse) was arrested and charged with second-degree murder in what police alleged was a for-hire plot to cash in on several life-insurance policies.:Another entry read:July 10th, 2015 -- Lisa Riley DO (Doctor of Osteopathic medicine) is found in her home with a gunshot wound to her head.Lisa M. Riley, 34, was indeed a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine and not an MD, but her field of practice was listed as the decidedly uncontroversial ""emergency medicine."" If Dr. Riley had cause to murderously enrage the medical establishment, that cause was well hidden.It's true that Riley's death occurred under exceptionally suspicious circumstances. She was found dead of a gunshot wound by her husband in her home on 10 July 2015, and ten days later the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) announced that Riley's husband, Yathomas Riley, would be charged in connection with her death:The Americus Office of the GBI is announcing the issuance of arrest warrants for Yathomas Riley in the death of his wife, Dr. Lisa Riley. A Lee County magistrate judge issued warrants today charging Riley with Murder, Felony Murder and Aggravated Assault in the death of Dr. Riley. The charges stem from an investigation initiated by GBI agents and the Lee County Sheriff's Office when her body was reported discovered by Yathomas Riley at their Northampton Road residence in Leesburg on July 10, 2015. Riley has remained in custody at the Lee County Jail since his arrest on July 10, 2015 for charges unrelated to his wife's death. The extensive investigation into the matter is still ongoing.:Yathomas Riley was implicated in a similar situation in 2010 involving his then-girlfriend Koketia King. That woman was shot in the head as well, and Riley claimed the wound was self-inflicted. King survived.Later articles also tied the death of Dr. Ronald Schwartz, 65, to the conspiracy. Schwartz was found shot to death in his Jupiter, Florida, home on 19 July 2015, but the deceased was neither an alternative health practitioner nor embroiled in any controversy at the time of his apparent murder. Schwartz, an obstetrician and gynecologist, was licensed in Tennessee and Georgia (not Florida) and believed to be functionally retired from medicine. His neighbors described him as quiet and reclusive.So while Bradstreet died of an apparently self-inflicted wound under increasing FDA heat (and following a recent raid), none of the other doctors subsequently tacked on to conspiracies regarding his death led similar lives. Of the four missing doctors, one was elderly and retired, and three vanished in Mexico (where they lived and worked). Dr. Holt's passing was a shock to many, but autopsy results are pending. Dr. Hedendal was 67 and passed away after a day of strenuous physical activity (presumably of natural causes). The murder of Dr. Sievers remains unsolved but was unlikely to have been carried out by high-level hitmen. Dr. Riley's husband (implicated in a similar shooting in 2010) was charged in connection with her suspicious death.:Update: On 28 August 2015, police in Missouri arrested two men in connection with the murder of Dr. Sievers. The arrests were announced in a press conference that day; Lee County Sheriff Mike Scott said that two ""vicious killers are in custody,"" but declined to elaborate with respect to the circumstances of the murders:Two men were jailed in Missouri in connection with the slaying of Bonita Springs doctor Teresa Sievers, and one of the suspects is an old friend of her husband, Mark Sievers.Curtis Wayne Wright Jr., 47, and Jimmy Rodgers, 25, face second-degree murder charges.Wright, who goes by his middle name, Wayne, has been friends with Mark Sievers since their high school days in Hillsboro, Missouri, according to mutual friends.Scott would not answer questions from reporters, saying the case was active and ongoing. He did not reveal the cause of death, manner of death or a possible motive, but he did say the case was the ""most complicated, intricate set of circumstances that most of us have ever seen."":those who deeply distrust medicine and science might take the list's assertions as plausible, but under the slightest scrutiny its claims disintegrate. Given the breadth of fields in which these individuals practiced (e.g., chiropracty, obstetrics, ophthalmology), millions of Americans could conceivably be counted among their ranks. Even if all the deaths and disappearances were suspicious (which most of them appeared not to be), five people out of millions is a very small percentage. The claims were not unlike the ""Clinton Body Count"" rumor, by which every dead person who had the slightest link to the Clintons was drafted into a broad, vague conspiracy theory. This rumor (like its predecessor) cherry-picked information that fit its narrative (such as timeframe) while discarding the facts that didn't fit (such as mainstream area of practice or later-explained circumstances/arrests).Update: On 23 July 2015 the web site Freedom Outpost published an article titled ""Two More Doctors Found Dead -- That Makes 7 in a Month,"" and on 24 July 2015 the Free Thought Project web site published an article titled ""Another Florida Doctor Murdered, Bringing Total to 8 Dead & 5 Missing in Just the Last Month.""The former claimed that the July 2015 murder of Dr. Amanda Crews (along with four other individuals) was one of the ""latest"" suspicious doctor deaths (Crews was not a holistic doctor and practiced general family medicine). Dr. Crews (along with her two children, another child, and her partner's mother) was found dead on 18 July 2015. However, Crews' former romantic partner was identified almost immediately as a suspect::Martin Martinez, 30, has been formally charged with killing his girlfriend's 2-year-old toddler last October. He was also a suspect in the Saturday homicides of girlfriend Dr. Amanda Crews, their 6-month-old daughter, her 6-year-old daughter, his mother and an unidentified 5-year-old girl. All of the deaths occurred in the homes Martinez shared with Crews, 38.Police haven't disclosed the cause of death for the five people killed in Modesto or discussed possible motives. Martinez isn't charged with their deaths, but police say he's their prime suspect.A lengthy profile published in People magazine about Dr. Crews' life and career detailed the circumstances of her family life and provided additional details about her death.Freedom Outpost's article readily admitted that Dr. Crews (who, again, was not a ""holistic doctor"") was likely murdered by a romantic partner in an act of domestic violence. The site explained that the multiple murders were likely unrelated to any other doctors' deaths, even after insinuating that doctors were being targeted and killed in a wide-ranging conspiracy::Are these doctors' deaths all related somehow? The Crews death does seem strangely off, especially considering there is a suspect in custody and that he is also suspected of killing a child in October 2014. Other than that, it seems that doctors are facing a high rate of deaths, eerily similar to bankers in the past couple of years.The Free Thought Project also cited the July 2015 death of Dr. Norm Castellano, a Tampa-area dentist, among the list of ""mysterious"" doctor deaths. Castellano (again, not a ""holistic doctor"") died on 13 July 2015, and multiple Facebook posts published by grieving friends and patients indicated that his cause of death (while not publicly disclosed) was in no way suspicious or unexplained.That web site also referenced the 21 July 2015 death of Dr. Nicholas J. Gonzalez. (While the article's title suggested a cluster of doctor deaths occurred in Florida, Gonzalez was based and died in New York.) Gonzalez was an alternative medicine practitioner, but the circumstances under which he died (as described on his web site) were not suspicious:It is with great sadness that the office of Nicholas J. Gonzalez, M.D. relays news of his untimely death on Tuesday, July 21, 2015. The cause of death was cardiac related, it appears, as he suddenly collapsed and was unable to be revived. Dr. Gonzalez was in excellent health otherwise so his passing is quite unexpected.:The rumor (currently attached to a number of separate and ostensibly unrelated tragedies) continued to suggest imaginary or tenuous links to support an assertion that the deaths were somehow connected. While headlines crowed about deaths in Florida, several of the doctors died in other states and had no obvious link to that state. Moreover, the claims centered upon the purported targeting of alternative medicine doctors despite the fact that several of the individuals included were mainstream, science-based medical providers. As the rumor spread, the inclusion of mainstream doctors across several states highlighted that the death of any doctor in July 2015 was likely to be conscripted into the (still unarticulated) conspiracy, whether or not that doctor lived in Florida or practiced alternative medicine.(Some sources have attempted to link all the deceased doctors together through the common thread of their advocacy of Globulin component Macrophage Activating Factor, or GcMAF, a protein that a handful of doctors have claimed can cure anything from cancer to autism by boosting the human immune system. However, only Dr. Bradstreet has been connected to its use.):As of March 2015, there was an estimated range of 897,000 to just over 1,000,000 doctors in the United States, and per every 100,000 people (of all vocations) each year, approximately 821 die. Going by those numbers alone, between 6,500 and 8,200 medical doctors will statistically die of myriad causes in any given year. Each month approximately 700 doctors would die (based upon the number of American doctors and the number of overall deaths), thirteen of whom could be expected to live in Florida before accounting for rate fluctuations based on whether a state (like Florida) is exceptionally populous. As such, six to eight deaths is well within the realm of expected doctor deaths."
654,654,645.DutchJournalistDebun,"On 22 December 2017, the United States' ambassador to the Netherlands was caught in a falsehood while propagating several anti-Islamic conspiracy theories during an English language interview with a Dutch reporter.Pete Hoekstra, who is a former house representative (R-Michigan), made the following remarks to the Dutch news show Nieuwsuur:Pete Hoekstra is vanaf januari de nieuwe Amerikaanse #ambassadeur in Nederland. Hij staat bekend om zijn conservatieve standpunten. Zo verzette hij zich actief tegen homorechten. Het lijkt dus geen vanzelfsprekende match. pic.twitter.com/dZnetBJvnD-- Nieuwsuur (@Nieuwsuur) December 21, 2017Footage from the program shows reporter Wouter Zwart asking Hoekstra about places in the Netherlands that even the police will not set foot because they are ""too dangerous""::Speaking of threats, at one point you mentioned in a debate that there are ""no-go zones"" in the Netherlands, and that cars and politicians are being set on fire in the Netherlands.Hoekstra, who was born in the Netherlands and emigrated to the United States as a child, responds:I didn't say that. That is actually an incorrect statement. We would call it fake news. I never said that.Zwart then shows Hoekstra footage of his remarks at a November 2015 panel, ""Muslim Migration into Europe: Eurabia come True?"" hosted by the David Horowitz Freedom Center, in which Hoekstra said:The Islamic movement has now gotten to a point where they have put Europe into chaos. Chaos in the Netherlands, there are cars being burned, there are politicians that are being burned ... And yes, there are no-go zones in the Netherlands.:After playing the clip, Zwart tells Hoekstra, ""You called it 'fake news.'"" The former congressman replies:I didn't call that fake news. I didn't use those words today. I don't think I did. In this shorter video, the replay can be watched at the :18 second mark.Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte refused to comment about the video -- which was widely distributed online -- to Nieuwsuur. Hoekstra was confirmed to his ambassadorship on 9 November 2017, and is slated to begin his service in January 2018. Prior to being named to the ambassadorial position, Hoekstra, who was in office between 1993 and 2011, was reportedly a frequent guest on a podcast hosted by anti-Muslim activist Frank Gaffney.Despite the insistence of figures like Gaffney, the idea that there are ""no-go zones"" in Europe where authorities fear to go because of the encroachment of ""Sharia law"" has been roundly debunked. Ibrahim Hooper, the director of communications for the Muslim advocacy group the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), told us that Hoekstra's remarks were representative of the kind of anti-Muslim conspiracy theories prevalent in right-wing circles::Unfortunately in this case it's coming from an ambassador of the United States to a foreign nation. It's really tragic when it reaches that level - when conspiracy theories are accepted and promoted at such a high level and not just on some hate site on the Internet.The Southern Poverty Law Center called Horowitz ""a driving force of the anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant and anti-black movements"" and said of his organization:Since its beginning, though, the Freedom Center has become the premier financier of anti-Muslim voices and radical ideologies, as well as acting as an exporter of misinformation that seeks to increase popular appeal for Horowitz's fears and phobias.Hoekstra, a former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has not publicly responded to the issue. He describes himself on his Twitter account as a ""frequent writer and commentator on intelligence issues and the threat from radical Islam.""A U.S. State Department spokesperson told us that the department had no comment. We also contacted the U.S. embassy in the Netherlands seeking comment.:"
655,655,258.WhatsinHillaryClinto,"The seemingly bottomless well of Hillary Clinton health-related conspiracy theories offered up yet another bucket of conjecture after the Democratic nominee left a 9/11 memorial ceremony due to a medical event (originally described as her ""feeling overheated"" and later attributed to pneumonia).The event produced an endlessly replayed video that showed Clinton being helped into a van by members of her security detail and apparently stumbling as she stepped off the curb to enter the vehicle, rekindling medicals rumors ranging from claims that she is prone to seizures to an assertion that she is suffering from Parkinson's disease:Hillary Clinton 9/11 NYC pic.twitter.com/q9YnsjTxss-- Zdenek Gazda (@zgazda66) September 11, 2016That video later prompted yet another conspiracy-theory-within-a-rumor when intense scrutiny of it revealed what looked to be a tubular metallic object plopping out of her right pants leg onto the ground as she was being assisted into a curbside vehicle::Of course, it wasn't possible to determine from the video whether the object in question actually fell out of her pants leg or was dropped by someone else around her, much less identify exactly what that ""mysterious"" object might have been.  That didn't prevent a wide range of speculation, however, everything from claims that the curious incident proves Hillary Clinton wears leg or hip braces to suggestions that it demonstrates she is really a cyborg or robot with a metal endoskeleton:OMG Watch #ClintonCollapse, her legs buckle & some piece of metal flies out her pantleg!! https://t.co/YHvbJjdbA5-- Deplorable FOR TRUMP (@iowa_trump) September 11, 2016:Other suggestions (veering from the plausible to the absurd) about what the object might have been included: car keys a microphone  an inhaler a phaser or communicator a lipstick a carabiner an ostomy bag clip a catheter a lighter a thumb drive (holding either deleted Benghazi e-mails or Donald Trump's tax returns) a mind control receiver a subdermal microchip a (Diazepam) pen a religious medal a crack pipe:"
656,656,507.IsDarylHannahPregnan,"Claim:Actress Daryl Hannah became pregnant in her 60s.Rating:Originated as SatireAbout this rating On Jan. 4, 2021, the Madhouse Magazine website published a story that said film actress Daryl Hannah was pregnant at age 60 with what would be her first child. She married musician Neil Young in 2018. He was 75 years at the time the website published this headline: ""Neil Young and Daryl Hannah Expecting Their First Child Together."": The Madhouse Magazine website had a disclaimer page that described its stories as satire.:This item was not a factual recounting of real-life events. The article originated with a website that labeled its stories as being satirical in nature.According to the satirical story, Hannah became pregnant at age 60 and made the announcement on social media:A spokesman confirmed that Neil Young's wife, Daryl Hannah, is pregnant. This will be the couple's first child. Young made the announcement on social media as he posted an image holding a ""Prego"" tomato sauce jar with the caption, ""We are Prego!""Hannah, 60, is in good health and is being monitored. It is quite rare to become pregnant after age 50, but she's one of a growing number of older new mothers in the United States -- a trend that's bolstered by changing societal norms and new advances in fertility treatments.Several months later, several Twitter users spread the satirical story and described Hannah as becoming pregnant at age 61, not 60, around the time of her birthday, Dec. 3.: This tweet was posted days before Hannah's 61st birthday.This reference to John F. Kennedy Jr. was about QAnon conspiracy theory supporters who really did believe he was going to come back from the dead. Of course, that was not the case. (Hannah and Kennedy Jr. previously dated before he died in a plane crash in 1999.) A tweet from Dec. 5.: The satirical story appeared to catch on in the middle of December. We saw various accounts share the satire story on this day.:A snippet from the Madhouse Magazine story was also shared as a screenshot: A section from the satirical story.:In the snippet, it said:Neil Young, 75, was giddy with excitement as he gushed at the prospect of a new baby. ""I understand we are up there in age, but don't let these old grey temples fool ya now. Just because theres snow on the roof don't mean theres no fire in the basement!"" Neil then did a few pelvic thrusts to emphasize his virility. ""You better stand back"" said Neil to the female reporters, ""You might get pregnant standing too close to me!""Giving birth at age 60 may be rare, but just last year a 74 year old woman in India gave birth to twins. ""I have the Uterus of a 20 year old and the eggs of a teenager"", said Hannah. ""There was no IVF or anything like that, me and Neil did it the old fashioned way by humping like jackrabbits.""The satirical story spread well beyond its Madhouse Magazine origins, including in a Sept. 13, 2021, article on heightzone.com. The headline read: ""Daryl Hannah Is Pregnant at the Age of 60 with Husband Neil Young, Couple Expecting a Baby Boy!"" We stumbled upon similar stories on celebsaga.com and mixedarticle.com.:We also found the purported news reposted a seemingly endless number of times on Facebook: A question with an easy answer: Hannah was not pregnant.: This appeared to be a real photograph from 2018.: It's possible that the misleading story from heightzone.com prompted a surge in new posts around Dec. 14, 2021. ""Wrong"" is certainly one way to describe ""satire."":In sum, the story about Hannah becoming pregnant was labeled as satire but later spread well beyond its origins. For this reason, we have rated this claim as ""Originated As Satire."" For background, here is why we sometimes write about satire/humor."
657,657,326.9DoctoredPicsandDeep,"Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been the subject of numerous false rumors, particularly in the form of doctored or misleading photographs and video footage.From a manipulated deepfake video of Zelenskyy supposedly telling Ukrainian soldiers to surrender to Russia to false claims he displayed Nazi logos on his clothes, there is no shortage of examples.Snopes has debunked the below-listed pieces of visual content that aim to show Zelenskyy in situations that compromise his stance as a wartime president, and/or support Russian propaganda efforts.(The entries are ranked in no particular order, and contain excerpts from Snopes' archives.)1No, Zelenskyy did not wear a neo-Nazi symbol on his shirt.In March 2022, social media users circulated images from one of Zelenskyy's daily video messages that they said showed him displaying a neo-Nazi symbol known as the ""Iron Cross"" on his t-shirt. The claim drew on the popular conspiracy theory that Zelenskyy is a neo-Nazi or holds views sympathetic to Naziism. The smear was designed to justify the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Zelenskyy, who is Jewish and whose great uncle died in the Holocaust, was not wearing a Nazi symbol on his shirt during the in-question video message. Rather, his shirt displayed a cross that is the official emblem of the Ukrainian armed forces. (You can read the full fact check here.):2No, Zelenskyy does not have a body double.We frequently debunk ""body double"" or ""clone"" conspiracy theories that target celebrities, politicians, and other public figures. In this case, claims spread online that Zelenskyy supposedly had a body double by citing images of a man following him during U.S. President Joe Biden's February 2023 visit to Ukraine.The man in question was Zelenskyy's longtime bodyguard Maksym Donets, who was appointed head of the president's personal bodyguard team in May 2019. (You can read the full fact check here.):3No, this video doesn't show Zelenskyy singing John Lennon's ""Imagine.""A March 2022 video incorrectly claimed to show Zelenskyy performing John Lennon's ""Imagine.""In reality, Alejandro Manzano -- who was the lead singer of the Florida cover band Boyce Avenue and bears a slight resemblance to Zelenskyy -- is the man performing in the video. He posted it on his YouTube page in 2017. (You can read the full fact check here.) Before that, another video of Manzano and a female singer went viral with internet users falsely claiming it showed Zelenskyy and his wife. (You can read that fact check here.):4No, this is not a real photograph of Zelenskyy in an Afro hairdo at a Pride parade.In late 2022, a photograph purportedly showing Zelenskyy wearing short shorts and an Afro hairstyle circulated on social media.It was a manipulated image; Someone had cropped an image of Zelenksyy's face and superimposed it onto a photograph of someone else with the outfit and hairstyle at the parade. (You can read the full fact check here.) 5No, Zelenskyy did not ask civilians to lay down their arms to the Russian military.In March 2022, a badly done deepfake video of Zelenskyy asking Ukrainian civilians to lay down their arms against Russia went viral. In addition to gaining attention on social media, a summary of the video was broadcast on a Ukrainian news station after it was reportedly hacked.Zelenskyy appeared to address the rumor by posting a video on his Facebook page that included the caption, ""We are at home and defending Ukraine.""

The footage spread on Telegram and on numerous Russian-language sites and blogs.The clip, however, was doctored. It was created by digitally adding cocaine and a credit card to a genuine video of Zelenskyy chatting with Musk via video call. (You can read the full fact check here.)7No, this is not a real picture of Zelenskyy holding a swastika jersey.Continuing with the trend of falsely claiming Zelenskyy has Nazi ties, in March 2022, a picture of the president holding a jersey with a swastika logo went viral. This was another piece of propaganda and was created from a genuine photograph of Zelenskyy holding a jersey of the national team of Ukraine ahead of Euro 2020.

In the clip, Manzano, who bears a slight resemblance to Zelenskyy, sings a cover of ""Endless Love"" with British singer Connie Talbot.Though Zelenskyy did have a successful entertainment career --he performed on Ukraine's ""Dancing With the Stars,"" appeared in a popular satirical television show, and more -- singing ""Endless Love"" with his wife was not part of his repertoire. (You can read the full fact check here.) :9No, this is not a real Time magazine cover labeling him ""Ladimir Elensky.""Time magazine covers frequently serve as fodder for digitally manipulated images.In April 2022, one purportedly featuring Zelenskyy and labeling him ""Ladimir Elensky"" went viral. According to the cover, the president decided to no longer use the letters ""Z"" and ""V"" because they were considered to be symbols of support for Russia.The cover was fabricated, and Zelenskyy had not altered the spelling of his name.

658,658,118.FourthMysteriousDeat,"In continuance of the decades-old, specious ""Clinton Body Bags"" narrative, the deaths of four people with supposed links to Hillary Clinton in the summer of 2016 (over a span of six weeks, not ""less than a month"") have been proffered as evidence (or at least a very strong suggestion) that those deaths are part of a nefarious plot to bump off anyone who might possess information that could bring down Clinton's campaign for the presidency.However, as is typical of this form of conspiracy theory, those four people had only the most tenuous and indirect of connections to Hillary Clinton, and the putative reasons offered for why they would supposedly need to be killed (if any reasons were offered at all) ranged from non-credible to erroneous:o On 11 July 2016, Democratic National Committee (DNC) staffer Seth Conrad Rich was shot and killed just after 4 AM in Washington, D.C. There is zero evidence behind the conspiracy theory that Rich was gunned down while on his way to meet with the FBI (at 4:00 AM?) to discuss testifying against Hillary Clinton regarding election fraud in the 2016 primaries.:As noted by Rich's hometown newspaper, the Omaha World-Herald, despite the lack of any substance to such rumors, WikiLeaks has since fanned the flames of speculation by offering a $20,000 reward for information about Rich's killer:Fevered political conspiracy theories about the death of Seth Rich have been swirling through online comment sections and websites ever since the Omaha native was gunned down early on July 10 close to his home in northwest Washington, D.C.All indications from police have been that Rich's death was most likely the result of a botched robbery -- a sadly too-common case of a promising young man cut down simply by being in the wrong place at the wrong time.But that hasn't stopped wild Internet speculation from going viral, based in part on the fact that Rich worked at the Democratic National Committee. Internet commenters have suggested that Rich was behind the disclosure of DNC emails to WikiLeaks that helped force the resignation of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida as chairwoman. The conspiracy theorists got new ammunition when WikiLeaks announced a $20,000 reward for information leading to a conviction in Rich's death.Never mind the evidence in favor of a robbery, the fact that the leaked emails were released well after his death or even that WikiLeaks itself stressed that the reward should not be taken as an implication that Rich was involved in the email leak.:Metropolitan Police Department spokesperson Alice Kim said ""there is no indication that Seth Rich's death is connected to his employment at the DNC,"" and a spokesman for the Rich family said that people ""attempting to politicize this horrible tragedy"" are ""causing more harm than good"":[S]ome are attempting to politicize this horrible tragedy, and in their attempts to do so, are actually causing more harm than good and impeding on the ability for law enforcement to properly do their job. For the sake of finding Seth's killer, and for the sake of giving the family the space they need at this terrible time, they are asking for the public to refrain from pushing unproven and harmful theories about Seth's murder.o Former U.N. Diplomat John Ashe died in June 2016, and his death was quickly followed by conspiracy claims that he was about ""to testify against Hillary Clinton in US District Court."" Although Ashe's cause of death prompted some curious speculation (it was initially reported as a heart attack but subsequently attributed to a weightlifting accident), he was not about to testify against Hillary Clinton or the DNC at the time he died -- he was set to begin pre-trial meetings related to corruption charges against himself.:o Writer Victor Thorn passed away in August 2016, by all accounts of a self-inflicted gunshot wound (i.e., suicide). Thorn wasn't anyone who had ""exposed the Clintons,"" however -- he was the author of conspiracy-mongering books contending that the Holocaust was a hoax and that Israel was responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks. His books on the Clintons were in the same vein: long on sensationalist rumor, speculation, hearsay, conspiracy theory, and ""just asking questions""-style insinuation, but short on documentation. (Examples: ""Was Bill and Hillary's much ballyhooed first meeting at Yale actually part of a much larger prearranged marriage engineered by shadowy New World Order figures whose ultimate plans led them to the White House?"" and ""Find out how during their academic careers, Bill and Hillary were recruited into the CIA under Operation CHAOS to subvert the anti-war movement."")o Shawn Lucas, best known for a viral video capturing him serving the DNC with a lawsuit in July 2016, passed away suddenly the following month. (Lucas was reportedly found dead in a bathroom; although officials have disclosed no specific cause of death yet, neither have they indicated that foul play is suspected.):Lucas was not, as subsequently portrayed in conspiracy memes, the ""lead attorney in the anti-Clinton DNC fraud case""; he was just a process server who delivered papers to the DNC notifying them of a lawsuit charging the organization with ""fraud"" in favoring Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary process. Killing a process server after the fact as a means of suppressing a lawsuit makes no sense, especially when all the principal parties involved in the lawsuit remain alive and capable of talking."
659,659,20.DubiousConspiracyThe,"In late October 2016, Slate reported on a group of internet ""malware hunters"" who had become alarmed by what appeared to be a digital link between a Trump Organization server and servers belonging to the Russian Alfa Bank. In brief, the controversy stemmed from domain name server (DNS) logs that provided a glimpse of repeated, irregular contacts between the bank and the Trump server.DNS servers essentially act as the Internet's phonebook and switchboard operation center. When you type (for example) ""Trump.com"" into a web browser, the browser connects to a DNS server, locates the IP address (a numeric code assigned to everything connected to the internet) associated with the domain name Trump.com, and then directs your browser (or email) to the corresponding server(s). As Slate reported in that 2016 piece, something seemed unusual about the DNS lookups connected with Trump and Alfa Bank servers:The irregular pattern of server lookups actually resembled the pattern of human conversation -- conversations that began during office hours in New York and continued during office hours in Moscow. It dawned on the researchers that this wasn't an attack, but a sustained relationship between a server registered to the Trump Organization and two servers registered to an entity called Alfa Bank.:In an additional eyebrow-raising discovery, Slate reported that the Trump server was programmed only to communicate with a small number of IP addresses. Alfa Bank was by far the most frequent address to appear in those logs, and a server belonging to the company Spectrum Health came in, Slate reported, a distant second:When the researchers pinged the server, they received error messages. They concluded that the server was set to accept only incoming communication from a very small handful of IP addresses. A small portion of the logs showed communication with a server belonging to Michigan-based Spectrum Health.Some news outlets have been skeptical of the claims raised in the Slate article and have offered benign explanations for the phenomenon. However, both Alfa Bank and Spectrum Health do have established connections to the Trump administration or campaign.The first person sentenced in Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was Alex Van Der Swan (who pled guilty to lying to the FBI). An attorney for ex-Trump campaign Chairman Paul Manafort, Van Der Swan is married to the daughter of the Russian oligarch who owns the Alfa banking conglomerate. Additionally, President Trump's controversial appointee to run the Justice Department's criminal division, Brian Benczkowski, once represented Alfa Bank.:Spectrum Health is run by current Secretary of Education Betsy Devos' husband, a Michigan-based healthcare system that comprises 12 hospitals, 18 urgent care facilities, and 48 laboratory centers. Devos' brother, private security firm Blackwater founder Erik Prince, has additionally come under scrutiny, in part for his alleged efforts to set up a backchannel of communication with Russian officials during a January 2017 meeting in Seychelles.The Theory That Putin's Daughter Played a Role in These Alleged CommunicationsAs if the above set of circumstances were not enough for those interested in nefarious-seeming government conspiracies, a new rumor appeared on Facebook in July 2018 suggesting that Putin's daughter was somehow involved in whatever those DNS logs may have uncovered.A highly-shared social media post (inexplicably accompanied by an image of Melania Trump in a revealing outfit) made the argument that Putin's daughter, because she is reportedly an endocrinologist and because Spectrum Health has an endocrinology department, must have had some role in setting up this server communication channel::Well here's a funny little coincidence --Mariya Putin, Vlads [sic] eldest daughter just so happens to run a children's endocrinology charity, [sic] guess who specializes in endocrinology? Spectrum Health of Michigan. The same site that all the computer traffic was going to and from Trump Tower and Alfa Bank of Russia. Spectrum Health is owned by Betsy Devos.That, ladies and gentlemen is called an implausible coincidence. Devos didn't get a cabinet position because she was qualified (an understatement)! She got that job because she's right smack in the middle of all this! They used her companies [sic] computer servers to communicate with the Russians and they thought no one would notice! I'm sure she's terrified right about now. If we all know what she did you can best be sure Robert Mueller knows what she did.Elements of that post were also encapsulated in a less risque meme::The identity of Putin's children has been a closely guarded state secret since his rise to power in the late 1990s. However, in January 2016, the Moscow-based independent news magazine The New Times  reportedly identified his eldest daughter as a woman who goes by the name Maria (or Mariya) Vladimirovna Vorontsov. At the time of that article's publication, Maria had received an advanced degree in endocrinology from Moscow State University's Functional Medicine Department.On 18 July 2018, Russia24 (a state-run Russian news channel) ran a segment on an endocrinology conference that featured an interview with Maria Vorontsov. In that segment, Vorontsov was introduced as a pediatric endocrinologist and research assistant at the Russian Ministry of Health's Endocrinology Research Center. This event inspired speculation that Putin's (alleged) daughter was a patron of that center.Taking the claims that Putin's daughter is a pediatric endocrinologist who funds an endocrinology research center as fact, we note that the connection to Spectrum Health would still revolve around only a shared involvement in endocrinology. The viral Facebook post asserted that ""Spectrum Health of Michigan"" ""specializes"" in endocrinology, but while ""Spectrum Health of Michigan"" is neither the name of the company nor the name of any of their facilities, Spectrum Health's website do describe their Helen DeVos Children's Hospital as the largest children's endocrinology program in the state of Michigan.:While there are legitimate questions to be asked about the odd connections between servers owned by Spectrum Health, the Trump Organization, and Alfa Bank (and some of those questions are likely part of Robert Mueller's investigation), the suggestion that Putin's daughter had any role in whatever communications were occurring with the Trump Organization server requires belief that it is an ""implausible coincidence"" for Putin's daughter to be an endocrinologist at the same time that a DeVos-run hospital has an endocrinology department."

Claims of ""depopulation,"" for instance, come from the distortion of a statement made by Bill Gates in 2009 that conspiracy theorists falsely assert betray his desire to kill humans with vaccines to prevent overpopulation. Snopes interprets ""mandatory multiple v"" as a reference to mandatory vaccines, but we note that this is not the terminology the U.N. itself typically uses to describe vaccinations. Claims of a ""microchipped society"" are also related -- in part -- to Gates and vaccines. Snopes broke apart these baseless conspiracy theories in April 2020. Snopes discussed meritless conspiracies surrounding a ""China-like"" social credit system implemented on a global scale in December 2022. :The assertion that the U.N wants to put an end to privately owned property (including farms, single family homes, businesses, transportation, etc) stems from misreading an opinion piece theorizing about what the future might look like. This controversy, Snopes explained in April 2023, concerns the World Economic Forum, not the U.N.

662,662,106.DidaMandalayBayHotel,"Claim:Mandalay Bay Hotel worker Chad Nishimura ""vanished"" after giving a reporter a description of the suspected Las Vegas gunman that clashed with the ""official narrative.""Rating:FalseAbout this rating Among the many conspiracy theories surrounding the October 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada is one that involves Chad Nishimura, a Mandalay Bay Hotel valet worker who said he parked suspected shooter Stephen Paddock's car on his arrival at the hotel. :According to conspiracy theorists, Nishimura told a reporter in his native Hawaii that Paddock did not appear to have many bags with him, thus contradicting the ""official"" narrative that Paddock acted alone, and prompting Nishimura's sinister disappearance.  On 10 October 2017, the disreputable and rarely accurate web site Neon Nettle wrote: A valet worker from the Mandalay Bay hotel, who parked the suspected Las Vegas shooting gunman's car, has mysteriously vanished after giving an interview saying Stephen Paddock was a ""normal guy"" who ""didn't have many bags.""There is no evidence that Nishimura has disappeared or been reported missing, and this account contains several important factual errors and logical mistakes, typical of much of the content that Neon Nettle and other sites of its ilk publish.It is true that Nishimura spoke to KITV 4, a Honolulu ABC affiliate, for an article published on 3 October 2017 that has since been deleted::A Kamehameha graduate working as a valet at the Mandalay Bay Resort said he parked the shooter's car on Saturday. The gunman, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, checked his car into the hotel on Saturday morning. Valet Chad Nishimura, who is from Mililani, said he spoke briefly with Paddock. ""Just in shock, really. It's scary to know that I was close to someone that was that dangerous. I would've never thought. He seemed like a normal guy. When he came in, nothing too weird about him. He didn't have any crazy bags with him that I can remember. We are a convention hotel so we have a bunch of people that have boxes and multiple carts worth of stuff. There's nothing weird that I can remember,"" Nishimura said.(An archived version of the story can be viewed here.)The first thing to note here is that Nishimura did not say Stephen Paddock didn't have many bags. He said Paddock didn't have any ""crazy bags"" and brought ""nothing weird"" that he could could remember. Further, it requires a logical leap to propose that if Stephen Paddock didn't have much luggage with him upon arriving at the Mandalay Bay Hotel, it follows that he must have had an accomplice in the 1 October 2017 mass shooting. Nothing in Nishimura's account of meeting Paddock eliminates the possibility that Paddock made multiple trips to the hotel, therefore making that particular conspiracy theory surrounding Nishimura fall down on this logical point alone. :Neon Nettle also attributes the removal of the KITV 4 article to ""higher-ups at ABC taking issue with a report that conflicts with the narrative they are pushing on the public,"" and falsely states that the reporter Moanike'ala Nabarro had declined to answer readers who asked why the story had been deleted. In fact, Nabarro gave a clear answer to this question on 7 October 2017, three days before Neon Nettle published its story, saying that the decision was made in order to protect Nishimura's privacy:Mililani native says he spoke to shooter before checking his car into the valet at Mandalay Bay- https://t.co/GjkRE9HRVk-- Moanike'ala Nabarro (@moanikitv) October 3, 2017Finally, there is no evidence that Chad Nishimura has ""vanished"" -- mysteriously or otherwise -- and in fact, there is evidence to contradict this claim. :According to Neon Nettle, Nishimura ""has completely vanished since the report was published, with all of his social media accounts being scrubbed from the internet.""This is completely and provably false. Nishimura has been active on Facebook after 3 October, the publication date of the KITV 4 article which -- at least according to the conspiracy theory being pushed here -- prompted his ""disappearance"". (His Facebook account remains active, but we are not linking to it in the interest of protecting Nishimura's privacy from readers provoked by the groundless conspiracy theory peddled and promulgated by Neon Nettle and others.)On 5 October 2017, Nishimura wrote:I'm okay everyone, I was at the concert the night before, thankfully cut my wristband off and didnt [sic] go on Sunday. However I did park the shooters [sic] car...Thats been the rough part for me. :Furthermore, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department has not listed Nishimura as a missing person.This conspiracy theory is illogical, not supported by any evidence, contradicted by other evidence, and is false. Neon Nettle has a history of publishing inaccurate conspiracy theories, hoaxes and other fabricated content.  The Chad Nishimura case joins a laundry list of conspiracy theories and hoaxes revolving around the October 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas. "
663,663,422.PersonWhoLeakedHilla,"Claim:The CIA found a ""dead man's switch"" on the computer of the deceased father of a doctor treating Hillary Clinton for dementia.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In July 2015, Hillary Clinton's personal physician, Dr. Lisa Bardack, issued a public letter affirming that the candidate is ""in excellent condition and fit to serve as President of the United States."" Presidential candidates typically have their doctors release such statements, but this instance was particularly noteworthy because the Democratic presidential nominee has been beset by unfounded rumors holding that she is prone to seizures and is concealing some serious neurological condition.:In August 2016, someone issued a hoax ""leak"" of purported medical records from Dr. Bardack supposedly documenting that, contrary to what the physician had asserted in public, Hillary Clinton was experiencing ""more frequent"" seizures and showed signs of ""advancing"" dementia.Shortly afterwards, the notorious conspiracy-pushing outlet WhatDoesItMean.com  published a fabricated article reporting that Vincent Fleck, the ""father of the doctor treating [Hillary Clinton] for dementia"" and the ""leaker"" of those records, had died under mysterious circumstances:The Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) is reporting today that the continuing to grow list of mysterious deaths surrounding US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has increased after the father of the doctor treating her for dementia suddenly died this past weekend -- and who is believed to have been behind the leaking of her most secret medical records. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]:The SVR first became ""alerted/alarmed"" regarding the circumstances of this latest mysterious death associated with Hillary Clinton on 17 July, this report says, when a ""known/suspected"" Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) ""hit team"" traveled about 70 kilometers (44 miles) from their New York City ""base/headquarters"" to a small village named Mount Kisco, both being located in New York State.Upon arriving in Mount Kisco, this report continues, this CIA ""hit team"" broke into a specialized small computer security companies annex office named Right Click Solutions, located at 322 East Main Street, but were ""shocked/surprised"" by the unexpected arrival of an off duty employee -- who immediately called the local police forces when he noticed the break in -- and who were only able to obtain a single laptop computer.An ""electronic interrogation"" of this company and its customers to ascertain the CIA's interest in it, this report says, revealed an anomaly where this computer security company had installed a ""Snowden-like dead man's switch"" on the personal computer of man named Vincent Fleck. [Note: The ""dead man's switch"" refered to by the SVR in this report relates to a software programme that will automatically distribute information should something happen to the owner.]:It is true that news accounts reported the death of a Vincent Fleck of Mount Kisco, who passed away from drowning or a medical event suffered while competing in a triathalon in early August 2016. However, all the rest of the story about a CIA ""hit team"" finding a ""dead man's switch"" on Vincent Fleck's computer is a fabrication, as is the claim about Dr. Daniel Fleck's treating Hillary Clinton for dementia. (It's rather unlikely a physical therapist with a regular practice specializing in sports injuries would be furtively treating a high-profile politician campaigning throughout the country for dementia.)As reflected in the example tweets reproduced above, many readers inferred that Dr. Daniel Fleck himself had died mysteriously, but we confirmed with a beleaguered employee at his practice (beset with phone calls about the conspiracy rumors) that the physician was alive and well.Vincent Fleck was the fourth individual ""connected"" to Clinton by WhatDoesItMean.com as part of a series of fabrications suggesting people who posed risks to Clinton's power were being serially murdered. Previously, the outlet falsely claimed hacker Guccifer (Marcel Lazar Lehel) was missing and presumed dead after he purportedly hacked into Clinton's e-mail, and claimed former UN official John Ashe was murdered on the eve of scheduled testimony against Clinton. The site also used the tragic unsolved murder of Democratic National Committee (DNC) staffer Seth Rich to germinate a baseless conspiracy theory that ultimately caused the young man's family additional sorrow in an already harrowing period of grief. :Guccifer was confirmed alive and well by officials at the facility in which he was housed, and a federal prosecutor's office affirmed Ashe's legal troubles were in no way connected to Clinton. Rich's murder remains unsolved, but his family has pled with the public not to engage in painful speculation about the circumstances of his killing. All four rumors were started by a blogger known by the nom de plume ""Sorcha Faal."" RationalWiki says of Faal's ""sensational"" and ""outrageous"" WhatDoesItMean.com conspiracy site that:Sorcha Faal is the alleged author of an ongoing series of ""reports"" published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don't think much of it.Each report resembles a news story in its style but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don't contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish.:Before the recent series of Clinton-related fabrications,Sorcha Faal claimed President Obama had ordered the military to attack the city of Charleston with nuclear weapons (which didn't happen), Rear Admiral Rick Williams was fired because he revealed Obama's purchase of a mansion in Dubai (Williams was terminated for misconduct), and Vladimir Putin and Barack Obama were engaged in a potentially conflict-starting dispute over the practices of Monsanto."
664,664,57.ConspiracyTheoriesMa,"This article is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.There has been a proliferation of conspiracy theories about COVID-19 that either reject the existence of the virus altogether or question the official account of its origins, its mode of transmission, its effects and its remedies. Many of these theories are highly implausible and harmful and it has become commonplace to describe them as irrational - even delusional. But it is not plausible to describe them as signs of mental illness. Quite the opposite. Our research has shown that many irrational beliefs are attempts to protect mental health by responding to the human need for control, understanding and belonging. The most radical theory about COVID-19 is denialism: the virus does not exist or is not as dangerous as is commonly believed. For some deniers, COVID-19 cannot be caught at all because germ-based transmission itself is a myth. For others, it is just a ""common cold"" and its alleged lethal effects are overplayed. Powerful individuals and organisations (such as Bill Gates or Big Pharma) are considered responsible for the hype, with motives ranging from making money to suppressing freedom.:Some conspiracy theorists believe COVID-19 was created in a lab like this one.Shutterstock/MongkolchonAkesinAnother popular theory denies that the virus passed from non-humans to humans accidentally. It was, instead, intentionally crafted by the Chinese in a lab in Wuhan. Other theories blame the quick and devastating proliferation of the virus on genetically modified crops or to the roll out of 5G technology. All these theories share some common features. There is always some sort of murky plot that conflicts with official accounts, and they are usually based on limited or discredited evidence. But these common features are grounded in some basic needs that all humans share.Seeking hope - and an explanationWhy do people fall for a plot? At the bottom, there is a powerful drive for causal understanding. In a novel situation, people need a causal map to navigate the environment. They may settle for an explanation before they have all the relevant information, because uncertainty is hard to tolerate. In a pandemic scenario, the explanation may be filling a gap caused by doubt and division among experts. This is definitely the case with COVID-19. Scientists have expressed disagreement about many aspects of COVID-19, from the severity of the threat to the effectiveness of face coverings (this is, of course, the process of scientific research).:As our previous research highlighted, people tend to prefer explanations that make reference to a person's intentions over explanations that present the event as accidental. In particular, they tend to blame a threat on ""agents"" they may already have reason to distrust. This is why various COVID-19 conspiracy theories blame ""the Chinese"" who have long been political targets in Europe and the US, or pharmaceutical companies whose influence is criticised in the anti-vax and anti-psychiatry movements.Seeing the event as planned rather than accidental allows people to maintain a sense of control over a reality that is confusing and unpredictable. If there is someone to blame, we can restore some kind of balance to the universe by seeking to punish the culprits for their evil conduct. Also, we can prevent them from harming us next time. This illusion of control contributes to our optimism about the future and helps us cope effectively with adversity.Rejecting evidence:But why do people commit to a theory that is incompatible with accepted wisdom even when the evidence for it is inconclusive? The conflict with an official version arises from distrust towards institutions such as governments, scientists, the media and medical authorities. This distrust drives the belief in a conspiracy and is central to the identity of groups that people already associate with.Conspiracy theories tend to originate within so-called ""epistemic bubbles"". These are social structures in which opposing voices are, more or less deliberately, excluded. This typically happens in self-selected social media networks like Facebook groups or Twitter exchanges where those with a different view are blocked. Within these bubbles, theories about COVID-19 become something that defines who the people are and what they stand for.Each bubble has its own standards to evaluate expertise and evidence. Some conspiracy theorists mistrust statistics and for some COVID-19 deniers the experts are not the epidemiologists, but the holistic health gurus. If people are trapped in an alternative bubble it may not be irrational (from their point of view) to endorse a theory that is consistent with their previous convictions and matches the testimony of others in their group. The theory is a way of imposing meaning on a constantly changing world.:This suggests that to counter the spread of conspiracy theories, we should find other ways to fulfil the needs from which they arise, such as the need for control or for causal understanding. Although we have no control over the fact that there is a pandemic, it can be empowering to realise that our behaviour in response to it - such as wearing a mask or respecting social distance - can make a difference to its outcomes. And although experts cannot always provide the unfaltering certainties people crave, friendly and accessible scientific communication can help debunk conspiracy theories and satisfy the human desire for knowledge and understanding.:Lisa Bortolotti, Professor of Philosophy, University of Birmingham and Anna Ichino, Postdoctoral Fellow in Philosophy, University of MilanThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Jones is being sued by the parents of murdered Sandy Hook elementary school children for defamation, after years of his claiming the victims were ""crisis actors"" and driving a campaign of harassment against them.The mere presence of the Star of David on a vehicle traveling with the migrant caravan is, of course, not proof that George Soros, a Jewish Holocaust survivor, funded it. The philanthropic Soros does donate to programs that help migrants, as do some Jewish charities. But the migrants, who set out from Honduras in mid-October on foot, are fleeing violence and poverty in their home countries and are not coming to the U.S. as part of a Jewish-led scheme to ""invade"" America.The Fellowship of the Minds story and others like it play on the ""white genocide"" conspiracy theory, a belief held by white supremacists that Jewish people are engineering the destruction of the white race through immigration. In the lead-up to the Pittsburgh synagogue attack, Robert Bowers, the man arrested and charged with the crimes, wrote a series of messages on social media in which he appeared to reference that conspiracy theory::Bowers posted a link to a page from the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), a Jewish nonprofit that aids refugees. The HIAS link listed congregations across the country that held Shabbat services this month for refugees -- including several synagogues in Pittsburgh.""Why hello there HIAS! You like to bring in hostile invaders to dwell among us? We appreciate the list of friends you have provided,"" Bowers wrote.In a post about two hours before the shooting, Bowers wrote: ""HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in.""Soros is a hedge fund billionaire and philanthropist who often donates to progressive causes and is the frequent target of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. In the week leading up to the synagogue shooting, Soros, the CNN cable news network, and several prominent members of the Democratic party were targeted with mailed pipe bomb devices that failed to detonate.Since a Central American migrant caravan set out from Honduras in mid-October, politicians including President Donald Trump have continuously fear-mongered about it. The caravan comprises roughly 3,500 people traveling north as of 31 October 2018, but they are still in southern Mexico, and their numbers have dwindled drastically from previous estimates of 7,000. Nevertheless President Trump has sent 5,200 active duty troops to the border and says he will send more as the midterm elections loom on 6 November 2018.:"

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. An increasingly resilient class of coronavirus rumors asserts that SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19, was created in a lab. Most iterations of the rumor claim the virus was accidentally released from a high-level infectious disease research lab in Wuhan, China -- the purported origin of the outbreak -- and some suggest the virus itself was designed there to be a ""bioweapon.""  This post addresses the origins of these rumors and exposes the falsehoods and scientific realities that undermine such claims.OriginsWhen early reports of what would later become known as COVID-19 spread through the city of Wuhan in late 2019, a shared trait among many of the first patients was that they had been to the Huanan seafood market, a live animal market theorized to be the origin of the COVID-19 outbreak. Wuhan -- a city of over 11 million -- also has at least two infectious-disease research labs. One, the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, is apparently less than a mile from the Huanan market. The other, the State Key Laboratory of Virology (sometimes referred to as the Wuhan Institute of Virology), is a biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) laboratory certified to handle the world's most deadly pathogens. This higher security lab is located about 7 miles from the Huanan market.:While the higher security lab in Wuhan has worked with coronaviruses, it does not appear that the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention -- the one close to the market -- had published any research on the topic prior to the pandemic. Both labs, however, have studied viral samples sourced from bats. Virology research work often involves bats, a proposed source of the novel coronavirus' transfer from animal to human, because they harbor a uniquely large reservoir of viruses compared to other mammals. Research on coronaviruses is an important focus of China's scientific efforts ever since the 2002 SARS epidemic, which was also caused by a coronavirus.The proximity of these labs to the Huanan seafood market and these labs' history with at least tangentially related infectious disease research are the only factual elements to the ""created-in-a-lab"" theory that are undisputed, rather than speculative or rooted in false scientific claims. For example, it is factual to state that the Chinese government hid, downplayed, and misrepresented to its citizens and the world the threat posed by the novel coronavirus. It is speculative, however, to assert, as U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton did, that these actions were done to cover up a leak from a lab.:Several evidentiary gaps exist between the observation of virology labs close or somewhat close to a market where early COVID-19 cases were identified and the conclusion that the Chinese government is covering up for the fact that they accidentally released an engineered viral agent from one of these labs. In conspiracy theory circles, these gaps have been filled with extremely flawed or bogus science, the incorrect interpretation of existing science, or both. Not only do these arguments -- discussed in detail below -- lack merit on their own, factual scientific studies concerning the origin of SARS-CoV-2 actually provide the strongest refutation to date of the claim the virus was ""created in a lab.""Did a 'Scientific Study' Conclude the Coronavirus Escaped from a Lab?A February 2020 document erroneously described by several media outlets as a ""scientific study"" provides the supposedly science-based evidence of a virus escaping from a lab.:This paper, such as it is, merely highlights the close distance between the seafood market and the labs and falsely claimed to have identified instances in which viral agents had escaped from Wuhan biological laboratories in the past. With those two elements, half of them factual, the authors come to the sweeping conclusion that ""somebody was entangled with the evolution of 2019-nCoV coronavirus,"" and ""the killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan."" While SARS viruses have escaped from a Beijing lab on at least four occasions, no such event has been documented in Wuhan.The purported instances of pathogens leaking from Wuhan laboratories, according to this ""study,"" came from a Chinese news report (that we believe, based on the similarity of the research described and people involved, to be reproduced here) that profiled a Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention researcher named Tian Junhua. In 2012 and 2013, he captured and sampled nearly 10,000 bats in an effort to decode the evolutionary history of the hantavirus. In two instances, this researcher properly self-quarantined either after being bitten or urinated on by a potentially infected bat, he told reporters. These events, according to the 2013 study his research produced, occurred in the field and have nothing to do with either lab's ability to contain infective agents. The paper also asserts without evidence that infectious waste was merely tossed out of the lab closer to the market as regular trash.:In sum, this paper -- which was first posted on and later deleted from the academic social networking website ResearchGate -- adds nothing but misinformation to the debate regarding the origins of the novel coronavirus and is not a real scientific study.Does the Novel Coronavirus Contain HIV-Related Genes?Another line of pseudoscientific reasoning concerns claims that the virus is just too perfectly built to infect humans to be a virus of natural origin. A big talking point in this space stems from a paper that was later retracted by the authors themselves. On Feb. 2, a team of Indian researchers released a non-peer-reviewed preprint of a paper asserting to have found ""uncanny"" similarities between amino acid structures in SARS-CoV-2 and HIV. ""The finding,"" they argued, ""is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature,"" seemingly implying a level of human engineering behind the virus.:The paper was swiftly retracted by the authors, according to STAT News, with commenters noting the study's rushed methods and likely coincidental, if not entirely incorrect, conclusion. A Feb. 14 paper, this one peer-reviewed, ""demonstrated no evidence that the sequences of these four inserts are HIV-1 specific or the [SARS-CoV-2] viruses obtain these insertions from HIV-1.""Speaking to Snopes by email, Robert Garry, an infectious disease expert at Tulane University who has published on the origins of SARS-CoV-2, told us by email that ""the so-called HIV sequences are very short -- nothing more than random chance.""Such a reality has not stopped pseudoscientific internet personalities from incorporating these already discredited results into misinformed conspiracy theories while pushing vaccine skeptical content. Is SARS-CoV-2 A 'Chimera' Virus Built from HIV, Flu, and SARS?:On March 8, 2020, (and again on March 22) -- well after the aforementioned HIV paper was retracted and refuted -- Joseph Mercola, an alternative medicine guru behind the website Mercola.com, published an ""expert interview"" with Francis Boyle, a lawyer with no formal training in virology. This interview managed to merge all of the previously described false scientific claims into one narrative that has been shared widely online. In that interview, Boyle asserted:The COVID-19 virus is a chimera. It includes SARS, an already weaponized coronavirus, along with HIV genetic material and possibly flu virus.There is this Biosafety Level 4 facility there in Wuhan. It's the first in China, and it was specifically set up to deal with the coronavirus and SARS. SARS is basically a weaponized version of the coronavirus.There have been leaks before of SARS out of this facility, and indeed the only reason for these BSL-4 facilities, based on my experience, is the research, development, testing and stockpiling of offensive biological weapons.Boyle's knowledge, he stated explicitly in this interview, does not come from having worked for the U.S. government, from having any sort of security clearance, or from having ""access to any type of secret information."" It is unclear, then, what experience he is basing the false claim that ""the only reason for these BSL-4 facilities ...  is the research, development, testing and stockpiling of offensive biological weapons."":""The purpose of the BSL-4 labs,"" Garry told us, ""is to design the countermeasures (diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines) to these pathogens."" He added that he knows ""many American scientists that collaborate with the Wuhan Institute of Virology,"" and that it ""does not have any offensive bioweapons development capability."" In response to the weapon stockpile claim, North Carolina State University epidemiology Professor Matt Koci told us ""the idea that level 4 labs are only for weaponizing pathogens [and] that people go and find diseases then weaponize them ... makes no sense."" The remaining assertions appear to have their roots in the two previously debunked claims from above: No, Wuhan's labs do not have documented cases of accidental SARS releases. No, HIV sequences are not a feature of SARS-CoV-2. Garry told us that ""SARS-CoV-2 may well prove to be a recombinant virus"" -- i.e., one that has viral components sourced from viruses originating in multiple animals -- ""but this occurred in nature, not in the lab."" It is not, as has been suggested, some sort of creation built by mixing the most extreme parts of known human viruses together. ""There is no evidence to support that claim,"" Koci told us.:With those bogus scientific claims stripped away, we are left with the same circumstantial evidence present at the top of the story: A virology lab (which does not appear to have worked on coronaviruses) exists in close proximity to the proposed origin of the outbreak, and another, higher-security lab that has worked on coronaviruses is located miles away from the market.Could science, alternatively, help to rule out the possibility SARS-CoV-2 was created in a lab? Indeed, the actual peer-reviewed research on the deadly adaptations present in the virus are also the strongest argument yet against the notion that it has been engineered.Scientific Reality: Genomic Data Undercut Claims of an Engineered VirusViruses, in general, are tiny fragments of DNA or RNA coated with protein that insert themselves into an organism's cells. Once there, the virus consumes a cell's resources and makes copies of itself. The cell dies and the newly created viral material is free to infect other cells. Though viruses do evolve via natural selection like living organisms, their inability to create their own energy through metabolism generally precludes them from being considered alive.:Coronaviruses are a class of ""enveloped"" RNA viruses. They protect themselves with an outer envelope of lipid material. Coronaviruses, in particular, have spikes that point out of this envelope of protection, a feature that can aid in the infection of cells.Until the early 2000s, there was limited scientific interest in human coronaviruses, as they only seemed capable of creating mild cold symptoms. The 2002 SARS epidemic, caused by a coronavirus, flipped that conventional wisdom on its head. This particular coronavirus had a new adaptation: the ability for those pointy spikes to bind to a chemical in human blood called Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). This adaptation, scientists argue, is what allowed the SARS coronavirus to jump from an animal to a human and cause disease.The new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, also contains this adaptation, but an even stronger variant of it. As described by Ed Yong in The Atlantic, ""the exact contours of SARS-CoV-2's spikes allow it to stick far more strongly to ACE2 than SARS-classic did."" The novel coronavirus also has another adaptation that makes it good at infecting humans. Spike proteins are composed of two halves and activate only when a chemical ""bridge"" is broken. In SARS-CoV-2, Yong wrote, ""the bridge that connects the two halves can be easily cut by an enzyme called furin, which is made by human cells and -- crucially -- is found across many tissues."" Not only do these spikes bind strongly to human cells, in other words, but the chemical required to initially activate those spikes happen to be prevalent throughout the human body.:These two adaptations are the features of the coronavirus that cause speculation about it being engineered to kill. The problem, according to a team of researchers who analyzed the genome of SARS-CoV-2 for a March 2020 paper in Nature Medicine, is that if someone wanted to design a virus using methods currently available to science, scientists would not have solved the problem the way nature apparently did, because scientists wouldn't have predicted it to be a viable solution in the first place.Over a decade of research following the first SARS outbreak has allowed scientists to develop computer models that predict, among other things, what human chemicals a theoretical coronavirus could bind to and how strong that bond would be. When researchers plug the new coronavirus into these models, they correctly predict it binds to ACE2, but incorrectly conclude it to be a weaker bond than SARS-1. In other words, if scientists wanted to create a deadly coronavirus as a weapon, the tools available to them would have suggested the SARS-CoV-2 model would be a waste of time. This, the study's authors argue, is evidence that the spike adaptation is ""most likely the result of natural selection."":To that point, while the most similar known animal virus to SARS-CoV-2 is currently found in bats, similar coronaviruses also have been found in pangolins -- a kind of anteater. While less similar as a whole, these pangolin viruses have similar spike genetics to the novel human coronavirus. This, they say, is further evidence of natural selection. ""The pangolin viruses were sequenced after the COVID pandemic started,"" explains Tulane's Garry, who was an author on the Nature Medicine paper. ""So yeah -- this is a natural thing that no one in a lab would have or could [have] designed."" Such a reality undercuts claims of ""chimera"" viruses intentionally spliced together by humans, since humans didn't know these specific spikes existed until after the pandemic began.As for the second notable SARS-CoV-2 adaptation -- the one that allows a chemical in human blood to activate the coronavirus spikes -- this specific modification has not yet been found in nature. However, the authors noted, genetic ""mutations, insertions, and deletions"" do naturally occur in the portion of RNA that would create it. This, they argue, demonstrates that such an adaptation could, theoretically, ""arise by a natural evolutionary process."":In a commentary piece about this study, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins wrote ""this study leaves little room to refute a natural origin for COVID-19."" Though researchers do not yet have a clear idea of the exact origin or evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2, the authors of the Nature Medicine paper provide two potential scenarios, described here by Collins:In the first scenario, as the new coronavirus evolved in its natural hosts, possibly bats or pangolins, its spike proteins mutated to bind to molecules similar in structure to the human ACE2 protein, thereby enabling it to infect human cells. This scenario seems to fit other recent outbreaks of coronavirus-caused disease in humans, such as SARS, which arose from cat-like civets; and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which arose from camels.The second scenario is that the new coronavirus crossed from animals into humans before it became capable of causing human disease. Then, as a result of gradual evolutionary changes over years or perhaps decades, the virus eventually gained the ability to spread from human-to-human and cause serious, often life-threatening disease.:Researchers do not yet know enough about the new coronavirus to determine which of those two scenarios is more likely, but scientists do know enough to conclude it to be extremely unlikely to have been engineered in a lab for any purpose, including bioweaponry.The Bottom LineThe theory that SARS-CoV-2 was manufactured in, and escaped from, a lab in Wuhan is based solely on the proximity of infectious-disease labs near a potential source of the COVID-19 outbreak. Several ""scientific"" claims have been made or manufactured to further bolster the notion that something nefarious is going on with COVID-19 and these labs, but this information comes from non-peer-reviewed papers misconstrued to be actual additions to the scientific record, or from disreputable websites like Mercola.com. The actual scientific facts known about the novel coronavirus leave little room for it to be a virus of human creation, however.:We have little reason to doubt nature is capable of producing a virus like this. After all: ""Nature has already created more than enough pandemic threats,"" Garry told us."
667,667,486.CanTeachersHearMuted,"Claim:Zoom allows hosts of meetings, such as educators, to hear participants whose microphones are turned off.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In early 2021, Snopes became aware of viral TikTok videos that alleged school administrators or teachers could use a special Zoom feature that allowed them to hear students even when their computer microphones appeared to be turned off or muted.:Over the course of months, TikTok user @shokshooter posted a series of videos perpetuating the conspiracy theory, including footage that he framed as interactions between him and teachers on the video chatting service with his account's ""mute"" feature turned on. By enabling the mute setting, Zoom users are supposed to be able to block all in-person audio or background noise from interrupting the virtual get-together.:The TikTok user, whose identity remained unknown, posted a video on Feb. 10 that alleged he had the below-displayed Zoom conversation with someone he claimed to be his teacher while his microphone was supposedly turned off.Alleged teacher: Are you still here?@shokshooter: Yeah.Alleged teacher: Did you need something?@shokshooter: You know I'm muted obviously, right?Alleged teacher: I can't discuss that. @shokshooter: OK, well you do. Can you tell me how that works, because it kind of seems fishy?Alleged teacher: I have another class I need to get to. We can discuss this another time.The TikTok user framed his videos as evidence of some kind of program or feature that allows authority figures such as teachers to secretly listen in on Zoom users whose computer screens showed a red line through a microphone symbol in the corner, supposedly meaning their microphones are ""muted."":The alleged teacher in the Feb. 10 video remained unknown.We reached out to @shokshooter's TikTok and Instagram accounts -- both of which display the moniker ""Mic Mute Man"" -- to discuss the allegations he made in the videos, but we have not received a response. We will update this report when or if we do.To investigate the underlying claim, however, we sought any evidence of a feature or application that allowed certain Zoom users to hear all meeting participants, regardless of their microphone or audio settings.A web page on Zoom's Help Center, an online hub to help users navigate the program, read:As the host or co-host in a meeting, you can manage your participants, including muting and unmuting participants to manage background noise and distractions. All participants can also mute or unmute themselves, unless the host has prevented them from unmuting.Due to privacy and security reasons, the host cannot unmute other participants without their consent. The host can either use the Ask All to Unmute option, which will prompt every user to unmute themselves, or can schedule the meeting with Request permission to unmute participants enabled, which will prompt the participants for pre-approval to be unmuted by the host.:In other words, the video chatting service gives hosts (the users who schedule the virtual meetings and invite others to join) the authority to determine how all other participants can use their microphones.The hosts can turn people's mics off -- muting them -- involuntarily, or they can choose options that allow participants to decide the audio setting for themselves throughout the meeting.So while the technology allows teachers, presumably hosts of Zoom classes, to mute students, the web service's guidelines explicitly state that such users cannot unmute participants without their approval first, due to laws governing communication privacy.Let us note here: At the start of, or throughout, meetings, hosts can turn people's mute setting off -- allowing their voice or background noise to be heard -- only if the participant previously granted consent for that action. See the below-displayed example of that question to Zoom users, which Snopes obtained via its Help Center.:In the viral TikTok videos, however, the narrator not only alleged the presumed hosts of his Zoom meetings unmuted him against his will, but also that his view of the video chatting service showed his microphone turned off.We reached out to Zoom to ask if it offered any features or programs to which users could subscribe that enabled them to hear meeting participants whose screens showed them muted. Matt Nagel, a spokesperson for the company, responded to our question via email::The answer is no, and it's unfortunate that people appear to be fabricating video footage and spreading misinformation to the contrary. Zoom takes security and privacy very seriously. We do not offer the ability, or a separate plan, other software, or any other means to secretly unmute and listen to others.In sum, while the exact motivation or circumstances of @shokshooter's videos remained unknown -- they could have been prerecorded Zoom meetings that he framed as live interactions with teachers, or he may have used mute-unmute keyboard shortcuts and video editing to make his claim -- their allegations were not true.

668,668,350.ExpertWhiteNationali,"This article is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.Authored by Sophie Bjork-James, Vanderbilt UniversityWhite nationalists keep showing up in the hearings of the U.S. House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.Evidence is mounting that white nationalist groups who want to establish an all-white state played a significant role in the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol that left five dead and dozens wounded.Thus far, the hearings ""have documented how the Proud Boys helped lead the insurrectionist mob into the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C,"" journalist James Risen wrote in the Intercept.:Based on July 12, 2022, testimony from a former Oath Keepers member, the white nationalist group coordinated with the Three Percenters, another group of white nationalists, and the Proud Boys in mobilizing their extremists groups to rally in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, as asked by President Trump in his Dec. 16, 2020, tweet.As a cultural anthropologist who has studied these movements for over a decade, I know that membership in these organizations is not limited to the attempted violent overthrow of the government and poses an ongoing threat as seen in massacres carried out by young men radicalized by this movement.In 2020, for instance, the Department of Homeland Security described domestic violent extremists as ""presenting the most persistent and lethal threat"" to the people of the United States and the nation's government.In March 2021, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified to Congress that the number of arrests of white supremacists and other racially motivated extremists has almost tripled since he took office in 2017.:""Jan. 6 was not an isolated event,"" Wray testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""The problem of domestic terrorism has been metastasizing across the country for a long time now, and it's not going away anytime soon.""The Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit civil rights group, tracked 733 active hate groups across the United States in 2021.Based on my research, the internet and social media have made the problem of white supremacist hate far worse and more visible; it's both more accessible and, ultimately, more violent, as seen on Jan. 6 at the U.S. Capitol and the shooting deaths of ten Black people at a Buffalo grocery story, among other examples.An Expansive, Online NetworkIn the 1990s, former KKK leaders including David Duke rebranded white supremacy for the digital age.:They switched KKK robes for business suits and connected neo-Nazi antisemitic conspiracies with broader anti-Black, anti-immigrant and anti-Islamic racism.From the 1990s to the late 2000s, this movement largely built discreet online communities and websites peddling racist disinformation.In fact, for years one of the first websites about Martin Luther King Jr. that a Google search recommended was a website created by white nationalists that spread neo-Nazi propaganda.In 2005, the white nationalist website Stormfront.org had 30,000 members - which might sound like a lot. But as social media expanded, with both Facebook and Twitter opening to anyone with an email address in 2006, its views got a lot more attention. By 2015, 250,000 people had subscribed to become members of Stormfront.org.Between 2012 and 2016, white nationalists on Twitter saw a 600% increase in Twitter followers. They have since worked to bring white supremacism into everyday politics.:The Tech Transparency Project, a nonprofit tech industry watchdog group, found that in 2020 half of the white nationalist groups tracked by the Southern Poverty Law Center had a presence on Facebook.Without clear regulations preventing extremist content, digitalcompanies, in my view, allowed for the spread of white nationalist conspiracies.Racist activists used algorithms as virtual bullhorns to reach previously unimaginable-sized audiences.Enter the 'Alt-Right'White nationalist leaders, such as Richard Spencer, wanted an even bigger audience and influence.Spencer coined the term ""alt-right"" to this end, with the goal of blurring the relationship between white nationalism and white conservatism. He did this by establishing nonprofit think tanks like the National Policy Institute that provided an academic veneer for him and other white supremacists to spread their views on white supremacy.:This strategy worked.Today, many white nationalist ideas once relegated to society's fringes are embraced by the broader conservative movement.Take, for instance, the Great Replacement Theory. The conspiracy theory misinterprets demographic change as an active attempt to replace white Americans with people of color.This baseless idea observes that Black and Latino people are becoming larger percentages of the U.S. population, and paints that data as the result of an allegedly active attempt by unnamed multiculturalists to drive white Americans out of power in an increasingly diverse nation.A recent poll showed that over 50% of Republicans now believe in this conspiracy theory.:Pro-Trump protesters and police clash on Jan. 6, 2021, at the U.S. Capitol.Lev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty ImagesIn 2016, during Trump's presidential campaign, Vice Magazine co-founder Gavin McInnes formed the Proud Boys to further the goals of the alt-right by protecting white identity with the use of violence if necessary.Proud Boys members are affiliated with white nationalist ideas and leaders, but they deny any explicit racism. Instead, they describe themselves as ""Western chauvinists"" who believe in the supremacy of European culture but also welcome members of any race who support this idea.Along with pro-gun militias such as the Oath Keepers and Three Percenters, the Proud Boys are an experiment in spreading white nationalist ideas to an online universe of potentially millions of social media users.Why Do People Join These Groups?:Data from manifestos posted online by white nationalist groups shows that many mass shooters share a few common characteristics - they are young, white, male and they spend significant time online at the same websites.The alleged shooter in the killing of 10 Black people in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Buffalo on May 14, 2022, described his reason as wanting to stop what he feared as the elimination ""of the white race.""His fears that people of color were ""replacing"" white people came from 4chan, a social media company popular among the alt-right.In 2019, nine African American church members were murdered in Charleston by a young white man who became radicalized through Google searches that led him to openly white supremacist content.Massacres in a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, and at a synagogue in Poway, California, all took place after the shooters began spending time on 8chan, an imageboard popular with white supremacists and the home of QAnon posts.:For many of these individuals, the most important part of their radicalization was not about their home life or personality quirks, but instead about where they spent time online.A Racially Diverse Democracy at StakeThe reasons men join groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers - and even some liberal groups - is less clear.A former Proud Boy member offered one reason: ""They want to join a gang,"" Russell Schultz told CNN on Nov. 25, 2020. ""So they can go fight antifa and hurt people that they don't like, and feel justified in doing it.""Antifa is a loose-knit group of usually nonviolent activists who oppose fascism.Other former extremist group members describe seeking camaraderie and friendship, but also finding racism and antisemitism.:  Former Oath Keeper Jason Van Tatenhove testifies on July 12, 2022, during a hearing by the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol.Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesBut more than any other issue, racial demographic changes are providing recruitment opportunities for white nationalists, many of whom believe that by the year 2045 white people will become the minority in the United States.In July 2021, the most recent date for which statistics are available, the U.S. Census Bureau notes that of the estimated population of 330 million American citizens, 75.8% are white, 18.9% are Hispanic, 13.6% are Black and 6% are Asian.What is also becoming clearer is that the spread of white nationalism endangers the idea of a democratic nation where racial diversity is considered a strength, not a weakness.:Sophie Bjork-James, Assistant Professor of the Practice in Anthropology, Vanderbilt UniversityThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

669,669,86.MelGibsonDidntSayHol,"Claim:Actor Mel Gibson said ""Hollywood is an institutionalized pedophile ring.""Rating:FalseAbout this rating Fact CheckIn April 2022, an old fake quote ostensibly uttered by actor Mel Gibson about how ""Hollywood is an institutionalized pedophile ring"" was recirculated on social media:::This is not a genuine quote from Gibson. The idea that Hollywood elites are engaged in a mass pedophile ring is one that has been pushed by conspiracy theorists for years. This claims, which are baked into the Qanon conspiracy theory, have falsely accused everyone from Tom Hanks to Oprah Winfrey of being involved in child sex trafficking. We looked into the origins of these rumors back in 2018, writing: The current crop [of pedophile ring rumors], at least, took root with what became known as ""Pizzagate."" Promoters of that conspiracy theory in 2016 used social media platforms to make unfounded but viral allegations that Hillary Clinton and other prominent Democrats were running a pedophile ring out of the basement of a Washington, D.C., pizzeria -- even though that restaurant had no basement.Since then, the dark theme of Pizzagate has found new life with permutations forming part of the Qanon conspiracy theory, incorporated under the umbrella term ""pedogate."" The gist of the pedogate conspiracy theory is that global elites -- politicians, celebrities, and wealthy businesspersons -- are covertly involved in a far-reaching ring that trafficks young children for sexual purposes.:While these rumors often come in the form of accusations, we've also seen several ""confessions"" similar to the fake Gibson post above, in which Hollywood stars supposedly admit to having knowledge of these crimes. A quote from actor Brad Pitt about ""elite Hollywood pedophiles control[ing] America"" originated with a network of hoax websites, as did similar fake quotes from Justin Bieber and Katy Perry. These hoax websites were also responsible for spreading the fake Gibson quote above. On Nov. 30, 2017, Newspunch.com, a website notorious for spreading sensational and entirely fabricated stories, published a story claiming that Gibson made these remarks on ""The Graham Norton Show."" While Gibson has appeared on Norton's show, he never made these remarks. A spokesperson for Gibson told Reuters that this quote was ""100% fake."" Fact-checkers at AFP, Check Your Fact, and Lead Stories all came to the same conclusion.  This is not a genuine quote from Gibson.  "
670,670,629.DidaVeteranGroupDisc,"Claim:A veteran group patrolling in Tucson, Arizona, found a child trafficking site.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In late May and early June, conspiratorial web sites such as TheFreeThoughtProject.com reported that a veteran group had stumbled upon a ""disturbing bunker"" in Tucson, Arizona, that was being used for child sex trafficking:When the veteran group reached the site, what they found was truly disturbing. Around the site, the group found trees equipped with restraints. They also found a stroller, a crib, hair dye, and pornographic material.""The solar lights are what gave it away,"" said Lewis Arthur. ""If we hadn't been walking on the right trail we would have never seen it, we would have walked right past it.""Upon further exploration of the site, the veterans found an underground bunker which they say was used to keep children from escaping. Inside the bunker, they found a dresser and two crates. The area was only big enough for children to fit inside.:According to the Tucson Police Department, the group stumbled onto private property on 31 May 2018 off Interstate 19 and West Valencia Road in Tucson. But what they found is nothing more than an abandoned homeless encampment. In a statement on the incident posted to their public Facebook page, Tucson police reported:Several individuals from a group of affiliated homeless veterans discovered the site and expressed concerns about possible criminal activity at that location. Tucson Police Department officers, detectives, and command staff conducted a thorough inspection of the site, spoke to the reporting parties, and collected evidence. Based on the department's investigation to this point, there is no indication this camp is being used for any type of criminal activity, including human trafficking. Yesterday, an unsubstantiated assertion was made that a body might be buried at the site. A cadaver dog was used to check the area with negative results.Tucson Police Sgt. Pete Dugan told us the department patrols many areas that have washes and deserts, and that law enforcement officers there are no strangers to homeless encampments. He also said the department has had officers, detectives, and command staff at the site investigating since the initial reports, along with human trafficking experts, and that no evidence of human trafficking has been found::Lots of times people in homeless camps will use tether straps or cloth, anything to help hang clothing, food or even trash to keep it off the ground and away from animals. You will see myriad types of things that they collect and use. There was a crib there that had a bunch of stuff in it along with all kinds of different things. But there was no evidence of any human trafficking or any criminal activity in that area.Immigration authorities confirmed their findings were in concurrence with those of Tucson police. In a statement, ICE told us:Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security special agents who specialize in human smuggling and human trafficking collaborated with the Tucson Police Department on the information collected from the scene. Based on the information provided by TPD, ICE/HSI concurred with the police department's findings that nothing at the site validates the claims of possible human trafficking or child sex trafficking.Despite the fact no credible evidence has surfaced indicating the site was anything more than a shelter used by the local homeless population, conspiracy theorists have latched on to the suggestion of pedophilia, as they so often do. In late 2016, outlandish rumors circulated that Hillary Clinton was running a pedophilia ring out of a Washington D.C. pizza parlor. Since then, a veritable cottage industry of disreputable web sites have regularly hawked clickbait stories about ""elite"" pedophile rings.:For those sold on the far-fetched idea that a local police department would provide cover for a vague ring of child predators, the findings of investigators have fallen on deaf ears. Conspiracy theories about a ""sex cult"" rocketed across the Internet. The disreputable blog BigLeaguePolitics.com, for example, employed the headline, ""Rothschilds and NXIVM Sex Cult Tied to Alleged Sex-Trafficking Land in Tuscon.""Big League Politics further reported (without any supporting evidence whatsoever) that the cover-up goes back more than a decade and has to do with the Clintons and Nxivm, a self-help organization whose founders in April 2018 were indicted by the United States Department of Justice on sex trafficking charges. The blog also reported that the mayor of Tucson's surname is Rothschild, ""but it is unconfirmed whether he is related to the dynastic family"" so often linked to anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. (It did not take us long to confirm that he is not).Conspiracy theories often circle back to the idea that a secretive global cabal (run by the Rothschilds or George Soros, depending on which wealthy Jewish person's name is most convenient) is waiting in the wings to seize power. In these narratives the cabal creates ""false flag"" mass casualty incidents as pretext to take all America's guns away -- or, alternatively, these same people (who must be remarkably busy) prey on children.:Even though Tucson police released their findings casting serious doubt on the veracity of child trafficking claims on 4 June 2018, social media users continued to troll their Facebook page (""How much are the Rothchilds paying these days,"" one person asked.) Men from the veteran group were still apparently visiting the site, as evidenced by videos they were making and posting to the platform YouTube.Craig Sawyer, founder of the organization Veterans for Child Rescue, for example, went into detail about his explorations of the site and finding what he believed to be a ""rape tree"":There's just a lot of creepy evidence and information on the way that's set up that gave us the very specific indication that that was probably used as a rape tree. And there was a little tug line with rubber strap handles tied to it for pulling on."
671,671,240.DidVinceFosterShootH,"Claim:Clinton associate Vince Foster shot himself three times in the back of the head to avoid testifying against Hillary Clinton.Rating:FalseAbout this rating No matter how many times conspiracy theories are disproved, they never die.Witness the return of a decades-old canard holding that Vince Foster, a longtime friend and associate of Bill and Hillary Clinton, did not commit suicide in 1993 (contrary to the findings of multiple investigations), but instead was murdered by the Clintons ""because he knew too much."":Since the mid-1990s, Foster's name has held a place of prominence on the viral list of ""Clinton Body Bags,"" a constantly growing roster of Clinton contacts who supposedly died under ""mysterious circumstances."" Like the theory that Foster didn't really kill himself, the rest of the ""Body Bags"" list has been discredited time and time again.The Vince Foster theory persists because it has a partisan fan base. While campaigning for the presidency, Donald Trump lent it credence during a 2016 interview in which he called the circumstances of Foster's death ""very fishy,"" the Washington Post reported:""He had intimate knowledge of what was going on,"" Trump said, speaking of Foster's relationship with the Clintons at the time. ""He knew everything that was going on, and then all of a sudden he committed suicide.""He added, ""I don't bring [Foster's death] up because I don't know enough to really discuss it. I will say there are people who continue to bring it up because they think it was absolutely a murder. I don't do that because I don't think it's fair."":The rumor cropped up in September 2018 in the form of a meme shared by two hyperpartisan Facebook pages, Uncle Sam's Misguided Children and Cold Dead Hands::The timing was curious. ""On this date in 1993,"" the meme says, ""Vince Foster went to Fort Marcy Park and shot himself 3 times in the back of the head to avoid testifying against Hillary Clinton."" But Foster committed suicide in July of that year, not September. After some searching, we found that the meme had been previously posted on 20 July 2018, when that part of the claim, at least, would have been accurate.The decision to re-share it in September 2018 (assuming there was any thought behind it at all) may have had to do with the fact that the Senate confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had just run into a roadblock in the form of an accusation of sexual assault by a woman who said Kavanaugh groped her at a party in the 1980s. The most likely explanation for bringing up Foster would seem to be that it was meant to divert attention from a Trump-related scandal to a Clinton-related scandal, but there's a complication: Kavanaugh led the investigation of Vince Foster's death by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr in the mid-1990s, an investigation that confirmed (ironically, in this context) Foster's death was indeed a suicide.:Kavanaugh has been condemned, on the one hand, for reopening an investigation that had already been concluded by a previous independent counsel, Robert Fiske, and ""tormenting"" Foster's family (in the words of liberal pundit Paul Begala) on the basis of rumors that the Clintons were somehow involved in his death. But Kavanaugh's involvement has also given rise to a strange new addendum to the conspiracy theory in far-right circles, namely that in exonerating the Clintons he helped cover up wrongdoing on their part.Right-wing pundit Andrew Napolitano gave voice to this accusation during a Fox News Channel appearance:You remember Vince Foster who killed himself in the White House? How did his body get from the White House to Fort Marcy Park? Who was the prosecutor in charge of figuring out how his body got there? Who was the prosecutor that exonerated Hillary and the thugs that moved his body? A young Brett Kavanaugh.Whatever the motivation behind its re-sharing, the meme got almost everything wrong. What's true is that Foster killed himself in 1993 (although it was in July, not September), and that he did so in Fort Marcy Park in Virginia (not, contrary to Napolitano's claim, in the White House).:But the sarcastic claim that he ""shot himself three times in the back of the head"" (implying that it wasn't really a suicide) is a fabrication. Every investigation to date has found that he shot himself once, in the mouth, with his own handgun. The implication that his death was connected to an expectation of his giving testimony against the Clintons is equally false. Foster, who was a White House deputy counsel at the time, was distraught over accusations of malfeasance involving the White House Travel Office, and he had sought treatment for depression prior to his suicide. Foster consistently maintained that the Travel Office scandal was baseless.As the Washington Post's Glenn Kessler wrote:Yes, there is a fringe minority of people who will believe in just about every conspiracy theory. There are hacks who believe that Foster died in the White House and that his body was moved. There was even a member of Congress who fired bullets into a cantaloupe (or was it a watermelon?) in an effort to prove that Foster was killed.But there were also five official investigations into Foster's death, conducted by professional investigators, forensic experts, psychologists, doctors and independent prosecutors with unlimited resources.Yes, the bullet was never found. (Foster died in a wooded park.) Yes, the Clinton White House was sometimes slow to release information or took steps that at times raised suspicions, such as removing from Foster's office files concerning an Arkansas real estate deal. But that was all examined, dissected, discussed, investigated two decades ago -- and found to be not material. The fifth probe lasted three years -- and still found nothing.:"
672,672,535.DidaDominionVotingSy,"Claim:Eric Coomer, director of product strategy and security for Dominion Voting Systems, bragged about rigging the 2020 election against Donald Trump in an antifa conference call.Rating:UnprovenAbout this rating Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.In the aftermath of the 2020 U.S. presidential election, outgoing President Donald Trump, along with many of his allies and supporters, promoted a slew of unfounded conspiracy theories and allegations that electoral fraud played a telling role in the victory of Democratic nominee Joe Biden.:In particular, election denialists focused on Dominion Voting Systems, a company that sells electronic voting machines and software in North America. We have previously addressed several of those claims in detail. In mid-November, Snopes readers asked us to look into one widely shared set of claims surrounding Eric Coomer, who is Dominion's director of product strategy and security. On Nov. 13, the right-wing commentator Michelle Malkin interviewed Colorado businessman and right-wing activist Joe Oltmann, who made a number of allegations against Coomer.Oltmann claimed he had infiltrated local antifa groups in Colorado, and in September 2020 took part in a telephone conference call. He said during that conversation, he heard a man named Eric speak, and another caller referred to him as ""Eric, the Dominion guy."" According to Oltmann, another participant in the call asked ""What are we going to do if fucking Trump wins,"" to which, according to Oltmann, ""Eric"" replied ""Don't worry about the election. Trump is not going to win, I made fucking sure of that. Hahaha."":Oltmann also posted what he presented as screenshots from Coomer's Facebook profile, which he broadly characterized as evidence that Coomer is an antifa adherent or activist who, given his position within Dominion, bragged about taking improper actions to alter the results of the 2020 presidential election, in a phone call with other antifa activists. Oltmann's allegations formed the basis of articles published by the notoriously unreliable conspiracy theory website the Gateway Pundit, who also interviewed Oltmann on Nov. 16, and the junk news site Neon Nettle. In a Fox Business interview on Nov. 15, Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani alluded to Oltmann's allegations against Coomer, saying ""One of the people there [at Dominion] is a big supporter of antifa and has written horrible things about the president for the last three or four years.""On Twitter, the president's sons and campaign surrogates Eric and Donald Trump Jr. also promoted Oltmann's allegations. The Gateway Pundit and Neon Nettle additionally claimed, in their articles, that Coomer's profile had recently been deleted from Dominion's website, in response to Oltmann's allegations. :In a news conference by the Trump campaign's legal team on Nov. 19, attorney Sidney Powell raised Oltmann's allegations, inaccurately describing Coomer as an executive at Smartmatic, an entirely separate elections technology company which has itself been the subject of various conspiracy theories that Snopes has previously addressed.Snopes found an ""Eric Coomer"" Facebook account whose profile picture matched the one Oltmann identified as being owned by the same Eric Coomer who has worked for Dominion, and from which he posted several screenshots. We have not yet been able to independently confirm that that Facebook profile belongs to Dominion's director of product strategy and security, and the profile does not feature the posts attributed to it by Oltmann. (Oltmann claims Coomer deleted those posts after Oltmann shared them, but we have not yet been able to verify this, either).Nonetheless, we contacted the person behind the Facebook account and invited them to clarify whether they are indeed the same Eric Coomer who worked at Dominion, and to respond to Oltmann's allegations. We did not receive a reply. After this fact check was published, Coomer sued Oltmann and others for their role in making and promoting the allegations against him. In Denver District Court filings, Coomer strenously denied those allegations.:For its part, Dominion told Snopes ""Where members of our company have been subject to threats and harassment, we have reported these issues to law enforcement.  We have also worked to report threats and disinformation being spread online. However, we will not discuss any current or former employees given privacy and safety concerns.""The company explicitly refuted the claim that his profile had recently been removed from Dominion's website in response to Oltmann's allegations. Closer examination shows that screenshots used to make this claim by Gateway Pundit and Neon Nettle actually originated on Lead Candy, a sales and marketing website. Twitter permanently suspended Oltmann's account (according to Oltmann, on Nov. 12), a move that itself gave rise to further claims of political bias, with Oltmann telling Malkin ""Twitter is antifa."" A spokesperson for Twitter told Snopes Oltmann's account was banned for ""violating the Twitter Rules, specifically our Civic Integrity Policy."" :That policy states that ""We prohibit attempts to use our services to manipulate or disrupt civic processes, including through the distribution of false or misleading information about the procedures or circumstances around participation in a civic process."" According to Twitter, permanent suspensions are reserved for ""severe or repeated violations"" of the civic integrity policy.On Dec. 22, 2020, after this fact check was first published, Coomer sued Oltmann, Malkin, Powell, Giuliani, the Trump campaign, the Gateway Pundit and others, alleging defamation, civil conspiracy, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. In his civil complaint, Coomer strenuously denied the allegations against him, writing:Dr. Coomer has no knowledge of an alleged ""Antifa Conference Call;"" Dr. Coomer did not participate in such an alleged call; Dr. Coomer did not make the comments Defendants falsely attribute to him; and Dr. Coomer did not take actions to subvert the presidential election as Defendants falsely allege.We don't know whether Oltmann's allegations against Coomer are accurate or not. However, the evidence Oltmann has so far made available does not demonstrate the accuracy of his claims. Furthermore, Coomer has strenuously denied those allegations, and sued Oltmann and others for defamation. If further substantive evidence becomes available, we will update this fact check accordingly.:Analysis""Trump is not going to win""Oltmann's primary allegation, that he heard Coomer bragging that he had interfered in the 2020 presidential election in order to ensure Trump's defeat, does not appear to be supported by evidence beyond Oltmann's own account. Snopes asked Oltmann whether he had an audio recording of the purported antifa conference call, or if he was joined on that call by another person who could corroborate his claims. Oltmann did not directly respond to those requests. That doesn't necessarily mean Oltmann's claim is false, it just means it is so far not supported by any publicly available evidence beyond his verbal account. On the Nov. 19 episode of the Conservative Daily podcast, Oltmann indicated he had filed a sworn affidavit reiterating his claims. Snopes requested a copy of that affidavit, as well as details of the court to which it was purportedly submitted, and the case to which it was purportedly attached. Oltmann did not respond to that request. :It's also not clear whether Coomer's alleged remarks, if they did take place, were made in earnest, and therefore whether they should be interpreted as proof of election meddling. Oltmann told Malkin he had heard Coomer laughing after allegedly bragging about interfering in the election (""Trump is not going to win, I made fucking sure of that. Hahaha."")Furthermore, even if Coomer made the comment in earnest, he might have been lying, either to impress others on the call, to exaggerate his power and influence, or for some other reason. In his lawsuit against Oltmann and others, Coomer firmly denied having any knowledge of, or taking part in, any ""Antifa conference call.""FacebookIn mid-November, Oltmann published what appeared to be several screenshots from the Facebook account of an individual named Eric Coomer. We found an account whose profile picture matched that of the account apparently featured in the screenshots, but we have not yet been able to verify that it is owned by Eric Coomer from Dominion. :Snopes asked Oltmann for any and all relevant screenshots, archived links and URLs relating to what he presented as Coomer's past pronouncements on Facebook, and in particular any concrete evidence demonstrating that the Facebook account did indeed belong to Eric Coomer from Dominion.In response, Oltmann told Snopes he had ""over 200 pictures and screenshots,"" though he didn't specify whether they constituted the proof we had requested. Oltmann expressed reluctance about providing them to Snopes, and ultimately did not do so in time for publication. If we receive substantive additional evidence, we will update this article accordingly. Since we haven't yet been able to verify the authenticity of the screenshots, or confirm that they were actually posted by Eric Coomer from Dominion, we're not linking to them in this article. They included a post that contained a purported statement by ""Antifa,"" but no clear sign that the poster endorsed the statement; a vehemently anti-Trump post from July 2016; a post dismissive of Trump supporters in Texas; posts of YouTube videos for songs whose titles or lyrics expressed antipathy towards police; and a post that strongly criticized a controversial ""election integrity"" commission set up by Trump to investigate his own unfounded claims of widespread electoral fraud in the 2016 elections.:To reiterate, we don't know whether Eric Coomer from Dominion created the posts shown in the screenshots Oltmann published. However, even if he did, they would not constitute proof of any impropriety on his part, and certainly would not point towards any election interference on his part. They do indicate that whoever created them is strongly critical of Trump and some of his followers. It might be inadvisable for an employee of an election technology company to articulate those views on social media, but the posts are not, in and of themselves, proof of improper actions. "
673,673,282.DidHenryKissingerAdv,"Claim:Henry Kissinger spoke to a ""eugenics council"" on controlling populations through forcible vaccinations.Rating:FalseAbout this rating A meme from 2019 posited that Dr. Henry Kissinger, who served as U.S. National Security Advisor and Secretary of State during the Nixon and Ford administrations, delivered a speech to a World Health Organization (WHO) council on eugenics in 2009 at which he declared that the first step in controlling populations was to get them to accept mandatory vaccinations. Following that step, people would accept forcible organ donation, genetically modified children, and mandatory sterilization:::Once the herd accepts mandatory forcible vaccination, it's game over! They will accept anything -- forcible blood or organ donation -- for the ""greater good."" We can genetically modify children and sterilize them -- for the ""greater good."" Control sheep minds and you control the herd. Vaccine makers stand to make billions, and many of you in this room today are investors. It's a big win-win! We thin out the herd and the herd pays us for providing extermination services. Now, what's for lunch, huh?The over-the-top nature of this putative Kissinger statement (particularly its concluding sentence) should be a strong indicator it's merely a fabrication. We find it unlikely that an experienced public speaker like Kissinger would use redundant adjectives (""mandatory forcible vaccination""), refer to the populace as a ""herd,"" or finish an address with the words ""Now, what's for lunch, huh?"" In no respect does it read like an excerpt from an actual speech.More to the point, the passage comprises an incoherent jumble of outlandish claims that could only make sense to a conspiracy theorist, leaping from forcible vaccinations to genetically modifying and sterilizing children to ""providing extermination services"" and ""thin[ning] out the herd."" Our efforts to find any evidence at all that Henry Kissinger uttered these words, or that he took similar public positions on other occasions, were in vain.:A ""World Health Organization Council on Eugenics"" does not exist, nor has such a body ever existed. The word ""eugenics"" has a long and sordid history, primarily as the name of a now-discredited social theory and movement from the early 20th century advocating the improvement of society by ensuring that people deemed genetically ""superior"" reproduce at a higher rate than those identified as ""inferior."" On the rare occasions when eugenics is discussed in World Health Organization (WHO) documents, it's in a historical context emphasizing that the practice served as a basis for the genocidal policies of Nazi Germany.Kissinger is often portrayed as a kind of supervillain in the writings of conspiracy theorists, who have misquoted him before in the interests of identifying him with the alleged machinations of a secretive, elite cabal to rule the world. ""Depopulation should be the highest priority of foreign policy towards the third world,"" they've quoted him as saying. The statement meshes well with the ersatz sentiments attributed to Kissinger above. When pressed, however, nobody seems to be able to specify where or when he ever made any such pronouncements."
674,674,656.DoOreoCookiesHaveaHi,"Claim:Symbols embossed on the exterior surfaces of Oreo cookies link the product to the alleged conspiratorial activities of the Knights Templar and Freemasons.Rating:FalseAbout this rating We do not know who first paused to ponder the ornate design of an Oreo cookie before eating it, but the decorative embossed pattern is considered integral to the Oreo experience and has inspired praise from such highfalutin sources as American architectural critic Paul Goldberger, who enthused on the occasion of its 75th birthday that the cookie's form ""leaps across stylistic boundaries"" to epitomize modernism::The way in which the two chocolate wafers appear to float, held together only by a recessed inner layer of cream filling, seems to epitomize the modernist esthetic, while the richly decorated chocolate wafers are a celebration of the role of ornament. So, like a building that mixes sleek glass and gargoyles, this cookie does nothing less than transcend the gulf separating modernism and traditionalism.The ornamental pattern of the wafer itself, however, is the Oreo's visual signature. Stamped out by brass rollers passing over sheets of chocolate dough, the pattern consists of a series of four-leaf clovers around the word ''OREO,'' which is set within the traditional trademark of Nabisco, its manufacturer -- that trademark being a horizontal oval with what looks like a television antenna extending up from it. Around the clovers, a broken line forms a broken circle. Beyond that, the outer edge of the cookie is slightly ridged, serving both as a visual frame for the ornamental center and as a means of grasping the cookie with comparative ease.While the cookie-in-itself may not be difficult to grasp, some find that the meaning of its elaborate embossed design nonetheless remains elusive. There is no official explanation of what the ring of four-leaf flowers, the segmented line with intermittent dots encircling it, the television antenna-like structure atop the name ""OREO,"" or the 90 evenly-spaced pillars adorning its outer rim are supposed to stand for (if anything). And despite there being no good reason to assume the pattern is anything other than decorative, there are those for whom the Oreo cookie's design represents a deep, dark mystery to be plumbed. Do the symbols communicate a hidden message?:'Think it's just a coincidence?'An interesting theory summarized in a 2014 Reddit post links the ""symbology"" of the Oreo to the medieval Knights Templar and the fraternal order of Freemasonry, two organizations often implicated in grand-scale conspiracy theories:The symbol around the word Oreo on the center of the cookie was designed from the Knights Templar Cross of Lorraine, which is a symbol of quality. The ""flowers"" on the Oreo were rendered using the Knights Templar Cross Pattee. The dots, flowers and dashes represent the 3 degrees of Ancient Craft Freemasonry. The arranging of the dots around the cookie were strategically placed to form the 5 Pointed Star; the symbol of the Order of the Eastern Star. All of these symbols are still used throughout the Masonic bodies, including the Eastern Star, Knights Templar and the Scottish Rite.Think it's just a coincidence?The inventor, who rapidly climbed from the mail room to design executive and was responsible for today's look of the Oreo, was a Freemason.:There's a lot to unpack there, but we'll forego the factual claims for a moment to address the burning question on the lips of anyone unaccustomed to swimming in the murky waters of conspiracism: So what?If, in fact, the Oreo's designer was a Freemason, so what? If, in fact, there are esoteric symbols on the cookies, so what? If the presence of those symbols isn't coincidental, what are we supposed to make of that? What's the point of putting them on a cookie?To be frank, there are probably no rational answers to those questions, nor is it likely that all conspiracy theorists would offer up the same ones. These are folks who claim to find similar symbolism everywhere, including in classical art, popular media, religious texts, corporate logos, and on ordinary currency. They regard such symbols as emblems of a secretive, all-powerful organization -- call it Freemasonry, the Order of Solomon's Temple (aka the Knights Templar), the Illuminati, or the New World Order -- that has conspired behind the scenes to rule every nation on the planet, like puppet-masters, for centuries. Beyond absolute world domination, it's unclear what the secret society's underlying raison d'etre is supposed to be. Some say it's religious (a Jewish or Catholic conspiracy), others say it's occult or Satanic (e.g., a conspiracy to install the Antichrist), others say it's political (e.g., Communism), and still others promote the notion that an evil race of humanoid reptiles is behind it all.:So, why, if it's such a super-secret conspiracy, are graphic symbols of this organization to be found everywhere, including on cookies? The various reasons ventured by conspiracy theorists include the following:They're a means of covert communication between members of the Illuminati.They're a means of asserting ownership over everything and everyone (essentially a tool of ""branding"").They're a tool of psychic programming or mind control.They're a means of luring the unknowing masses into Satanic or occult worship.In the case of the cookies specifically, they're a means of tricking untold millions of people to participate in a holy or unholy communion against their will every time they ingest an Oreo.As you ponder the above, also consider this: Oreos are the largest-selling packaged cookie in the entire world, with $2.9 billion in sales annually in more than 100 different countries. Mondelez International, the parent company of Nabisco, which manufactures Oreos, reports that more than 40 billion of the cookies are baked and consumed every year. Whether it's for the purpose of mind control, covert communication, or mass Satanic conversion, their consumer reach is beyond compare. Indeed, if world domination is one's goal, it's hard to escape the conclusion that Oreos are, in fact, indispensable for that purpose.:Unless, of course, the ""symbolism"" with which they're embossed is, and always has been, nothing more than a decorative pattern. It's time to take a closer look.Docked and embossedThe practice of molding or stamping decorative imagery on cookies (or biscuits, as they are also called) is quite old. In its simplest form, a method called ""docking,"" the dough is perforated with small holes to prevent it from puffing during baking. At its most complex, the technique entails ""embossing"" the surfaces of baked goods with intricate designs for aesthetic or ceremonial purposes. Innovations brought about during the industrial revolution ensured a future in which cookies would be mass-produced by the billions:The turn of the 19th century saw the birth of the industrial biscuit, and, with it, the marriage of these two morphologies -- docking and decorating -- into an automated production line. In the late 1890s, two cousins, both called Thomas Vicars, designed the first embossing and cutting machine, capable of punching holes, stamping decorations, and cutting out up to 80 biscuits per minute from a moving sheet of dough. The dies were necessarily hand carved until engraving machines were introduced in the early 1900s. ... But the true golden age of biscuit engineering did not dawn until the invention of the rotary molder in the late 1920s.This technology, albeit updated with variable speed controls, advanced non-stick coatings, and quality sensors, is still used to make Oreos and most other thick embossed biscuits today. The cookie dough is forced into negative molds, which imprint patterns, brand names, and docker holes. A scraping knife (""D"" in the diagram above) scrapes off any excess dough to give a flat bottom, and the formed biscuits peel away onto a conveyor belt to be baked.:In 1908, one of the new industrial-scale baked goods companies created to profit from these rapidly improving production capabilities, Sunshine Biscuits, introduced a product called Hydrox, a creme-filled chocolate sandwich cookie with an embossed design on the top and bottom. It was a sensation, and four years later inspired Sunshine's biggest competitor, the National Biscuit Company (Nabisco), to launch a knock-off: the Oreo (many assume that the Oreo came first and Hydrox was a copycat, but the reverse was true).Oreo truthsThe first thing to know about the Oreo's design, then, is that it was modeled after that of another product, Hydrox, which also had an embossed pattern on its face.The second thing to know is that the design evolved over time. The pattern we're familiar with today was implemented in 1952, and is a more complex version of the two designs that came before. ""Interestingly, when the Oreo was first introduced by Nabisco in 1912,"" writes Nicola Twilley in The Atlantic, ""it used a much more organic wreath for its emboss, later augmented with two pairs of turtledoves in a 1924 redesign."":The third thing to know is that we've established the identity of the person who came up with the current design, a longtime Nabisco engineer named William A. Turnier, and although no one ever had a chance to interview him and inquire as to the meaning of the various elements in the pattern, his son has been quite forthcoming about his father's thinking. Remember the rumor quoted above about the Oreo's designer being a Freemason? Not so, says Bill Turnier of his father, who he claims scoffed when people asked serious questions about the design:""I read something on the Internet about some speculation about Masonic designs, et cetera,"" Bill Turnier told me. ""But my father was not a Mason. His father was, but he had no big enthusiasm for it. Some of this Masonic stuff, I can't imagine the people who get into that and the numerological significance.""Nonetheless, cookie enthusiasts and numerologists often called his father. ""Someone wanted to know the significance of there being 90 notches around the edge,"" Bill Turnier says. ""I think there's 90, and my dad's like, 'I don't know, is that how many there are? I bet I put my compass down and kicked every fourth degree.'""Bill Turnier recalls that his father also fielded complaints about the four-leafed flower. ""Somebody called him up when he was 65 and said there were no flowers with four petals on them. My dad couldn't care."" (There are, for the record, plenty of flowers, including the Western Wallflower and varieties of primroses, which bear four petals.):Turnier's ring of four-petaled flowers was a stylized update of the ""more organic"" floral patterns used on earlier versions of the cookie. Claiming the shape is actually a version of the ""Knights Templar Cross Pattee"" does not make it so. Nor does a similarity between the ""antenna"" shape over the name ""OREO"" and the traditional Cross of Lorraine (which has also been identified with the Knights Templar in historical imagery) force one to conclude that it had a conspiratorial origin. The oval and cross in the center of the pattern is actually a variant of the Nabisco logo, which, according to the web site of the Bernhardt Fudyma Design Group, has been in use since 1900:At the end of the 19th century, the newly formed National Biscuit Company took its first step toward the creation of what would become one of the world's most recognized logos. Adolphus Green, the baking giant's first chairman, took charge of developing an entirely new brand-name cracker to be sold in a package specially designed to preserve its crispness. A symbol for this product, and the company itself, was needed for use on the package and in advertising.Mr. Green found a simple design - an oval crowned by a double-barreled cross - while looking through his collection of rare books. During the 15th century this design was used as a pressmark by the society of Printers in Venice. Prior to that, in the early Christian era, the mark symbolized the triumph of the spiritual over the worldly.Framed in the octagonal shape of the new 'Uneeda Buiscuit' and filled with the word 'In-er Seal' (the name given to the unique wax-paper-lined package), it became the company's first official trademark in 1900. During the next five decades, the oval enclosed various combinations of the company's initials, the Uneeda brand name and, finally, the current acronym 'Nabisco'.:While the notion that the world's top-selling cookie is somehow a vehicle for powerful secret entities to exercise world domination makes for an exciting story, such evidence as there is suggests that, like so many other staples of modern life, the only real motive behind its invention was the desire to manufacture a good product and sell it at a profit. Sometimes (as Sigmund Freud ought to have said, but didn't), a cookie is just a cookie."
675,675,237.TrumpPromotesTweetFa,"U.S. President Donald Trump entered alarming new rhetorical territory in the battle for the White House on Sept. 15, 2020, promoting a tweet that labeled his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, a pedophile. The remarkable attack took place when Trump retweeted an earlier post by @ConservUSA38, which contained the hashtag #PedoBiden, along with a short video of Biden standing close to a woman, placing his hands on her shoulders, and leaning his face into the back of her head::In recent years, those images have been used by critics of Biden, and supporters of Trump, as purported proof that the former vice president has a history of inappropriately touching strangers -- especially women. The video was taken from the February 2015 swearing-in ceremony of Ash Carter as U.S. Secretary of Defense.The woman shown in the video with Biden is Stephanie Carter, wife of the incoming defense secretary. In 2019, she firmly rejected efforts to present that moment as evidence of impropriety on the part of Biden, whom she said was acting as ""a close friend helping someone get through a big day, for which I will always be grateful."" She wrote that:""By the time then-Vice President Biden had arrived [at the ceremony], he could sense I was uncharacteristically nervous and quickly gave me a hug. After the swearing in, as Ash was giving remarks, he leaned in to tell me, 'Thank you for letting him do this' and kept his hands on my shoulders as a means of offering his support."":No credible evidence exists that Biden has ever even been formally accused of any sexual impropriety with a child. As well containing a baseless smear, the tweet made little sense because the woman shown in the video was clearly an adult, and has herself publicly articulated her gratitude to Biden for what she unambiguously characterized as a welcome gesture of support from a close friend.None of that prevented Trump from promoting the tweet, and the account behind it, to his nearly 86 million followers. Several hours after Snopes first recorded the president's promotion of the post, it remained on his Twitter feed, and in that time, the tweet had garnered several thousand additional retweets and likes.The person behind @ConservUSA38, an account that currently bears the name Conservative Girl, has not made his/her name public, and it was not immediately possible to identify the person. The poster claims to be a woman living in New Hampshire, who has in the past lived in Salem, Massachusetts, and Florida, and a former preschool teacher who is currently a caregiver for their elderly parents. We have not yet been able to verify the authenticity of those biographical details. :In the past, @ConservUSA38 has used two separate profile photographs, both of which are different from the one currently used. Such activity can sometimes indicate that a Twitter account is inauthentic, but we have not yet found definitive proof of that in this instance.:A review of @ConservUSA38's Twitter feed shows that the person behind the account posts prolifically on current affairs and trending content, from a conservative point of view, consistently articulating support for Trump and opposition to Biden. The person has also targeted U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., falsely claiming that Omar did not have legal immigration status, and calling for her to be deported. Omar is a naturalized U.S. citizen.In recent days, the person behind @ConservUSA38 has repeatedly posted about the baseless smear that Biden is a pedophile, tweets given a potential audience of tens of millions after Trump promoted one of them. The president's son, Donald Trump Jr., amplified that false conspiracy theory in May 2020, when he posted on Instagram a meme that featured a photograph of Biden with the phrase ""See you later, alligator,"" along with a photograph of an alligator and the phrase ""In a while, pedophile.""Trump Jr. suggested the meme was meant in jest, but his remarks took an earnest turn when he wrote, ""That said, there's [sic] definitely way too many Creepy Joe videos out there!"" He replicated that shift in tone in a later tweet, in which he said he was ""joking around,"" but then added, ""If the media doesn't want people mocking & making jokes about how creepy Joe is, then maybe he should stop the unwanted touching & keep his hands to himself?"" thus adding fuel to the conspiracy theory about which he also claimed to be ""joking."":Unlike Biden, the president has in fact been formally accused of raping a child. In 2016, a woman referred to in California and New York court filings by the pseudonyms ""Jane Doe"" and ""Katie Johnson,"" filed lawsuits against Trump and the multi-millionaire investor and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, alleging that they both raped her in 1994, when she was 13 years old. Trump and his lawyers vigorously denied the allegations, and the woman dropped the lawsuit in November 2016, claiming that she had received death threats."

Several ""scientific"" claims have been made or manufactured to further bolster the notion that something nefarious is going on with COVID-19 and these labs, but this information comes from non-peer-reviewed papers misconstrued to be actual additions to the scientific record, or from disreputable websites such as Mercola.com. The actual scientific facts known about the novel coronavirus leave little room for it to be a virus of human creation, however.Regardless, the idea of a Soros connection to the COVID-19 pandemic stems from the fact that Wuhan, China, was the apparent origin point of the novel coronavirus, and WuXi AppTec, a Shanghai-based pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, and medical device company, operates a ""small molecule drug discovery and research services"" facility there. And according to the conspiracy theory, Soros ""owns WuXi AppTec."" QED.:However, Soros holds no executive position at WuXi AppTec, and a list of the company's major shareholders shows that none owns more than 10% of the shares, and all of the largest shareholders are Chinese entities with no discernible connection to Soros himself.A May 2011 quarterly report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shows that Soros Fund Management, a private American investment management firm, does (or did) have a holding in a related company (Wuxi PharmaTech (Cayman)). However, such institutional investment is common in the business world and does not make the head of any given investment firm the ""owner"" of all the businesses in which the firm holds a stake.When pulled, the thread of Soros to Soros Fund Management, to Wuxi PharmaTech (Cayman), to WuXi AppTec, to a biotech research facility in Wuhan, leads to nothing. All credible scientific evidence indicates the SARS-CoV-2 virus evolved or mutated and was not bioengineered, and the addition of Soros to any far-fetched conspiracy theory indicates nothing so much as a lack of imagination.:"
677,677,292.HillaryClintonUsedGr,"Claim:Hillary Clinton used a green screen to add fake audience members during her August 2016 speech in Nevada.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 25 August 2016, a video started circulating on YouTube along with the claim that Hillary Clinton had used a green screen to create a fake audience during her speech in Nevada::The ""proof,"" according to the narrator, can be seen on the screens of the cell phones being held up by audience members. The narrator claims that the images seen on audience member cell phones differ from the images seen on the television feed:As she's leaving, look at these two smartphones. The one at the top is shooting something else. The one at the bottom, it looks like they have a piece of baldie's head. But here's the top one. It looks like a white wall. There's no american flags. There's no red white or blue signs, There's no mob of people. It looks like an empty set. So the question is, was the floor audience inserted by a green screen? Was the floor audience reall there. Because the floor audience is holding up there phones and their not seeing any of this. :One reason the pictured phone cameras show different images than the television feed is that the television camera is filming from a different angle. While the narrator seems to acknowledge this as he shows different images from different phone cameras, he seems to forget this fact when factoring in the main feed. The stage Clinton spoke at in Nevada is slightly elevated, meaning that the floor audience members would be filming at a slightly tilted angle. This likely explains the ""white wall"" shown in the ""top"" phone pictured above::The video also claims that Clinton is not visible on many of the phone screens. While it is certainly difficult to discern objects on these phone screens, Clinton is clearly visible as she leaves the podium:Of course, unlike the creator of this video, we'd never hinge our argument on a blurry screenshot of a video feed containing a video feed on cell phone screen. Luckily, there's a much easier way to prove that Hillary Clinton did not use a green screen during her Nevada speech. :Here's a photograph of Clinton interacting with one of the ""fake"" audience members::Another photograph from behind the podium shows the floor audience:Here's a shot from the reverse angle (note the height of the television cameras and the large white wall in the background)::And for good measure, here's a photograph from the side of the stage::The conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton used a green screen during her August 2016 speech in Nevada is based entirely on a few blurry screenshots of audience phone screens. Photographs from the event, however, as well as the logical application of angles, show that Clinton's audience was indeed real.While it isn't particularly relevant to the argument offered above, it should be noted that the YouTube user who uploaded this video went by the handle ""Barry Soetoro,"" which some conspiracy theorists claim is President Obama's actual name.

Wolchesky argued (unsuccessfully) during his trial that ""pedophiles are a persecuted minority, and that the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice wrongfully makes this conduct a crime."":It is true that in January 2020 Wolchesky received a favorable ruling from an appellate panel. However, he didn't ""win"" an appeal of his conviction, and that ruling had nothing to do with the court's reconsidering the merits of Wolchesky's already rejected argument at trial that pedophiles are victims of discrimination, as the meme falsely suggests. Rather, the appeal was granted on narrow grounds related to Wolchesky's constitutional right to a speedy trial -- seven years elapsed between his 2009 arrest and the commencement of his trial in 2016, and a lower court was ordered to examine that issue:The legal victory was not based on what the court called the defendant's ""unusual"" strategy of promoting pedophilia but on the constitutional right to a speedy trial.The now-31-year-old Gary Wolchesky was first arrested in 2009 but it took seven years before his trial started.In a 44-page decision released Jan. 28, a three-judge appellate panel said that part of this delay was the fault of Wolchesky, who insisted on representing himself. But part of the delay also was the result of the investigation and new charges that were later added on.:The appellate decision said that seven years was a ""substantial period of time, one that requires scrutiny."" The decision orders a lower court to examine in order determine whether any delays in the trial attributed to prosecutors were legitimate.The appellate decision dismissed Wolchesky's other points of appeal concerning the fairness of the trial and the sentencing, arguing that any errors in evidence, comments by prosecutors or jury instruction were ""minimal"" considering that he ""chose to place his sexual predisposition with respect to young boys before the jury as the foundation of his defense strategy.""""The child victims in this case presented compelling evidence of the harm defendant inflicted by befriending them, confusing them and ultimately inducing them to engage in perverse sexual acts,"" the decision says.In short, no legal ""precedents"" related to pedophilia are being set by this case, for ""Hollywood"" or anyone else -- just the continued application of the Sixth Amendment's guarantee that ""the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial."":"

His latest theory takes the cake. In a post on social media dumpster fire Parler, Lindell produced a new spin on the real reason behind the Capitol attack.  ""The rioters were hypnotized by antifa temptresses who hid psychoactive drugs in their vaginas,"" said Lindell. ""If you look at the video, many of the rioters had crazed looks in their eyes."" This item was not a factual recounting of real-life events. The article originated from a website that describes its output as being humorous or satirical in nature, as follows:""The Business Standard News is a satirical site designed to parody the 24-hour news cycle.""Many supporters of Trump, and adherents to baseless conspiracy theories that President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory was either illegitimate or the result of widespread fraud, have sought to distance themselves from the chaos and violence that took place at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, by claiming the events of that day were orchestrated by left-wing agents provocateurs, in particular, antifa.:Snopes has debunked several strands of that theory. However, the ""antifa temptresses"" quotation, attributed to Lindell, was fabricated.Although the Business Standard News carries a ""satire"" disclaimer on its website, it does not appear on every article.

While many of these iterations are only about two minutes long, some longer edits of this hoax video (such as the clip above from Rumble) have also spread online. :This video does not show NASA astronauts pretending to be on the moon while filming a fake moon landing in the Nevada desert. The majority of the clips in this video were actually taken from a behind-the-scenes look at the 1970s movie ""Capricorn One."" For example, one of the opening clips in this hoax video (at roughly 20 seconds when a person looks at a camera) can be seen around the 2:00 minute mark of the following video from the making of this satirical film. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2J90A4PKo Another way to tell that this rumor is false is by checking Wikileaks. While this organization has published classified materials in the past, it has not released any footage indicating that the moon landing was fake. We were unable to find this ""fake moon landing"" video on Wikileaks' website or social media feeds. Conspiracy theories concerning the moon landing have been circulating practically since Apollo 11 touched down on the surface of the moon in July 1969. But it wasn't until the release of ""Capricorn One"" in 1978, according to astronomer Phil Plait, that this conspiracy theory moved into the mainstream. :Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin stepped onto the lunar surface on July 20, 1969. Even back then, some people were skeptical that the feat was technologically possible. The James Bond movie ""Diamonds Are Forever,"" for example, had a joke about faked moon landings just two years later, in 1971.But what really propelled the conspiracy theory into popular culture, Plait said, was the 1978 Peter Hyams film ""Capricorn One,"" which portrays a faked human landing on Mars. (Also, a 1976 self-published pamphlet by Bill Kaysing, ""We Never Went to the Moon,"" was popular among conspiracy-minded people of the day.)That was 40 years ago, but moon-hoax enthusiasts are still with us today.Here's a trailer for the satirical film:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKbwdTCL8rA We've looked into several of these rumors in the past and found that many of them are based on various pieces of media being removed from their original context and then shared with false claims. This photograph, for example, truly shows three people wearing astronaut suits but no helmets. While this photograph was shared on social media as if it was ""proof"" that the moon landing was filmed on a movie stage, not the moon, the picture was actually taken during an earth-bound training mission three years after the 1969 moon landing.

Some stated that they believed they were attacked with anthrax.:We found no evidence, however, that any such attack occurred.The event, ""ReAwaken America,"" took place at Elevate Life Church over the Dec. 10-11 weekend. According to the Dallas Morning News, it was organized by the consulting company ThriveTime Show.It featured speakers like former U.S. President Donald Trump's son Eric Trump, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, Infowars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, and Sidney Powell, an attorney who spread false, fantastical claims of widespread election fraud amid the 2020 election cycle.A little over a week after the ReAwaken event, various conspiracy theorists, including Qanon ""influencer"" Ron Watkins, began repeating a claim that some who were there were ""very sick with what is suspected to be anthrax poisoning."" The rumor got picked up by some right-wing websites.A bioterrorism attack on U.S. soil would no doubt spark a massive emergency response and result in investigations at multiple levels of government. However, when we reached out to local police asking if they knew of any such an incident occurring during the ReAwaken America event, we were told that nothing of the kind had been reported.:A spokesman for Frisco police told Snopes in an email that there have been ""no reports"" of anthrax or any biological agent deployed against the event.Anthrax, the disease caused by Bacillus anthracis bacteria spores, is one of the most feared and potentially deadly agents used in bioterrorism attacks. Untreated anthrax from inhalation of spores has an extremely high mortality rate.The most significant anthrax attack in the U.S., which took place shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, killed five people and sickened 17. In that case, anthrax was delivered to people through the mail in letters laced with the spores."
683,683,33.How911HeraldedDecade,"The events of Sept. 11, 2001, had a profound effect on almost every aspect of modern life, in the United States, and far beyond. The attacks themselves killed thousands, of course, and led to wars that cost hundreds of thousands of lives and trillions of dollars in spending. The U.S. government-led response brought far-reaching changes to national security, immigration, air travel, policing, and privacy, and for many millions of Muslims in the United States and other Western countries, life changed overnight.That day also had a bearing on another important feature of 21st century society -- the internet, and how information, good and bad, travels through it.Back in 2001, just over half of Americans, and only 14% of those aged over 65, used the internet, and Facebook, Twitter and YouTube were all three to five years away from coming into existence.However, Snopes.com had already been up and running for seven years, mostly addressing claims about Coca-Cola, Disney, and Hollywood, and debunking stray pseudoscience, with the occasional foray into political misinformation.  After Sep. 11, 2001, that changed.:To read through the archives of this website, before and after 9/11, is to observe the evolution of misinformation on the modern internet -- from decades-old urban legends, shared at slow pace on chain emails, through to deadly serious 9/11 conspiracy theories posted on early internet chat rooms, right up to the present day, where hundreds of millions of social media users share multimedia misinformation, almost all of it political and hyper-partisan, or racially or culturally inflammatory, at lightning speed, and to a potentially global audience, largely from handheld mobile phones. The Search for Answers After 9/11 U.S. government workers mill around near the White House and the Old Executive Office building 11 September, 2001, in Washington, DC. (Photo by -/AFP via Getty Images):Within hours of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and the heroic actions of passengers on United Airlines Flight 93, some shocked and fearful Americans, searching desperately for meaning in the events of that day, began emailing each other bogus claims that the 16th-century French astrologist Nostradamus had predicted it all. By the next morning, Snopes had debunked those claims, and from there, the site was inundated.In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, Co-Founder David Mikkelson had to shut down the Snopes message board during daylight hours in order to prevent the server -- which was shared with the main website -- from crashing. Eventually, he was forced to set up a second server to deal with an unprecedented volume of site visitors and reader inquiries.Whereas before, readers submitted their questions with a sense of curiosity and even leisurely inquiry, 9/11 instantly raised the stakes. Now, with millions of Americans gripped by profound and visceral fear and uncertainty -- who exactly was responsible for the attacks? was a second wave imminent? -- Snopes readers sought to regain a sense of control and understanding, submitting questions about a boycott of Osama Bin Laden's purported business interests, and then, the 9/11 conspiracy theories, which first emerged within hours of the attacks, and persist two decades later.:Snopes addressed those questions in real time, in the days, weeks, months and years after the attacks. Some strayed into the realms of mysticism and numerology, such as the bogus Nostradamus ""predictions,"" and the widely shared wingdings canard. Others were blatantly anti-semitic and anti-Israeli.The most persistent and impactful, though, revolved around the mechanics of the attacks themselves, with false claims that a cruise missile, deployed by shadowy government insiders, had damaged the Pentagon, and that the Twin Towers had been brought down by a controlled explosion. Claims about ""false flag"" operations predated 9/11 and the advent of the internet, as did suspicion of official U.S. government explanations of intriguing rumors and mysteries. And anti-semitic conspiracy theories are arguably the oldest, most persistent form of propaganda in existence. However, the expansion, popularity and reach of conspiracy theories and misinformation surrounding 9/11 are uniquely intertwined with the rapid growth and evolution of the internet itself, and in significant ways set the blueprint for the now predictable emergence of conspiracy theories and propaganda in the aftermath of major events in the intervening 20 years. :9/11 Conspiracy Theories and Growth of the Modern Internet Right-wing talk show host Alex Jones confronts Hispanic protesters in Austin, Texas on September 18, 2005. (Photo by Robert Daemmrich Photography Inc/Corbis via Getty Images)Advances in technology and the emergence of online social networks have fueled the ""9/11 truth movement"" in a way that simply would not have been possible had the attacks taken place a decade earlier.:Consider, for example, ""Loose Change""  -- a 2005 film made by three 20-something friends in upstate New York. With a reported budget of just a few thousand dollars, and using a personal laptop computer, the filmmakers were able to create an early internet sensation and promulgate false and misleading 9/11 conspiracy theories to an audience of millions.On Sept. 10, 2001, only 7 percent of American households were equipped with broadband internet. By 2006, that had increased to nearly half -- an explosive growth in the number of Americans who had internet speeds that would allow them to stream an 80-minute video such as ""Loose Change.""In October 2007, architect Richard Gage was presenting his 9/11 conspiracy theories in person at Pancho's Mexican restaurant in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. In 2009, his group -- Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth -- set up their Facebook page, and by September 2021, they had amassed half a million followers. In June 2006, conspiracy theorist and talk radio host Alex Jones organized a ""9/11 and the NeoCon Agenda"" convention in Los Angeles, telling a news conference that ""the evidence is overwhelming that 9/11 was an inside job."" The two-day convention had a healthy turnout -- an estimated 1,200 people. But those figures are dwarfed by the online following that Jones cultivated over the ensuing decade. :In 2017, Jones' Infowars website had around 10 million monthly visitors. By the time major tech companies de-platformed him in 2018, after he had spent years spreading inflammatory and defamatory conspiracy theories, Jones had amassed 2.5 million YouTube subscribers, more than 1.5 million followers on Facebook, and nearly a million on Twitter. The rise of Jones in the two decades after Sept. 11, 2001, illustrates another important feature of that period -- how 9/11 skepticism metastasized into other virulent strains of conspiracy theories, and how the growth of the internet played a key role in facilitating that expansion.'If You Like This ...' Supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump fly a U.S. flag with a symbol from the group QAnon as they gather outside the U.S. Capitol January 06, 2021 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images):Not all conspiracy theorists believe every conspiracy theory presented to them, but clearly, those theories have crossover appeal. After all, if you are willing to believe elements within the U.S. government conspired in secret to plan the deadliest ever terrorist attack on American soil, slaughtering thousands of their own citizens, despite libraries of evidence to the contrary, why shouldn't your mind also be open to the possibility that the same government is planning to use (or create) natural disasters or epidemics in order to imprison millions of Americans in internment camps? From there, it's not a giant leap to imagine that governments would covertly implant microchips in their own citizens, under the guise of a vaccine, and so on, and so forth.Back in the 2000s, listeners to Jones' radio show might have tuned in to hear him speak about 9/11, but they would also have been exposed to his claims about the New World Order. In the 2010s, suspicious viewers might have watched Infowars for Jones' rants about the Sandy Hook school shooting, which he claimed was a ""false flag"" operation designed to encourage stricter gun control laws. But they might well also have heard him and his guests assert, in earnest, that then-President Barack Obama was stockpiling half a million disposable coffins for some nefarious, genocidal purpose. :During the 2016 presidential election, anyone who watched Jones outline, in extraordinary detail, his claims that both Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton were literally demons from hell, could hardly have been surprised to encounter the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which held that leading Democrats were part of a shadowy pedophile ring operating out of a pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C.Jones, perhaps more than any other figure, illustrates the ways in which conspiracy theories feed into and overlap with one another, and have multiple points of entry. Technology companies and social media platforms have provided a powerful boost to that metastasis, in recent years, by using algorithms to suggest ""related"" content to readers and viewers -- encouraging unceasing consumption of linked conspiracy theories and falsehoods, thus sending millions of people ""down the rabbithole"" of online radicalization. His body of work also demonstrates how 9/11 conspiracy theories, which flourished in the early modern internet, set a blueprint for their successors: distrust of official accounts; assertions of harmful government intentions; and claims of staged or ""false flag"" atrocities.:The response to 9/11 has also been echoed in other ways -- claims that Nostradamus predicted everything from the Notre Dame Cathedral fire of 2019 to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the persistence of numerology in the desperate search for meaning in the aftermath of unimaginable horrors.It's significant that Donald Trump first endeared himself to many on the American right in 2011, when he became a leading and vocal proponent of yet another hyper-partisan conspiracy theory, ""birtherism"" -- the debunked claim that Obama was born outside the United States. During the 2016 election campaign, then-Republican candidate Trump granted an interview to Jones and Infowars, and appears to have been significantly influenced by some of the conspiracy theorist's pronouncements and political views. Four years later, and facing an uphill battle to defeat Democratic candidate Joe Biden, Trump refused to denounce or distance himself from QAnon -- a now infamous cluster of conspiracy theories whose proponents constituted a non-trivial cohort of Trump's base, and believed he was on a secret mission to protect the United States from a cabal of Satanic, child-sacrificing pedophiles led by prominent Democrats. Notably, QAnon had stemmed in part from Pizzagate, the 2016 conspiracy theory pushed by Jones and others.:In October 2020, Trump, the sitting president of the United States, promoted to his 87 million Twitter followers a bizarre conspiracy theory that claimed the operation that killed Bin Laden, mastermind of the attacks of 2001, had been a hoax. The journey from the ""9/11 truth"" movement to the age of QAnon had come full circle, two decades on.

In early December, another entirely baseless claim emerged, this time that Biden, supposedly while engaging in the deception of wearing an orthopedic boot, had absent-mindedly put it on the wrong foot. On Dec. 2, 2020, Facebook user Kris Sun posted two side-by-side pictures of Biden: one showing him with a gray boot on his left foot, and the other showing him wearing a black boot on his right foot::On Dec. 7, a TikTok user who regularly posts right-wing and pro-Trump memes and tropes posted a video that contrasted the same two photographs: Biden with a gray boot on his left foot; and Biden with a black boot on his right foot. She added the following caption: ""Sleepy Joe did you forget which ankle was fractured?"" :In reality, the picture of Biden wearing a gray boot on his left foot was digitally manipulated, and the the claim the president-elect had ""forgotten"" which foot was broken, and put his boot on the wrong foot, was entirely false. The original photograph was taken outside the Delaware Humane Association in November 2018 and shows Biden taking Major home after adopting him, a somewhat ironic twist, given the cause of Biden's broken foot, two years later.

685,685,265.WastheMandalayBaySec,"Claim:Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos worked in the Clinton Foundation's Las Vegas office before the mass shooting.Rating:FalseAbout this rating In mid-October 2017, the satirical web site FreedumJunkshun posted an article apparently aiming to take in ""truthers"" and paranoid Clinton-watchers, reporting that wounded Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos had not only ""vanished,"" but that he had worked for the Clinton Foundation's Las Vegas office. Citing a fabricated quote attributed Fox News, FreedumJunkshun stated::Then there's this tidbit from Fox News. It's two sentences, but they're very interesting sentences:Until last month, Campos worked a second job at the Clinton Foundation's Las Vegas office where he had been providing security services for more than five years.He resigned suddenly just before the attacks.Under FreedomJunkshun's ""about"" section, the web site clearly indicates is not intended to be taken seriously:We believe that there is nothing more precious than the mind of an aging conservative. Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate. Reality is often in the eye of the beholder. You won't find any of it here.Join the fun in the comments on our Facebook page where you too can watch David Hasselhoff running over someone's poodle magically transformed into a crime against humanity by Barack Obama or yet another murder the Clintons got away with.:We confirmed with the Clinton Foundation that they have no office in Las Vegas, and no current or past employees named Jesus Campos.Campos accidentally attracted the addled obsession of conspiracy theorists when he was shot in the leg while inspecting a reported open door on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on 1 October 2017. He was wounded in a hail of gunfire when mass shooter Stephen Paddock turned his weapon on the hallway before raining bullets down on a country music festival crowd of 22,000 below.Campos has been credited as a hero for his life-saving actions that night, which included warning a building engineer and a hotel guest to take cover, and helping police despite his injury until they ordered him to seek medical care. However his high-profile role in a mass shooting has inevitably resulted in intense scrutiny from a demented segment of the U.S. population known as ""truthers,' who believe every large-scale tragedy is engineered by the government to facilitate that take-over of the New World Order. It's an all-encompassing and deeply anti-Semitic conspiracy theory, made popular by the likes of occasionally-clothed, chair-hurling InfoWars conspiracy troll Alex Jones.:Since the mass shooting in which Paddock killed 58 people and wounded hundreds, Campos has been the target of much delusional speculation, including false allegations that he was an ""accomplice"" to Paddock and had been arrested, or that he had ""gone missing"" after cancelling a series of media interviews to seek medical treatment at a walk-in clinic days after being shot.Ending hyperbolic reports he had ""vanished"" while attempting to maintain a low profile, the soft-spoken Campos appeared on Ellen Degeneres' NBC talk show on 18 October 2017 alongside building engineer Stephen Schuck. The men recounted their narrow escape from death and said they were trying to heal after the trauma they experienced."
686,686,625.AmazonIssuesCreditsi,"Claim:Amazon is issuing credits to many customers due to the settlement of an e-book lawsuit.Rating:TrueAbout this rating On 21 June 2016, a number of Amazon.com shoppers were surprised to find (sometimes sizeable) credits had been applied to their accounts due to a recently settled lawsuit (over unfair competition in the e-book market) that they didn't know about.:The sudden appearance and relative ease of collection of these credits (customers didn't have to take any proactive steps to claim their shares) led to some skepticism among social media users familiar with the endless parade of online hoaxes and scams offering everything from free plane tickets to free Disney vacations to and free gift cards.However, the reports were accurate. Beginning in June 2016, Amazon members could click a link to determine whether they were eligible for (or had already received) credits good for any Amazon purchases. The main settlement page provides both general information and individual credit status:Information for 2016 Apple eBooks Antitrust SettlementIn November 2014, a federal court approved a Settlement of antitrust lawsuits brought against Apple, Inc. (""Apple"") by State Attorneys General and Class Plaintiffs about the price of electronic books (""eBooks""). Those settlements resulted in credits for qualifying Kindle books purchased between April 1, 2010 and May 21, 2012. These credits are funded by Apple.Eligible customers do not need to do anything to receive these credits. If you are eligible, we have already calculated your credit for you and added it to your Amazon account. As long as you have credit remaining we will automatically apply it to your purchase of qualifying items through Amazon.com, an Amazon device or an Amazon app. The credit applied to your purchase will appear in your order summary as a gift card during checkout and in your account history. Eligible customers should have received a notification email from Amazon on June 21, 2016. This credit will expire at 11:59pm PDT on June 24, 2017. You can learn more about the settlements at www.amazon.com/help/ApplebooksettlementFAQs. The credits are subject to these Terms and Conditions.Additional information about the lawsuit is available via a 2012 United States Department of Justice (DOJ) press release, as well as a 20 June 2016 release issued by involved lawyers. The DOJ's statement holds that entities party to the suit ""[conspired] to end e-book retailers' freedom to compete on price, take control of pricing from e-book retailers and substantially increase the prices that consumers pay for e-book, [and publishers] prevented retail price competition resulting in consumers paying millions of dollars more for their e-books"":""As a result of this alleged conspiracy, we believe that consumers paid millions of dollars more for some of the most popular titles,"" said Attorney General Eric Holder. ""We allege that executives at the highest levels of these companies-concerned that e-book sellers had reduced prices-worked together to eliminate competition among stores selling e-books, ultimately increasing prices for consumers.""""With today's lawsuit, we are sending a clear message that competitors, even in rapidly evolving technology industries, cannot conspire to raise prices,"" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Sharis A. Pozen in charge of the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division. ""We want to undo the harm caused by the companies' anticompetitive conduct and restore retail price competition so that consumers can pay lower prices for their e-books.""According to the complaint, the five publishers and Apple were unhappy that competition among e-book sellers had reduced e-book prices and the retail profit margins of the book sellers to levels they thought were too low. To address these concerns, they worked together to enter into contracts that eliminated price competition among bookstores selling e-books, substantially increasing prices paid by consumers. Before the companies began their conspiracy, retailers regularly sold e-book versions of new releases and bestsellers for, as described by one of the publisher's CEO, the ""wretched $9.99 price point."" As a result of the conspiracy, consumers are now typically forced to pay $12.99, $14.99, or more for the most sought-after e-books, the department said.The department alleges the conspiracy began in the summer of 2009. CEOs from the publishing companies met privately as a group about once per quarter. The meetings took place in private dining rooms of upscale Manhattan restaurants and were used to discuss confidential business and competitive matters, including Amazon's e-book's retailing practices.The complaint states that the companies accomplished their conspiracy by agreeing to stop the longstanding practice of selling e-books, as they long sold print books, on wholesale to bookstores, and leaving it to the bookstores to set the price at which they would sell the e-books to consumers. Through their conspiracy, the companies imposed a new model under which the publishers seized e-book pricing authority from all of their retail bookstores and raised prices for e-books.As stated in the department's complaint, one publisher's CEO said, ""Our goal is to force Amazon to return to acceptable sales prices through the establishment of agency contracts in the USA. . . . To succeed our colleagues must know that we entered the fray and follow us.""Amazon's appended Frequently Asked Questions page explains the settlement terms and defined eligibility for affected parties:Apple, Inc. (""Apple"") settled several antitrust lawsuits about eBook prices that were brought against Apple by a coalition of state Attorneys General, and by a Plaintiff Class. Amazon was not a party to these lawsuits. Under the settlements, Apple provided funds for credits that were applied directly to Amazon accounts of eligible customers in June 2016. The account credit appeared automatically and could be used to purchase eligible products sold through Amazon.com, an Amazon device or an Amazon app. For additional information, please visit www.EbookLawsuits.com.To be eligible, you must have had a U.S. billing address and must have purchased a Kindle book published by Hachette, HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster, Penguin or Macmillan between 4/1/10 and 5/21/12. Customers who returned these books or were refunded their money did not qualify.The FAQ also noted that no action is required on the part of customers to receive their credits; eligible parties will see credits applied to their accounts automatically on Amazon.com:Amazon added settlement credits to the accounts of eligible customers on June 21, 2016. You don't have to do anything to claim your credit. We will automatically apply the credit to your purchase of any item through Amazon.com. The credit applied to your purchase will appear as a gift card in your order summary during checkout and in your account history.The FAQ includes a link for signed-in users to view their current credit balance and confirms that the funds can be applied to nearly all Amazon purchases (with minor exclusions):You cannot use this credit to purchase Amazon gift cards or certain subscriptions. Otherwise, you can apply this credit to any item sold through Amazon.com, an Amazon device or an Amazon app.Coincidentally, the largely unexpected Amazon credits came on the heels of a similar class action settlement involving Ticketmaster. As with the Amazon disbursement, many Ticketmaster customers were pleased to learn that the terms of a settlement entitled those who'd purchased tickets through Ticketmaster.com between 1999 and 2013 to free passes and vouchers for a number of selected concerts. In both cases, customers were simply required to log into their accounts on those web sites to redeem their credits or vouchers.:"
687,687,415.DidDavidHoggGiveaNaz,"Claim:David Hogg gave a Nazi salute at the end of his ""March for Our Lives"" speech.Rating:FalseAbout this rating The historic groundswell of support for survivors of the 14 February 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that killed seventeen people has not come without seemingly endless attempts to minimize or smear the message of those who are advocating for gun control.:For example, when high school student David Hogg finished his speech at the ""March for Our Lives"" demonstration, a student-led protest aimed at preventing school shootings, he raised his clenched fist into the air as a classic symbol of defiance, solidarity, and strength -- and some predictable attempts to liken his gesture to a Nazi salute. Numerous memes and doctored images were created labeling Hogg a Nazi, and further claiming that the teenaged mass shooting survivor gave a Hitler salute at the end of his speech. For example, the following image comparison topped an article on discredited conspiracy theory blog Infowars.com, which called Hogg (and the other students who participated in the march) ""Hitler Youths""::Several others on social media also compared Hogg to Hitler and said that his closing gesture resembled a Nazi salute:Despite the increasingly hysterical tone of would-be smear campaigners, Hogg did not actually give a Nazi salute at the end of his ""March for Our Lives"" speech. Videos are readily available on the Internet with a minimum of searching which show, extremely clearly, that Hogg stepped back from the podium at the end of his remarks and then raised a single closed fist into the air. :It's unclear how this gesture could be confused with the infamous Nazi salute, which involved an open hand with the palm down, not a closed fist:The Nazi or Hitler salute debuted in Nazi Germany in the 1930s as a way to pay homage to Adolf Hitler. It consists of raising an outstretched right arm with the palm down. In Nazi Germany, it was often accompanied by chanting or shouting ""Heil Hitler"" or ""Sieg Heil."" Since World War II, neo-Nazis and other white supremacists have continued to use the salute, making it the most common white supremacist hand sign in the world.:A raised fist does have its own political meanings, none of are associated with Nazis. The symbol has been used by numerous oppressed groups over the years as a sign of solidarity, resistance, and strength:The early origins of the raised fist hint at how it would be used many centuries later. According to Assyrian Origins, a book on Assyrian art edited by former Met Museum curator Prudence O. Harper, artworks depicting the clenched fist date back to ancient times and were associated with procreation, prayer, and ""the manifestation of sheer physical strength."" The raised fist became a go-to symbol for solidarity and strength for labor unions, American leftists, civil rights activists, white supremacists, and the Black Panther Party. In 1971, Ms. co-founders Gloria Steinem and Dorothy Pitman Hughes posed for an iconic photograph in Esquire magazine, raising their fists in interracial solidarity. But arguably its most famous use in the recent American history is by Olympians John Carlos and Tommie Smith during their awards ceremony at the 1968 games in Mexico City. Carlos and Smith's ""black power salute"" got them suspended from the U.S. team and turned them into galvanizing figures.:"
688,688,390.AOCChallengerTinaFor,"Republican Tina Forte is running in 2022 to claim the New York seat in Congress currently held by U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.Ocasio-Cortez, better known as AOC, is a Democrat. During a recent investigation into QAnon activity on Facebook, our research led us to social media accounts managed by Forte, which included heavy promotion of the deadly Jan. 6 ""Save America"" rally, the event that resulted in the Capitol riot that left law enforcement officers bloodied. Five people died just before, during, or after the riot, and dozens were injured.We found Forte repeatedly used hashtags related to QAnon conspiracy theories. The QAnon mentions even included cries of ""Save the Children,"" referring to the debunked conspiracy theory that makes claims of mass pedophilia and ""Satanic blood-drinking"" by Democrats. She took multiple photographs in October, November, and December 2020 with far-right Proud Boys leader Henry ""Enrique"" Tarrio. Further, we uncovered evidence that Forte pushed false election conspiracy theories, including the phrase ""Stop the Steal."":Forte's accounts that pushed potentially dangerous content were still active months later on Facebook, Instagram (which is owned by Facebook), Twitter, and YouTube. Even more striking was the fact that Forte herself attended the Capitol riot, where she livestreamed on Facebook. She took selfies with a number of attendees who considered her a ""superstar."" In a live video, she urged people at then-U.S. President Donald Trump's rally on the Ellipse to make their way to the Capitol. We even found that she entered a restricted area after the crowd knocked down barriers that law enforcement installed. All of her posts promoting the date in the weeks before Jan. 6 appeared to reach at least tens of thousands of people, but likely many more.Her live videos from the Capitol riot were still available on Facebook more than seven months after the deadly insurrection. Forte also used Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's platform to promote T-shirts, hoodies, and other ""patriot gear"" merchandise.We reached out to Forte for comment on her actions and received a statement after this story was published. We also contacted the social media platforms. All statements and answers appear lower in this story.:Jan. 6 Capitol Riot""How are you doing everybody? I'm in front of the Capitol right now.""In a livestreamed video, Forte stood in front of a massive poster of artwork that she brought with her. The art depicted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. It was created by Scott LoBaido and purportedly measured 40 feet by 30 feet. Forte and others laid it out on the ground. The poster altered Pelosi's appearance, giving her fangs and a somewhat menacing appearance. ""Hey just let us know when we can walk across this c - - -,"" one man off-camera said. Earlier that morning, Forte had unfurled it at the Lincoln Memorial, according to a Twitter video that received 5,350 retweets, 851 quote tweets, and 12,700 likes. Newsmax correspondent Mike Carter also recorded a video of Forte early in the day at the same place. He then appeared to show her the tweet while she was livestreaming.:After Forte left the Lincoln Memorial, she made her way toward the Capitol. When she arrived in front of the building, she said in a Facebook Live video: ""Get your asses to the Capitol."" She was speaking to viewers who were watching from the Ellipse, where Trump was speaking. ""We need to fight for our freedom, fight for our country, fight for our president, fight for our Constitution."" After this moment, one of several people who wanted a picture with Forte asked her: ""Quick pic?"" He then called her a ""superstar."":""So we're out here in front of the Capitol right now, waiting for everybody who's at the rally at the Ellipse to head over,"" she said. After another person asked for a selfie with her, Forte told her viewers: ""People need to leave the Ellipse and get to the Capitol. So if anybody who has service over there and is watching this, get your ass to the Capitol.""Yet again, a third fan recognized Forte from social media and seemed happy to see her. She then told viewers of her livestream: ""Do not comply."" A man on a bullhorn then asked that vulgar language be toned down because of the presence of ""young children."" Forte responded: ""Please, if you're sensitive, go home."" She then added: ""If I want to fucking curse, I'll fucking curse."" Before the video ended, she claimed to be wearing a bulletproof vest.Despite initially unfurling the Pelosi poster in a public space, Forte and others carried the artwork into a restricted area on the lawn in front of the Capitol. To reach the lawn, the crowd knocked down fencing that read: ""AREA CLOSED. By order of the United States Capitol Police Board."" The video was reposted by the Twitter user @DianthaSol.:The original upload of the video by Forte received at least 46,000 views. It was tweeted at 1:58 p.m. EDT in D.C., just eight minutes after the event was officially declared a riot. It has since been either deleted by her or removed by Twitter.In the clip, she agrees with the idea of the rioters ""storming the Capitol."" Forte also referred to artist Scott LoBaido's flag, saying, ""we came with Scott's flag and shit happened,"" which might have been Forte's way of crediting the massive flag of Pelosi with helping, in part, in the effort to incite the mob.:https://twitter.com/DianthaSol/status/1430364134009409544/photo/1A different Twitter account spotted Forte earlier in the day at the 2:53 mark in this video. She's briefly visible and masked, with ""Trump 2020"" across her forehead.Seven minutes before the scene was officially declared a riot by the Washington, D.C., police department, Forte tweeted a link to her Cameo account, an apparent effort to earn money based on what was unfolding at the Capitol.Further, on the afternoon of Jan. 6, Forte said in a new Twitter video: ""We spoke today, and we spoke loud and proud, and we're not violent."" However, as of Aug. 24, The Associated Press reported that ""nearly 600 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the riots in the six months since the siege,"" and that ""dozens have been charged with assaulting police officers who were trying to protect the Capitol."" The Washington Post reported that 140 law enforcement officers were injured in the Capitol riot. Further, CNBC published that Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died the day after the riot, and four other officers also later died by suicide.:In another video also tweeted late in the day on Jan. 6, Forte wrote in the caption: ""We the warriors have come out to play ... now what?""On Jan. 7, a quote tweet from Forte appeared to show she had been emboldened by the violent riot, an event that perhaps forever scarred the lives of so many law enforcement officers who defended the building from the conspiracy theory-fueled mob.:Promoting Jan. 6 on FacebookAs of August 2021, Forte's personal Facebook profile had more than 56,600 followers. She also posted to pages named The Real Tina 40, which had nearly 37,000 followers, as well as a page created months later: Real Tina for Congress.Even more noteworthy than Forte's attendance at the Capitol riot was the fact that her social media posts promoting Jan. 6 beforehand were perhaps displayed to hundreds of thousands of users.On Dec. 27, 2020, she reposted a video that promoted the Jan. 6 ""Save America"" rally, the same rally that took place before the riot at the Capitol. Her post was shared 2,800 times, meaning that at least tens of thousands of Facebook users likely saw that single post. ""Get ready because we are coming,"" Forte said. ""I'll be there!!,"" one man said in the comments. ""I'll see you there ... message me when you're on your way Jan. 6,"" another person commented.:Forte's repost of the video was shared several times in the Facebook group named Trump/Pence 2020 Reelection Group, a group that appeared to have three accounts under a similar name: Marc Minori, Mark Todd Minor, and Mark T. Minor. The three accounts appeared to exist as backups in case Facebook were to remove one or more of the accounts. We also uncovered examples of the Facebook group being used as a place to organize and promote attendance leading up to Jan. 6. It did not appear that Forte herself had any involvement in managing that Facebook group.On Jan. 2, Forte shared to her followers a schedule showing when they could board a bus from various cities for Jan. 6. In another post, a video posted by Forte featured a ""January 6th"" caption with a scene from the end of the Mel Gibson film ""The Patriot."" In the scene, Americans charge the British to gain victory. On Jan. 6, rather than the British, Americans violently brutalized their own law enforcement officers. A second post and tweet was also made by Forte the same day, where she wrote: ""Trump will be speaking directly to us on 1/6. He will be giving directions of where and when to be leading up to the events. His directions will be the only ones to follow, if you want to win."":Forte tweeted this on Jan. 2, 2021.On Jan. 3, she posted a meme that said: ""Stand by. Shit is about to get real."" On the same day, she shared a digital artwork creation showing the calm before ""the storm"" that was to come on Jan. 6. ""My friends and I are heading over from Texas,"" one commenter posted.Forte posted this on Jan. 3, 2021.:On Jan. 5, she uploaded a meme that said: ""It's time."" That night, a man identified as Will Johnson spoke at a dinner Forte attended, just hours before the Capitol riot began. In the video, which was hosted by Facebook and remained available months later, Johnson said: ""I would rather die a free man for this country and every single person in this country and God almighty. Be safe, and get ready for a fight."":Forte posted this on Jan. 5, 2021.Forte's posts that promoted Jan. 6 did not simply receive a few likes. Nearly all received extensive engagement. The posts often had hundreds or thousands of likes, comments, and shares in total. In one of the posts prior to Jan. 6, she shared one of her appearances on Newsmax. In fact, Newsmax also spoke with Forte over the phone on the day of the Capitol riot. Slate.com reported on the interview, quoting Forte saying the words ""we are in our house.""At one point, [Rob] Schmitt did a phone interview with an ""influencer"" named Tina Forte, on the scene on Capitol Hill, who in a thick New York/New Jersey accent announced that ""this is our house, and we have the right to be here. ... We are in our house, OK? And we have a right to be heard."" You could almost hear the rage spittle in her voice.Despite her having said ""We are in our house,"" there was no direct evidence in Forte's posts placing her inside the Capitol building. We asked her if she entered the building. She answered, in a full statement provided after this article was first published, as follows: ""I absolutely did NOT enter the Capitol building. In fact, myself and my group were there well before 12:30pm and we were basically the only ones in front of the Reflection Pool with our flag. We stood there for about one hour and then saw masses coming toward the building. Before that there was a group of about 100 people who passed us but continued on which wound up being the front of The Capitol, as we later found out. We immediately left and walked back to our hotel. All of this documented and pinned because we were looking for a friend who was doing a news show I was supposed to be a guest on."":On Twitter, Forte tweeted multiple times to promote the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Five of the tweets were retweeted and liked more than 40,000 times. One of the tweets from Dec. 29 read: ""I do not trust Republicans to do the right thing on January 6th but We The People have your back @realDonaldTrump and we will be there ! #FightForTrump."" Two days later, she tweeted: ""If the Constitution is not upheld on January 6th ......we are no longer the United States of America."" That tweet alone was retweeted more than 3,000 times and received well over 17,000 likes.Forte tweeted this on Dec. 31, 2020.:On Jan. 2, she posted a Twitter video where she said of Trump and Jan. 6: ""If you want to win this, follow the president's lead."" Another video promoting the rally was also shared and viewed thousands of times, as was this clip on Jan. 4 that documented her travels to Washington, D.C.It appears that Forte's original Instagram account (@realtina40) may have been removed. On Jan. 23, Forte posted to a brand new Instagram account: ""I will not be silenced."" According to one of her Facebook posts, Instagram removed her original account when she had around 80,000 followers.As for Forte's YouTube channel, the most recent video was uploaded on Nov. 30, 2020. It's possible that several videos related to the Capitol riot were removed, or that she received a suspension of some sort. However, we were unable to find any data to confirm this.'Stop the Steal':In addition to Jan. 6 promotion, Forte also pushed debunked election conspiracy theories to thousands of people. We found multiple mentions of ""Stop the Steal.""Facebook was a hub for the organization and discussion surrounding all of the rallies and protests for the 2020 election, including the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.:In a video on Twitter, Forte tweeted ""NYC STOP THE STEAL"" and claimed falsely ""they stole the election.""She also tweeted various conspiracy theories and explanations that purportedly showed how the election had been ""rigged.""This one tweet from a month before the Capitol riot received 510 replies, 3,500 retweets, and 23,300 likes.:On YouTube, she posted a video titled ""This was stolen."" In another clip on YouTube, Forte said, without evidence, that ""they're trying to steal the election."" We also found evidence of ""Stop the Steal"" on her merchandise website.Posts with misleading information about the election, first ignited by Trump, were taken to heart and led, in part, to the events that unfolded at the Capitol on Jan. 6.QAnonOn Facebook, Forte twice posted the same photograph of her wearing a ""WWG1WGA"" hat. The acronym stands for ""Where We Go One, We Go All."" It's one of the slogans associated with the QAnon conspiracy theory.:Courtesy: FacebookFacebook had previously announced, on Oct. 6, 2020, that it would ""remove any Facebook Pages, Groups and Instagram accounts representing QAnon, even if they contain no violent content."" The company's policy updates are available on the Facebook Newsroom website.Two days after this policy update, Forte appeared in a video with Proud Boys leader Henry ""Enrique"" Tarrio. The Proud Boys are described by The Associated Press as a ""far right fascist group."" In August 2021, Axios reported that Tarrio was sentenced to five months in jail for burning a Black Lives Matter flag in Washington, D.C., on Dec. 12, 2020. Forte appeared in a photograph with Tarrio on the very same day.This photograph was taken on Dec. 12, the same day in which the crime committed by Tarrio landed him in jail for five months.:We also found multiple times when Forte posed with Tarrio in 2020, including twice in October, once in November, and others. She seemed to often appear where the Proud Boys showed up.Quite a few of Forte's posts shortened ""#WWG1WGA"" to just ""#WW1WGA,"" which may have been a purposeful attempt to evade detection by Facebook. We also found posts mentioning ""#redpill"" and ""awakening,"" which also appear to be references to QAnon.A video posted across Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and perhaps also Instagram, included the words ""save the children,"" which refer to the conspiracy theory about pedophilia and the drinking of children's blood. She claimed that Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram wanted to ""censor the truth about what's going on with the child trafficking.""Forte posted the video while driving her car. The tweet for the same video showed 97,000 views, 1,747 retweets, 396 quote tweets, and 5,328 likes. On Facebook, the video was seen 22,000 times.FalloutWe contacted media relations representatives for Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Google, with questions about this content in relation to their policies. We also asked Instagram about her previous account.In our correspondence with Facebook, we asked if the company had a statement it would like to give on the platform being used to both heavily promote Jan. 6 and as a place where content was livestreamed by Forte the same day. We asked about the Facebook group that had duplicate accounts by similar names. We inquired about Forte's old Instagram account, as well as the policies of creating a new account when an older one broke the rules. Lastly, we asked if Facebook gives any exemptions or special treatment to users if they are running for Congress, or if the rules apply evenly to all users.In response, Facebook provided this statement: ""We have removed several posts for violating our Dangerous Organizations and Individuals policies. Our teams are continuing to investigate the content, Pages, and accounts and will remove any further content that violates our policies.""A Facebook spokesperson told us after we sent over our questions and data that several posts were removed for the promotion of ""Stop the Steal,"" as was a photo of her praising the Proud Boys leader. The platform appeared to take action on the duplicate accounts of the same name administering the Trump group. They told us that all users, even if they are politicians or are running for office, are subject to the company's Community Standards.Hours after this story was published, Forte's Instagram account, @officialrealtina40, was no longer available. It appeared to have been removed by the platform. Forte had advertised in her bio that her previous account had also been removed.We also received a response from Twitter. A company spokesperson said: ""The account you referenced is not currently in violation of the Twitter Rules."" They also included a link to a summary of how they handled Jan. 6 content. As for the fact that Forte is running for Congress, they told us that they are still evaluating their world leader policy. However, they said there are no exemptions or special treatments in place for candidates to political office.We did not receive a response from YouTube.Tina ForteAfter uncovering the data in this report, we reached out to Forte at the email address listed on her campaign website and social media pages. We asked her if she went into the Capitol building on Jan. 6 and if she is a QAnon believer. We also asked if she believes her social media activity may have contributed in any way to the events that unfolded on Jan. 6. Finally, we asked her about her thoughts on the Capitol riot, now that several months have passed.After this story was published, Forte's team reached out to us with a full statement from the candidate herself. A PDF is available or it can be found below:Hello,No, I was not a part of the Capitol Riot on January 6th. I was there for a flag drop of Nancy Pelosi for artist Scott Lobaido. That was planned for 2 weeks prior to January 6th. We had a plan of unveiling first at the Lincoln Memorial, the Washington Monument and ending at the Capitol. I didn't even go to Trump's speech, which I was invited to.I absolutely did NOT enter the Capitol building. In fact, myself and my group were there well before 12:30pm and we were basically the only ones in front of the Reflection Pool with our flag. We stood there for about one hour and then saw masses coming toward the building. Before that there was a group of about 100 people who passed us but continued on which wound up being the front of The Capitol, as we later found out. We immediately left and walked back to our hotel. All of this documented and pinned because we were looking for a friend who was doing a news show I was supposed to be a guest on.I have said it again and again, what happened at the Capitol is disgusting. I do not condone violence or destruction on either side. I am not nor will I ever be a part of that. As far as Stop The Steal, do I believe there was voter fraud? Absolutely. That's my opinion. There is fraud in every election.QAnon is a group of right-wing conspiracy theorists. I do not associate with them and I never will. I am a Republican who is fiscally conservative and socially liberal. I believe that everyone can have an opinion and I never condone violence on either side. I was sent a hat once by a fan and wore it to post a photo. I had zero clue the phrase was a QAnon phrase because I don't follow that ridiculousness.As for alleged photos with certain individuals, I have fans and supporters all over the world from social media, flag drops and rallies. I get asked for photos routinely and do not have taxpayer funded private security like AOC to screen everyone who wants to greet or get a photo with me. These are in no way an endorsement or condemnation of any group or individual.Recently, Forte made an appearance at a school board meeting where she interrupted the proceedings to rant about not wanting children to wear masks for protection against the COVID-19 virus. Her objections were lodged at the same time that children's hospitals in several states were overwhelmed with sick kids who had been infected during the global pandemic. Children under the age of 12 were not yet eligible for the vaccine.Alexandria Ocasio-CortezAccording to The Associated Press, on Feb. 2, AOC ""opened up about the Capitol attack and her past sexual assault in an Instagram Live video."" Despite the alarming and tragic nature of the events of Jan. 6, this led to claims from internet commenters and right-wing bloggers who said she exaggerated the danger she was in during the riot. However, as we previously reported, these claims by the right-wing voices were highly misleading.We reached out to Ocasio-Cortez to seek her comment about Forte's posts that we uncovered. However, we did not receive a response. This story will be updated should we receive any additional information."
689,689,80.TopTen911RumorsandCo,"The 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon were a horrific event that spawned a panoply of rumors and conspiracy theories, perhaps greater in number and scope than those prompted by any other event in human history. On the 14th anniversary of that tragic occurrence, we present a list of the ten most widely circulated entries from our collection of 9/11-related items.1) False Prophecy  :This claim about French physician and astrologer Nostradamus' supposedly having predicted the September 11 attacks is the granddaddy of all 9/11 rumors, the first one to hit big and go viral, winging its way all over the Internet by the end of that awful day. 2) Daisy Unchained  :We all wanted to believe in, and be reassured by, the thought of courageous rescuers risking their own lives to gallantly save countless souls from the burning, shattered buildings of the World Trade Center on 9/11. This popular tale of one such putative rescuer by the name of Daisy tugged at heartstrings all the more for featuring a canine hero.3) This Bud's Not for You  :Tales of Arabs living in America supposedly celebrating the 9/11 attacks were legion in the aftermath of September 11, and the ""Budweiser Story"" legend resonated with many people for its plot of a beer distributor striking back against such celebrants.4) The Accidental Tourist  : For two months after the 9/11 attacks, the Internet was tantalized by an image of a jetliner bearing down on a doomed tourist standing atop a World Trade Center observation deck. Long after the photo was debunked as a digital manipulation, the burning question remained: Just who was the 'tourist guy' pictured in that image?5) Wingdings  :One of the more bizarre post-9/11 rumors held that Microsoft's Webdings and Wingdings fonts included hidden anti-Semitic and 9/11-referential messages. 6) Uniform Behavior  :Rumors of potential schemes for future terrorist attacks were rampant after 9/11, and one of the most prominent held that a large number of ""missing"" UPS uniforms had been acquired by persons with bad intentions.7) Atta Boy   Finger-pointing was a common pastime after 9/11, and one popular partisan political rumor sought to blame either Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan for insisting that Israel release convicted bus bomber Mohammed Atta from life imprisonment, thus freeing him to mastermind the September 11 attacks years later.:8) Oliver Twisted  From the ""We should have listened"" file: Popular rumor claimed that back in 1987 Col. Oliver North had warned Congress that Osama bin Laden was ""the most evil person alive"" and advocated his assassination, but Congress didn't heed him. But that wasn't really what he said.:9) Store Honors Islamic Martyr Every September since 2009 has seen the circulation of a signed displayed by Perfume Planet store at the Harwin Central Mart in Houston, Texas, supposedly informing customers that the store would be closed on September 11 to honor one of the terrorists martyred in the 9/11 attacks.:10) Absent Without Leave Many 9/11 conspiracy theories focused on persons or groups who supposedly had foreknowledge of the September 11 attacks. The most prevalent rumor of this ilk held that 4,000 Israelis employed in the World Trade Center all mysteriously stayed home from work on September 11."
690,690,496.DoFBIAgentsHaveanAnt,"Claim:FBI agents formed a secret society to oppose President Donald Trump.Rating:FalseAbout this rating On 23 January 2018, some United States lawmakers laboring under the impression that a secret anti-Trump society was afoot among the ranks of the Federal Bureau of Investigation went on television to make that claim-- only to later walk back their comments after the source was revealed to be an apparent joke.:This latest fevered conspiracy theory to sweep the right-wing cable news and Internet ecosystem is founded in accusations from Republicans that an FBI-led criminal probe into alleged collusion between the Kremlin and associates of the U.S. president is stacked against him due to purported anti-Trump bias at the FBI. The November 2016 text message between two FBI employees on which the latest Russia probe-related rumor is based reads:Are you even going to give out your calendars? Seems kind of depressing. Maybe it should just be the first meeting of the secret society.That message was among a cache of exchanges between FBI attorney Lisa Page and agent Peter Strzok, who used their government-issued phones to communicate with each other while carrying on an extramarital affair. Because they shared with each other unfavorable opinions about U.S. President Donald Trump, and because Strzok was until July 2017 a member of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team investigating allegations of collusion between the Kremlin and President Trump's associates, congressional Republicans have claimed the messages prove the Russia investigation is biased (although Mueller pulled Strzok off his team when he learned of the texts).:On 24 January 2018, ABC News obtained the above message and reported it verbatim. It was sent from Page to Strzok one day after the 8 November 2016 election, and it was apparently an inside joke referencing not the planning stages of a secret society meeting but a Vladimir Putin-themed calendar -- a gag gift meant to be given to other Russia investigators.Before the message's entire text and context were made public, however, wild speculation about an FBI ""secret society"" bounded through right-wing web sites and cable news. On his personal web site, Fox News personality Sean Hannity reported:A recent treasure trove of text messages exchanged between FBI officials reveal a covert ""secret society"" at the bureau, suggesting a cabal of officials at the Department of Justice sought to oppose President Trump the day after his election.According to Fox News, Peter Strzok -a senior FBI agent involved in the investigation of Hillary Clinton's private email server- sent multiple messages to DOJ lawyer Lisa Page, mentioning a ""secret society"" to fight the Trump agenda in November 2016.:This narrative picked up significant steam when members of Congress including Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-South Carolina) and Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas) jumped into the fray, even going on Fox to talk about a ""secret society"" during their appearances on the influential conservative cable network. It got a significant push by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin), who chairs the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.Johnson appeared on Fox News on 23 January 2018 and reported that an unnamed ""informant"" had told him about secretive ""off-site"" meetings among FBI agents:So what this is all about is further evidence of corruption -- more than bias but corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, now secret society? We have an informant that's talking about a group that were holding secret meetings off-site. There's so much smoke here, there's so much suspicion....We sent Johnson's spokesman Austin Altenburg a detailed list of questions asking for clarification of Johnson's statements and to elaborate further on the reliability of his source. We received no response. But Johnson's comments put the unfounded story back in headlines, with sites like DailyCaller.com reporting ""Senator Confirms Existence Of FBI 'Secret Society,' Says He Has Informant."":Johnson walked back his claim about the secret society on 25 January 2018, amid backlash from political rivals like Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-New York) who called it ""delusional."" But when questioned by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel about his comments, Johnson stood by his claims of having an informant who spoke of secret off-site FBI meetings:We're not going to be deterred at all by whatever comments, derogatory-wise, that Sen. Schumer made.Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer who is now co-director of the governmental accountability group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and a University of Minnesota Law School professor, told us that aside from misusing government-issued phones, neither Strzok or Page broke the law. It's likely, he added, the reason they were using their work phones was to hide their affair from their spouses, not to plot against Trump in their capacity as FBI employees.:He added that there's no evidence of an anti-Trump bias at the FBI. Not only has the story has been blown out of proportion, he said, ""the whole thing is stupid."" He added:They're making a big whoopty-do about nothing. One of them [Strzok] was hired by Mueller and when Mueller found out he was using the phone for that purpose he canned him. If they had been using their personal phones to talk about Trump, they would have been perfectly in their right to do so.You are bound to find career government workers who don't like Trump, and you're bound to find career government workers who send text messages about not liking Trump, and among those you are going to find some that are in each other's beds when they shouldn't' be. Big deal. Congress shouldn't be wasting our money looking through the texts of these bozos. The only people whose time it's worth going through their texts are divorce attorneys on behalf of their spouses."
691,691,569.ClintonBodyBags,"Claim:Bill Clinton has quietly done away with several dozen people who possessed incriminating evidence about him.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Multiple versions of lengthy lists of deaths associated with Bill Clinton have been circulating online for about twenty years now (including the latest iteration, titled ""The List of Clinton Associates Who Allegedly Died Mysteriously. Check It Out""). According to those lists, close to fifty colleagues, advisors, and citizens who were about to testify against the Clintons died in suspect circumstances, with the unstated implication being that Bill Clinton or his henchmen were behind each untimely demise.:We shouldn't have to tell anyone not to believe this claptrap, but we will anyway. In a frenzied media climate where the Chief Executive couldn't boff a White House intern without the whole world finding out every niggling detail of each encounter and demanding his removal from office, are we seriously to believe the same man had been having double handfuls of detractors and former friends murdered with impunity?Don't be swayed by the number of names listed on screeds like this. Any public figure is bound to have a much wider circle of acquaintance than an ordinary citizen would. Moreover, the acquaintanceship is often one-sided: though many of the people enumerated on this list might properly claim to have ""known"" Clinton, he wouldn't know or remember having met a great number of them.""Body count"" lists are not a new phenomenon. Lists documenting all the allegedly ""suspicious"" deaths of persons connected with the assassination of John F. Kennedy have been circulating for decades, and the same techniques used to create and spread the JFK lists have been employed in the Clinton version::List every dead person with even the most tenuous of connections to your subject. It doesn't matter how these people died, or how tangential they were to your subject's life. The longer the list, the more impressive it looks and the less likely anyone will be to challenge it. By the time readers get to the bottom of the list, they'll be too weary to wonder what could possibly be relevant about the death of people such as Bill Clinton's mother's chiropractor.Play word games. Make sure every death is presented as ""mysterious."" All accidental deaths are to be labelled ""suspicious,"" even though by definition accidents occur when something unexpected goes wrong. Every self-inflicted death discussed must include the phrase ""ruled a suicide"" to imply just the opposite. When an autopsy contradicts a ""mysterious death"" theory, dispute it; when none was performed because none was needed, claim that ""no autopsy was allowed."" Make liberal use of words such as 'allegedly' and 'supposedly' to dismiss facts you can't support or contradict with hard evidence.Make sure every inconsistency or unexplained detail you can dredge up is offered as evidence of a conspiracy, no matter how insignificant or pointless it may be. If an obvious suicide is discovered wearing only one shoe, ignore the physical evidence of self-inflicted death and dwell on the missing shoe. You don't have to establish an alternate theory of the death; just keep harping that the missing shoe ""can't be explained."":If the data doesn't fit your conclusion, ignore it. You don't have to explain why the people who claimed to have the most damaging goods on Bill Clinton (e.g., Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, Linda Tripp, Monica Lewinsky, Kenneth Starr), walked around unscathed while dozens of bit players were supposedly bumped off. It's inconvenient for you, so don't mention it.Most important, don't let facts and details stand in your way! If you can pass off a death by pneumonia as a ""suicide,"" do it! If a cause of death contradicts your conspiracy theory, claim it was ""never determined."" If your chronology of events is impossible, who cares? It's not like anybody is going to check up on this stuff ...Multiple versions of this ""body count"" list have been circulating online for two decades now. New victim names are routinely added and old ones taken off, forming an endless variety of permutations. At this point, there is no one ""official"" list.But where did all this craziness start? In a 1994 letter to congressional leaders, former Rep. William Dannemeyer listed 24 people with some connection to Clinton who had died ""under other than natural circumstances"" and called for hearings on the matter.:Dannemeyer's list of ""suspicious deaths"" was largely taken from one compiled by Linda Thompson, an Indianapolis lawyer who in 1993 quit her year-old general practice to run her American Justice Federation, a for-profit group that promotes pro-gun causes and various conspiracy theories through a shortwave radio program, a computer bulletin board, and sales of its newsletter and videos.Her list, called ""The Clinton Body Count: Coincidence or the Kiss of Death?"" then contained the names of 34 people she believed had died suspiciously and who had ties to the Clinton family. Thompson admitted she had ""no direct evidence"" of Clinton's killing anyone. Indeed, she said the deaths were probably caused by ""people trying to control the President"" but refused to say who they were. Thompson said her allegations of murder ""seem groundless only because the mainstream media haven't done enough digging.""Ah, but they had. If not before she put her list together, at least afterwards. Anyone who continues to state the mainstream media has given these claims short shrift is being disingenuous.:Since 1994, various respected news outlets have been confronted with versions of the ""Clinton Body Count"" list, run their own investigations of a few of the claims, and found nothing to substantiate what they looked into. Those investigations would culminate in yet another story about an oddball conspiracy rumor.But conspiracy theories don't die that easily. These ""body count"" lists and the many specious claims contained therein continue to circulate in cyberspace and beyond: yesterday's newspaper articles are forgotten with the next day's delivery, but e-mail lives forever.A 2007 version of the ""Clinton Body Count"" list was headed with this entry:James McDougal -- Clinton's convicted Whitewater partner died of an apparent heart attack, while in solitary confinement. He was a key witness in Ken Starr's investigation.James McDougal, a key witness for Whitewater prosecutors when the investigation centered on an Arkansas land deal in which the president and McDougal were involved, had a pre-existing heart condition and died of a heart attack on 8 March 1998 while in solitary confinement at the Federal Medical Center prison in Fort Worth. The ailing McDougal had been placed in solitary as punishment for failing to provide a urine sample for a drug test. On the day before his death and while still in his regular cell (where he had access to his heart medications), he had complained of dizziness, and while being processed for isolation he threw up. However, once in isolation, he did not ask for his medicines and appeared to guards ""alert, well-oriented and absent any visible signs of distress"" right up until his death. An investigation into the circumstances of his demise did not find evidence of foul play.:(The McDougal entry was not part of the ""Clinton Body Count"" list as it circulated in 1998.)1. Mary Mohane -- former White House intern gunned down in a coffee shop. Nothing was taken. It was suspected that she was about to testify about sexual harassment at the White House.Former White House intern Mary Caitrin Mahoney, 25, manager of a Georgetown Starbucks, was killed along with two co-workers (Emory Allen Evans, 25, and Aaron David Goodrich, 18) on 6 July 1997 during a robbery of the shop. In March 1999, Carl Derek Havord Cooper (29) of Washington was arrested and charged with these murders.Yes, it is unusual that three employees were killed in the course of a robbery during which nothing was taken. According to Cooper's 26 April 2000 guilty plea (he received life with no hope of parole), he went to the Starbucks to rob the place, figuring the receipts from the July 4 weekend would make for a fat take. He came in after closing, waved a .38, and ordered all three Starbucks employees into the back room. Once there, Mahoney made a run for it after Cooper fired a warning shot into the ceiling. She was ordered back to the room, but then went for the gun. Cooper shot her, then afterwards shot the other two employees. He left empty-handed, afraid the shots had attracted police attention. As regrettable as these three deaths were, this was nothing but a case of a robbery gone wrong.:And, right away, we have come to the first big lie of the ""Clinton Body Count"" list: Any unexplained death can automatically be attributed to President Clinton by inventing a connection between him and the victim. Mary Mahoney did once work as an intern at the White House, but so have hundreds of other people who are all still alive. There is no credible reason why, of all the interns who have served in the Clinton White House, Mahoney alone would be the target of a Clinton-directed killing. (Contrary to public perception, very few interns work in the West Wing of the White House or have any contact with the President. The closest most interns get to the chief executive is a single brief handshake or group photo.)The putative reason offered for Mahoney's slaying, that she was about to testify about sexual harrassment in the White House, was a lie. This absurd justification apparently sprang from a hint dropped by Mike Isikoff of Newsweek just before the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke that a ""former White House staffer"" with the initial ""M"" was about to talk about her affair with Clinton. We all know now, of course, that the ""staffer"" referred to was Monica Lewinsky, not Mary Mahoney. The conspiracy buffs maintained that White House hit men rushed out, willy-nilly, and gunned down the first female ex-intern they could find whose name began with ""M."":2. Vincent Foster -- former White House Counsel, found dead of a gunshot wound to the head and ruled a suicide. He had significant knowledge of the Clintons' financial affairs and was a business partner with Hillary. If the Clintons are guilty of the crimes they are accused of by Larry, Vincent Foster would have detailed knowledge of those crimes.This laundry list of deaths always refers to someone taking his life as ""ruled a suicide,"" thus implying another conclusion of equal likelihood was capriciously dismissed by someone who had the power to do so. From here on, read ""ruled a suicide"" as ""an investigation was carried out and arrived at this ruling as the only reasonable conclusion.""White House deputy counsel Vince Foster committed suicide on the night of 20 July 1993 by shooting himself once in the head, a day after he contacted his doctor about his depression. A note in the form of a draft resignation letter was found in the bottom of his briefcase a week after his death. (Note that this letter was not, as is often claimed, a ""suicide note""; it was Foster's outline for a letter of resignation.) Foster cited negative Wall Street Journal editorials about him, as well as the much-criticized role of the counsel's office in the controversial firing of seven White House travel office workers.:On 10 October 1997, special prosecutor Kenneth Starr released his report on the investigation into Foster's death, the third such investigation (after ones conducted by the coroner and Starr's predecessor, Robert B. Fiske) of the matter. The 114-page summary of a three-year investigation concluded that Foster shot himself with the pistol discovered in his right hand. There was no sign of a struggle, nor any evidence he'd been drugged or intoxicated or that his body had been moved.If Foster had been murdered or if unanswered questions about his death remained, Starr would have been the last person to want to conclude the investigation prematurely. Or are we to believe Kenneth Starr is part of the cover-up, too? And if we buy into this conspiracy theory, what are we expected to believe? That a group of professional killers capable of furtively carrying out dozens of murders all over the world shot Vince Foster, then clumsily dumped him in a park (after he had bled out), planted a gun he didn't own in his hand (without bothering to press his fingerprints onto it), amateurishly forged a suicide note (in several different handwritings), then expected the nation would believe his death was a suicide?:3. C. Victor Raiser, II - former National Finance Co-Chairman of Clinton for President, and Montgomery Raiser, his son. Both died in a suspicious private plane crash in Alaska. No cause determined. Raiser was considered to be a major player on the Clinton team.All plane crashes are ""suspicious,"" because airplanes are supposed to stay in the air, and when they don't it's because something went terribly wrong. Pilot error and mechanical failure are by far the most common causes underlying any crash. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigates every downed plane in the U.S., and though they might not always pin down the exact cause of a crash, they're generally pretty good about ruling out the use of explosives or mechanical tampering. If the NTSB doesn't find evidence of tampering or explosives, then that's not what downed the plane, and we're left with pilot error and mechanical failure as our choices.Raiser, his son, and three others died in a plane crash in Alaska on 30 July 1992 during a fishing trip. The pilot and another passenger survived and were hospitalized with severe burns. While the ""body count"" list claims ""no cause determined,"" the NTSB reported otherwise: pilot error in a small plane flying in mountainous terrain during low visibility conditions led to the crash.:4. Paul Tully -- DNC Political Director, was found dead in a Little Rock hotel room. No cause was ever determined and no autopsy was allowed. Tully was a key member of the damage control squad and came up with some of the Clinton strategies.Paul Tully died on 24 September 1992. Problem is, there wasn't anything the least bit unusual about his death, so whoever cooked up this list had to lie and claim that ""no cause was ever determined"" and ""no autopsy was allowed."" However, an autopsy was performed, and Tully's cause of death was determined: a massive heart attack. (Not a surprising demise, given that Tully was extremely overweight, a heavy drinker, and a chain smoker.) According to Steve Nawojczyk, the Pulaski County coroner, ""An autopsy by the Arkansas medical examiner's office discovered advanced coronary artery disease."" He added that investigators found no evidence of external trauma to the body.Note again that the conspiracy buffs offer no putative reason for Tully's ""killing"" and would have us believe that Clinton ordered his chief strategist rubbed out while the most important election of his career was a little over a month away.:5. Ed Willey -- Clinton fund raiser. Found in the woods in Virginia with a gunshot wound to the head. Ruled a suicide.Ed Willey was a former Virginia state senator and a lawyer; his wife Kathleen was active in Democratic state politics, worked as a volunteer (including some fund-raising efforts) on behalf of the Clinton campaign in Virginia in 1992, and later served as a volunteer in the White House Social Office. Ed Willey's death was as clear cut a case of suicide as one is likely to find: he was a desperate, unstable man who (along with his wife) spent money lavishly, stole $275,000 of a client's money, and was about half a million dollars in debt to the IRS. He took his own life on 29 November 1993, leaving behind a suicide note found by his wife reading: ""Saying I'm sorry doesn't begin to explain. I hope one day you will forgive me.""At the same time as Willey was killing himself, his wife was allegedly being groped by Bill Clinton. She said she'd gone to the Chief Executive looking for a job to help her family out of its financial crisis and found herself fending off his advances. Clinton admitted to the meeting but denied her version of what took place. Kathleen Willey testified in Paula Jones' sexual harrassment suit against Clinton, but she never claimed that Clinton had her husband killed.:6. Hershell Friday -- Clinton fund-raiser. His plane exploded.Herschel Friday, an Arkansas lawyer who had been on the Clinton presidential campaign finance committee, died in a airplane accident on 1 March 1994. His plane did not ""explode""; this accident was another case of pilot error that occurred when the 73-year-old Friday, at the plane's controls, crashed it during an attempted landing on a poorly-lighted private airfield at dusk on a dark and drizzly day.7. Jerry Parks -- former security team member for Governor Clinton. Prior to his death he had compiled an extensive file on Clinton's activities. His family had reported being followed and his home broken into just before being gunned down at a deserted intersection.On 26 September 1993, Luther (Jerry) Parks was hit with ten bullets from a 9-mm semiautomatic handgun as he left a Mexican restaurant at the edge of Little Rock. His murder remains unsolved.:Parks' security company guarded Clinton's campaign headquarters in 1992. Parks' son, Gary, asserted in Circle of Power and The Clinton Chronicles (both video products of Linda Thompson's American Justice Federation) that his father collected a secret file of Clinton's indiscretions, and that his father was using the file to try to blackmail the Clinton campaign. (He also claimed that Vince Foster knew of the file's existence.) Despite these allegations, the younger Parks never produced the mysterious file, and Clyde Steelman, a homicide sergeant with the Little Rock police force, dismissed Gary Parks' theories of his father's death as ""unsubstantiated, nothing to grasp."" A far more likely suspect in the murder was Jerry Parks' former partner, with whom Parks had quarreled bitterly.8. John Wilson -- former Washington D.C. council member. Had ties to Whitewater. Died of a very suspicious hanging suicide.John Wilson was the chairman of the District of Columbia Council, and his suicide was far from ""very suspicious"": Wilson had a long history of depression, was wrestling with marital problems, and had tried to kill himself on at least four other occasions. He finally succeeded on 19 May 1993. Upon his death, Wilson's wife said, ""[His] depression was an inherited problem; that he was able to contribute so much over the years in the face of his disability was a miracle."" Police said that he did not leave a note and that there were no signs of foul play.:Wilson had absolutely nothing in common with Clinton other than that they worked in the same city (i.e., Washington, D.C.). The claim that Wilson had anything to do with the Whitewater real estate controversy is laughable.9. Kathy Ferguson -- former wife of Arkansas State Trooper Danny Ferguson, the co-defendant with Bill Clinton in the Paula Jones lawsuit. Found dead in her living room of a gunshot wound to the head. Ruled a suicide. Interestingly, her packed suitcases seemed to indicate she was about to go somewhere.Kathy Ferguson killed herself with a gunshot to the right temple on 11 May 1994 at the home of her boyfriend, Bill Shelton. Their relationship had fallen on hard times, with each accusing the other of having been unfaithful. Ferguson left behind a suicide note that read: ""I can't stay here any longer. Things will never be the same for us. I can't take that."" Close by was another note from Shelton questioning her relationship with another man, which Ferguson's daughter said her mother had been upset over.We found no mention of packed suitcases in any of the reports about Ferguson's death, but even if there were, it wouldn't be the least bit surprising. Is it so unusual that a woman might be thinking of moving out of the house of a boyfriend who had quarreled with her and challenged her fidelity?:10. Bill Shelton -- Arkansas state trooper and fiance of Kathy Ferguson. Allegedly committed suicide by shooting himself at her grave.Shelton killed himself over Kathy Ferguson's grave on 12 June 1994, leaving a suicide note that was found beside his body. Just a month earlier he had quarreled with his girlfriend, accused her of cheating on him, and driven her to suicide. There was nothing mysterious about his death or his reasons for taking his life. And if the idea that the ex-wife of an Arkansas state trooper constitutes a Clinton ""connection"" weren't absurd enough, we're now offered the boyfriend of an ex-wife of an Arkansas state trooper.11. Gandy Baugh -- attorney for Dan Lasater in a financial misconduct case. Supposedly jumped out the window of a tall building to commit suicide.News accounts stated that Gandy Baugh died ""at home"" on 8 January 1994 without specifying the causes. ""Died at home"" is a euphemism often employed in news articles and obituaries to avoid a direct mention of suicide, but we haven't found any definitive information about how Baugh died.:12. Dr. Donald Rogers -- dentist. Killed in a suspicious plane crash on his way to an interview with reporter Ambrose Evans-Pritchard to reveal information about Clinton.On 3 March 1994, the Cessna plane carrying a pilot, dentist, Donald Rogers, and two other passengers crashed. The pilot had earlier radioed in that he was experiencing electrical trouble and then lost radio contact. The NTSB's investigation of the crash found nothing ""mysterious"" about it: the plane's left generator had severely overheated and shut down, leaving the plane without electrical systems; the plane went down far off its planned route, and the pilot was good and lost at the time of the crash.No amount of digging has disclosed why a dentist would have such revelatory information about the President of the United States that a plane crash had to be arranged to bump him off.13. Stanley Huggins -- lawyer investigating Madison Guaranty. Suicide. His extensive report has never been released.:How anyone can confuse dying of pneumonia with suicide is beyond us. Huggins died on 23 June 1994, and according Dr. Richard Callery, Delaware's top medical examiner, viral myocarditis and bronchial pneumonia killed Huggins. Lt. Joel Ivory of the University of Delaware police said his exhaustive investigation of Huggins's death turned up ""no sign at all of foul play.""14. Florence Martin -- Accountant for the CIA and had information on the Barry Seal case. Three gunshot wounds to the head.On 23 October 1994, 69-year-old Florence Martin of Mabelle, Texas (40 miles from Wichita Falls), was murdered in her home by three gunshots to the head through a pillow. She wasn't an accountant for the CIA, though: She worked the graveyard shift at a convenience store in nearby Seymour and had lived in that area for decades.In 2012, Jack Wesley Melton was charged with Martin's murder. DNA found at the scene was matched to him, leading to his arrest.:15. Suzane Coleman -- reportedly had an affair with Clinton. Was seven months pregnant at the time she was found dead of a gun shot wound to the back of the head, ruled suicide.At the time of Susan Coleman's suicide, Bill Clinton was her law professor. In 1992 an overzealous supporter of George Bush hired investigators to probe this girl's 1977 suicide, and they found no evidence that she and Clinton had an affair. It was an old rumor and a baseless one, and even a determined attempt at muckraking turned up nothing to substantiate it.16. Paula Grober -- Clinton's interpreter for the deaf. Traveled with Clinton from 1978 until her death in 1992 in a one-car accident. There were no witnesses.The accident that killed Paula Gober took place during the afternoon of 7 December 1992. Her car overturned at a curve in the highway, throwing her 33 feet from the vehicle. No one witnessed the accident. And again, no one has provided any explanation for what secrets about Clinton an interpreter might possess that would merit her murder.17. Paul Wilcher -- attorney investigating corruption. He had investigated federal elections, drug and gun smuggling through Mena, the Waco incident, and had just delivered a lengthy report to Janet Reno. He died in his home of unknown causes.Wilcher's partially decomposed body was found seated on the toilet in his Washington, D.C., home on 22 June 1993, and his death was attributed to natural causes. According to the Washington Times, Wilcher ""was investigating the theory of an 'October Surprise' conspiracy during the 1980 federal election campaign. He had been interviewing an inmate who claimed to have piloted George Bush to Paris so he could secretly seek to delay the release of 52 American hostages in Iran."" President Clinton, just a year into his first term, would hardly be likely to give up a key political advantage by bumping off someone who was supposedly about to dig up some major dirt on the opposition party18. Jon Parnell Walker -- RTC investigator who mysteriously fell to his death from an apartment balcony.We have turned up no information about this man, not a report of his death nor of his being an Resolution Trust Corporation investigator. Various versions of this list state that his death took place on 15 August 1993 at the Lincoln Towers in Arlington, Virginia, but we've found no documentation of that.19. Ron Brown -- former DNS Chairman, Commerce Secretary. Reported to have died in a plane crash, but new evidence reveals he may have been shot in the head. He was being investigated by a special investigator and was about to be indicted with 54 others. He spoke publicly of his willingness to ""make a deal"" with the prosecutors to save himself a few days before the fatal trip. He was not supposed to be on the flight but was asked to go at the last minute. (This count does not include the other business leaders and other passengers who died on this government-sponsored trade mission.)What ""new evidence""? Ron Brown and 34 others were killed in a plane crash in Croatia on 3 April 1996. The plane slammed into a mountain while on landing approach. There were no survivors.Much has been made of an x-ray of Brown's skull showing what supposedly looks like a round entry wound. Closer examination of Brown's skull by military officials revealed no bullet, no bone fragments, no metal fragments and, even more telling, no exit wound. Simply imagining a scenario under which Ron Brown could have been shot takes one into the realm of the absurd. Was he shot in the head during the flight, in full view of thirty-four other witnesses? (If so, how did the shooters get off the plane?) Did the killers shoot him before the flight, then bundle his body into a seat (just like Weekend at Bernie's) and hope nobody noticed the gaping hole in his head? Or did Croatian commandos fortuitously appear on the scene to scale a mountain and pump a bullet into the head of an already-dead plane crash victim?An exhaustive Air Force investigation of the crash found that pilot error was to blame:The aircrew made errors while planning and executing the mishap flight, which, when combined, were a cause of the mishap. During mission planning, the crew's review of the Dubrovnik approach failed to determine that it required two automatic direction finders, or ADFs, and that it could not be flown with the single ADF onboard their aircraft. Additionally, the crew improperly flight planned their route which added 15 minutes to their flight time. The pilots rushed their approach and did not properly configure the aircraft for landing prior to commencing the final segment of the approach. They crossed the final approach fix flying at 80 knots above final approach speed, and without clearance from the tower.As a result of the rushed approach, the late configuration, and a radio call from a pilot on the ground, the crew was distracted from adequately monitoring the final approach. The pilots flew a course 9 degrees left of the correct course. They also failed to identify the missed approach point and to execute a timely missed approach.20. Barbara Wise -- Commerce Department secretary. Worked with Ron Brown and John Huang and had extensive knowledge of their activities. Found dead in her locked office the day after Thanksgiving. It was ruled a suicide. Interestingly, she was found partially clothed, bruised, and in a pool of blood.There was no pool of blood, and Barbara Wise's death was never ruled a suicide by anyone. She was discovered in her Commerce Department office on 29 November 1996 after having last been seen alive on 27 November 1996, the day before Thanksgiving. A thorough investigation uncovered no evidence of foul play or suicide. Wise had a history of frequent and severe health problems, including liver ailments, and her death was attributed to natural causes.21. Charles Meissner -- Assistant Secretary of Commerce. John Huang was given a special security clearance by Meissner. Shortly thereafter, he died in the crash of a small plane.Charles Meissner died in the same plane crash that took the life of Ron Brown, the one in Croatia on 3 April 1996. Fourteen Commerce Department staffers died in that crash, Meissner and Brown among them.We're now entering an long segment of the list wherein a number of deaths are tied to those of Don Henry and Kevin Ives, who were supposedly linked to Bill Clinton. All of this linkage is one big canard: Henry and Ives had nothing to do with Clinton; they were two young men who foolishly ripped off drugs from a dealer and were beaten to death in revenge. With no link between Clinton and Henry or Ives, the following eight entries collapse like a house of cards.22 & 23. Kevin Ives and Don Henry -- seventeen-year-old boys who apparently saw something related to drugs in Mena by accident late at night. Officially ruled an accidental death on the train tracks, but evidence shows they died before being placed on the tracks -- one of a crushed skull and the other of a knife wound in the back.Henry and Ives were run over by a train on 23 Aug 1987. Dr. Fahmy Malak, Arkansas' former state medical examiner, ruled the deaths accidental, saying the teens fell asleep on the tracks after smoking marijuana. A 1988 Saline County grand jury determined the boys were murdered and their bodies afterwards laid on the tracks, but no other conclusions were reached and no indictments were returned.A number of Malak's determinations had been challenged and overturned during his career. He certainly wasn't always a conscientious medical examiner, and his Ives and Henry rulings were only two of many such he botched.Getting back to the real meat of who killed the boys, we find nothing that ties Ives and Henry to Clinton. Though various of these lists will claim the boys accidentally stumbled onto a ""protected"" drug drop and were killed for it, there's no reason to believe even that. In a 25 May 1990 hearing before U.S. Magistrate Henry Jones Jr., Katherine Brightop said her ex-boyfriend Paul William Criswell told her that he and three other men were involved in the teenagers' deaths. Brightop said Criswell told her the boys tried to steal cocaine from Callaway's home and they were caught and beaten to death before their bodies were placed on the tracks.24. Keith Koney -- had information on the Ives and Henry deaths. Died in a motorcycle accident with reports of a high-speed car chased involved.19-year-old Keith Coney died on 17 May 1988 when the motorcycle he was driving struck the back of a tractor-trailer. He was riding a motorcycle he'd stolen the day before. There were no reports of a high-speed car chase involved in his fatal traffic accident.25. Keith McKaskle -- had information on the Ives and Henry deaths. Stabbed to death.In August 1989, Ronald Shane Smith was sentenced to ten years for the 10 November 1988 murder of Keith McKaskle. McKaskle had earlier expressed fears for his life, linking them to his knowing something about ""the railroad track thing"". Smith may have been paid to kill McKaskle, as a prison inmate said he had been approached and offered $4,000 to kill McKaskle himself.26. Gregory Collins -- had information on the Ives and Henry deaths. Gunshot wound to the head.Greg Collins (25) of Bryant, Arkansas, was found shot in woods near Rosston on 2 December 1989. If he truly knew something about drug-related murders, that's reason enough for him to have been killed without any connection to Bill Clinton.27. Jeff Rhodes -- had information on the Ives and Henry and McKaskle deaths. Tortured, mutilated, shot, body burned in a dumpster.In July 1989 Frank Pilcher was arrested for the April 1989 murder of Jeffrey Rhodes. Rhodes had earlier told his father he feared for his life because he'd witnessed a narcotics transaction.Rhodes was last seen alive on April 3. His body was discovered in a dumpster on April 19. He'd been shot twice in the head and his body was badly burned. The body was likely burned in an effort to destroy forensic evidence that would led investigators to the murderer.28. James Milam -- had information on the Ives and Henry deaths. He was decapitated. The coroner ruled death due to natural causes.This is my favorite entry. Remember that Arkansas medical examiner, the one I said wasn't always the most conscientious investigator on God's green earth? Yep, we're about to see him again. Fahmy Malak listed James Milam's cause of death as a perforated ulcer, adding that Milam's small dog afterwards ate the dead man's head, accounting for Milam's headless condition.Milam's daughter-in-law insisted Milam was murdered. She claimed Malak showed her photographs of the headless corpse, and the neck was cut clean. The Milam family has not attempted to legally challenge the ruling because of the expense, so we'll never know which way the cat jumps, ulcer or murder.Whatever killed him, Milam died three months before the Ives and Henry murders. What are we supposed to believe here, that Clinton conspirators knocked off someone who ""had information on the Ives and Henry deaths"" three months before Ives and Henry actually died? Wow, talk about a preemptive strike!29. Jordan Kettleson -- had information on the Ives and Henry deaths. Found shot in the front seat of his pick up truck.21-year-old Jordan Ketelsen died on 25 June 1990.30. Dr. Stanley Heard -- Chair, National Chiropractic Health Care Advisory Committee. He personally treated Clinton's mother, stepfather, and brother. His personal small plane developed problems so he rented another. Fire broke out in flight and he crashed.Stanley Heard and Stephen Dickson died on 10 September 1993, when their Piper Turbo Lance II caught fire shortly after takeoff from Dulles airport and crashed. They'd attended a briefing that morning on the Clinton administration's health care plan. Dickson's plane had developed mechanical problems on the way to Washington the week before, so Dickson and Heard rented the Cherokee in St. Louis to make the trip. They rented a badly maintained plane, and it cost them their lives.Here is what the NTSB had to say about this crash.I've found nothing on the National Chiropractic Health Care Advisory that Heard supposedly chaired.31. Steve Dickson -- attorney for Heard. Died in same plane crash.Dickson attended the same briefing Heard did. We do not know if he was there as Heard's lawyer or for independent reasons.32. John Hillier -- video journalist and investigator. He helped to produce the documentaries ""Circle of Power,"" and ""The Clinton Chronicles."" He mysteriously died in a dentist's chair for no apparent reason.Again, we could find no record of this man's death or of his work. There have been a few dental chair deaths, but we turned up nothing on this one.33. Maj. Gen. William Robertson34. Col. William Densberger35. Col. Robert Kelly36. Spec. Gary Rhodes37. Steve Willis38. Robert Williams39. Conway LeBleu40. Todd McKeehan41. Sgt. Brian Haney42. Sgt. Tim Sabel43. Maj.William Barkley44. Capt. Scott Reynolds* all former Clinton bodyguards who are dead.Steve Willis, Robert Williams, Todd McKeehan, and Conway LeBleu were Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents killed during the Waco confrontation on 28 February 1993.Brian Haney, Timothy Sabel, William Barkley, and Scott Reynolds died in a helicopter crash on 19 May 1993. These four were members of Marine Helicopter Squadron One, the unit responsible for transporting the President. They died when the Blackhawk helicopter they had taken out for a maintenance-evaluation flight crashed. There was no evidence of sabotage. Clinton had set foot in the aircraft on only one occasion, two months earlier, when he traveled from the White House to the USS Theodore Roosevelt.Jarrett Robertson, William Densberger, Robert Kelly, and Gary Rhodes all died on 23 February 1993 when their Army UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter crashed on landing in Weisbaden, Germany. A jury later found that the pilots were not at fault, but that the helicopter ""entered into an uncontrollable right turn caused by a design defect.""45. Gary Johnson -- former attorney for Larry Nichols, severely beaten and left for dead.Again, we could find nothing on this incident or even this man's life.46. Dennis Patrick -- had millions of dollars laundered through his account at Lasater & Co. without his knowledge. There have been several attempts on his life, all unsuccessful.It's hard to know what to say about this one. Though we found credible reference to Patrick's life having been in danger a few times, we were unable to trace back to news reports on the original incidents. Without seeing them, we're not confident in stating an opinion on whether or not those attempts took place.Patrick was a client of Lasater, albeit a reluctant one. He was asked to open an account there, he refused, one was opened for him anyway, and he was handed ""profits"" from one transaction for his part in allowing whatever was going on to take place. Again, someone who got involved with drug dealers ended up in trouble. In this case, an otherwise upstanding man took money he knew to be dirty to keep quiet about what his account was being used for. If was subsequently chased by drug dealers who didn't want the details of the transactions to come to light, was that all that surprising?47. L.J. Davis -- reporter. While investigating the Clinton scandals he was attacked in his hotel room and his notes were taken. He survived.Davis said he had awakened in his hotel room with a big bump on his head. He soon admitted having drunk at least four martinis that night. No pages were missing from his notebook, and he had no idea how he ended up on the floor. ""I certainly wasn't about to conclude that somebody cracked me on the head,"" Davis said at the time.48. Larry Nichols -- former marketing director of ADFA. Responsible for bringing forth more evidence and witnesses on Clinton corruption than any other source. Very public about his claims against Clinton. He has suffered six beatings, arrest on trumped up charges, and a near arrest.In 1988 Larry Nichols, then a marketing director for the Arkansas Development Finance Authority, was fired from his job for making hundreds of calls to the Nicaraguan contras from his office. In 1990 he filed a lawsuit against Clinton claiming the then-Governor of Arkansas and others made him the scapegoat in a misappropriation-of-funds charge that cost him his job. In that suit he also tossed in claims of extramarital affairs, naming five women Clinton was supposed to have chased across the sheets. Nichols withdrew his lawsuit in 1992 and issued a round of apologies to everyone involved. He admitted what he'd said had been an attempt to destroy the Governor by innuendo.Nichols has since changed his tune yet again, and has returned to making allegations against Clinton, always being careful to stop just short of asserting Clinton is involved in various murders and other crimes Nichols points to as ""suspicious.""Since his dismissal from the AFDA, Nichols has made a career of peddling anti-Clinton books and tapes to the lunatic fringe. Take anything claimed about or by this man with a huge grain of salt.Now, ask yourself: how many people with whom you were acquainted have died mysteriously or violently in the past 10 years.The bottom line on this piece of e-lore? It's a badly worked laundry list dressed up to appear significant. The promised damning connections to the Chief Executive are missing, with innuendo misinformation offered up in their place. Nothing ties Clinton to any of these deaths, something this list (and others of its ilk) conveniently glosses over. What evidence is offered that would compel a rational person to believe there was Clinton involvement in any of these deaths?Clinton was acquainted with some people who died -- that's about all one can make of this list. Indeed, that's far more than can be made of a number of the entries, specifically, that of Ives and Henry and all those supposedly tied to theirs.Though it's clear from digging through numerous newspaper articles there was a thriving and dangerous drug culture in Little Rock, how or why this should be connected to Bill Clinton is left unanswered. Regrettably, Little Rock is akin to numerous other large cities: it has its share of drug dealers, murders, and violence. It also has one very famous citizen. And that's about as much of a connection as anyone can make.Whereas a typical private citizen has a much smaller circle of acquaintance, those in public office come into contact with a great many people over the course of their careers. It is therefore not unusual to find at least a few accidental deaths, homicides, and suicides among any politician's list of contacts. (For example, a ""body count"" list exists for George Bush.)A number of suicides are enumerated in this list. Suicide is far from an unusual mode of demise. It claims 32,000 lives in the U.S. every year, and it's the 9th leading cause of death. It is indeed a rare person who does not know someone who died by his own hand.Deaths by airplane crash account for a number of entries on the list. Again, this is not all that surprising. Every year many small planes crash in the United States, and some of those crashes result in fatalities. As mentioned above, the National Transportation Safety Board investigates every one of them, to determine both the cause of the accident as well as to gather data that will help prevent future tragedies. The agency does a thorough job of looking into the circumstances surrounding each downed plane. To describe any of the plane crash deaths on this list as ""suspicious"" is to suggest the NTSB was part of a coverup.There have been a couple of unsolved murders (Jerry Parks, Kevin Ives, and Don Henry), but there have also been deaths by natural causes that have been tossed into the mix willy-nilly simply to boost the body count. (As we said earlier, how can anyone claim a death by pneumonia was a suicide?) All the best lies make sure to mix a bit of truth in with them, and the few genuinely unsolved murders work to cloak the many less credible claims in an aura of plausibility. Don't be overly bemused by them -- study each entry on its own merits.One final question to ask yourself before falling for any Clinton Body Count list: If the Chief Executive was having people bumped off left, right, and center, why aren't Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp on this list? At the time of Mary Mahoney's death -- a death this list hints was ordered by Clinton -- neither Tripp nor Lewinsky were the high-profile household names they now are; they were complete unknowns. It would be another six months before information about them would explode into the news. If the President were in the habit of having those dangerous to his presidency put in the ground, why didn't he order these deaths?The August 2019 in-custody death by suicide of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein triggered a new round of attempts to connect the Clintons with a murder plot conspiracy."
692,692,152.DidChelseaClintonTwe,"Claim:Hillary Clinton's daughter Chelsea ""admitted"" in a tweet that the Pizzagate conspiracy is ""real.""Rating:FalseAbout this rating In June 2018, multiple disreputable web sites pushed false reports about the alleged discovery of a ""child trafficking bunker"" near Tucson, Arizona.  Many of those same sites also attempted to assert some putative connection between Hillary Clinton and the debunked bunker site, as well as with child sex trafficking in general.:This onslaught of misinformation prompted Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, to issue a tweet likening the phenomenon to the absurd and thoroughly debunked ""Pizzagate conspiracy theory of November 2016 (which held that Hillary Clinton and others were running a child trafficking ring out of a Washington, D.C., pizzeria) and pointing followers to the National Human Trafficking Hotline as a responsible source for dealing with child trafficking reports:Of course there's a #Pizzagate 2.0. Of course there is. If you have been a victim of trafficking or have suspicions of actual trafficking, please reach out to the National Human Trafficking Hotline: 1-888-373-7888. https://t.co/6IpshzA8Vv-- Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) June 6, 2018The disreputable Neon Nettle web site then published an article bizarrely claiming that Chelsea Clinton's tweet constituted an ""admission"" that Pizzagate was ""real"" and that the National Human Trafficking Hotline was actually ""run"" by her mother::Daughter of the former secretary of state Hillary Clinton has seemingly admitted that 'Pizzagate' -- the conspiracy theory born out of the Wikileaks emails allegedly exposing politicians running pedophile rings - is real on her Twitter. In a strange rant, Chelsea Clinton Tweeted ""of course there's a #Pizzagate 2.0. Of course, there is,"" in a sarcastic reference to the recent child trafficking bust in Arizona. Not long after the Tweet was sent out, Twitter users discovered that National Human Trafficking Hotline that Chelsea mentioned in her Tweet is actually the organization run by her mother Hillary, one of the many high profile people accused of being involved in the child sex ring in Washington D.C.All of this was false: Chelsea Clinton's tweet was neither ""strange"" nor a ""rant,"" nor did she literally tweet that 'Pizzagate is real' (or anything else that could rationally be construed as an admission of such) -- Ms. Clinton was clearly referencing and expressing dismay at her mother's name being dragged into yet another preposterous child trafficking rumor.  Moreover, Hillary Clinton does not ""run"" the human trafficking hotline her daughter tweeted about, as its parent organization's chief communications officer, Caren Benjamin, told us::The National Human Trafficking Hotline is operated by Polaris, a nonpartisan, non-profit, non-governmental organization that is a leader in the global fight to eradicate modern slavery and restore freedom to survivors of human trafficking. We are not a government, law enforcement, or immigration [entity].  Funding is provided by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other private donors and supporters. [W]e have no relationships with, or to, any of the Clintons."
693,693,147.NoTikTokVideoDoesntS,"Claim:A TikTok video shows a clip of a Joe Biden body ""double"" carrying his own handbags to a car.Rating:FalseAbout this rating Fact CheckIt's back. The ridiculous ""body double"" conspiracy theory that once targeted then-first lady Melania Trump was targeting U.S. President Joe Biden in late spring 2022.:A widely viewed TikTok video, posted in early June 2022, showed Biden carrying two handbags to an SUV. The video was captioned, ""No comment (double)!?"" :Notably, the above video clip doesn't contain any descriptions about the time, place, or circumstances under which it was shot. Although it doesn't state outright why the man in the video is supposed to be a Biden ""double,"" the implication appears to be that Biden, as president, wouldn't carry his own luggage.But the explanation may be a rather simple one: The video was taken during an earlier period of time, likely before Biden was president. He appears to be slightly younger in the video than he is now.This isn't the first time the Biden body-double claim has been made.For example, in 2020, Snopes debunked a claim based on false allegations that Biden's earlobes in various images and videos were different, proving he must have been cloned or using a body double.In similar past claims, social media users posted a digitally altered image to falsely accuse Biden of using a body double to get a COVID-19 booster shot. Others confused a lighting effect to mean that Biden's skin tone didn't match his natural coloring, falsely alleging a body double stood in for him during a television interview.:As noted above, false claims that Melania Trump used a body double became so persistent that her husband, then-President Donald Trump, addressed it -- in the process launching his own conspiracy theory.Taking to his now permanently suspended Twitter account, Trump stated:""The Fake News photoshopped pictures of Melania, then propelled conspiracy theories that it's actually not her by my side in Alabama and other places,"" the president tweeted. ""They are only getting more deranged with time."""
694,694,143.IsWayfairTrafficking,"Claim:The furniture store Wayfair is trafficking children via overpriced items. Rating:FalseAbout this rating In July 2020, some social media users accused the furniture store Wayfair of trafficking children. This gravely serious accusation was not based on police reports, firsthand accounts, financial records, or deep investigative reporting. Rather, it was based on the fact that some items on Wayfair were listed at exorbitant prices compared to other, similar items.:This rumor appears to have originated on the ""conspiracy"" section of Reddit on July 9, 2020. That post noted that Wayfair was selling utility closets from WFX that were priced at more than $10,000, and offered child trafficking as a possible explanation. That post, like so many other conspiracy theories, offered this notion as a mere possibility and said that it would be stomach churning ""if ... true."" Is it possible Wayfair involved in Human trafficking with their WFX Utility collection? Or are these just extremely overpriced cabinets? (Note the names of the cabinets) this makes me sick to my stomach if it's true :(This post led to other users combing the Wayfair website in search of other oddities. One Twitter user, for instance, found a set of pillows and shower curtains that were listed for $9,999. As similar items on the website were listed for only $99, this person assumed that the only logical explanation was that the higher priced item was being used to traffic children.The Twitter user wrote::If you search bungalow rose a bunch of shower curtains and pillows show up priced at $9,999. Wayfair is fucking trafficking children what the FUCKSame with other things. They all have big price jumps to like 10 grand. Wayfair also supplies the furniture at ICE detention centers, where children are going MISSING fromGenerally speaking, the images showing expensive cabinets and large price differentials on pillows, shower curtains, and other items on Wayfair's website are real. However, it takes quite a leap in logic to arrive at the conclusion that this is evidence that the store is engaged in child trafficking.In fact, the more we pondered this claim, the more nonsensical it appeared. Would a large business really use their official website to allow people to purchase children online? As these items are available to anyone with internet access, wouldn't it be possible for someone to accidentally become involved in child trafficking? Why would a child trafficking operation use a method that would be so easy to track? :This claim is largely based on the idea that $10,000 is simply too expensive for a cabinet, and that there has to be some other explanation -- child trafficking -- to justify its cost. In a statement to Newsweek, however, Wayfair noted that these were industrial grade cabinets, and that they had been accurately priced. Wayfair said that they temporarily removed these items, as the accompanying descriptions did not accurately explain the reason for the price point.Wayfair told Newsweek in a statement:""There is, of course, no truth to these claims. The products in question are industrial grade cabinets that are accurately priced. Recognizing that the photos and descriptions provided by the supplier did not adequately explain the high price point, we have temporarily removed the products from site to rename them and to provide a more in-depth description and photos that accurately depict the product to clarify the price point.""We reached out to Wayfair for more information about the expensive pillows and shower curtains, but have yet to receive a response. :As this rumor circulated on social media, people chimed in with additional ""evidence"" of Wayfair's supposedly nefarious activities. For instance, some claimed that searching for the stock keeping unit number (SKU) associated with these items preceded by the term ""src usa"" on the Russian search engine Yandex returned images of young female children. This is, bizarrely, true. However, searching for just about any random string of numbers preceded by the ""src usa"" returns similar results. It's possible that these search results are connected to the Russian image hosting website ""Imgsrc,"" which has previously hosted child pornography images. We reached out to Yandex for more information about these search results, and will update this article accordingly.Others claimed that these products carried the names of children who had gone missing. One cabinet, for instance, appeared on Wayfair as the ""Anabel 5-shelf storage unit."" This, according to proponents of this theory, corresponded with an Anabel Wilson who had gone missing in Kansas. While this may seem suspicious to those seeking a pattern, it should be noted that there were more than 400,000 entries for missing juveniles in the FBI's National Crime Information Center in 2019. In other words, the fact that some of these product names were the same as the first names of children who had gone missing could easily be nothing more than a coincidence.:Furthermore, some of the missing children cases this theory attempted to connect to Wayfair have already been solved. The ""Alyvia"" shelf, for example, was supposedly connected to Alyvia Navarro. This autistic child went missing at the age of 3 in 2013 and, unfortunately, was found dead shortly after she went missing, having drowned in a nearby pond. On July 13, 2020, proponents of this theory started sharing a mugshot of a man in a Wayfair shirt and claimed that he had recently been arrested as part of a trafficking ring.:This is a genuine photograph of Fredrick Walker Jr. who was arrested on June 21, 2020, during a prostitution sting in Barnesville, Georgia. However, those sharing this image as ""proof"" of this Wayfair conspiracy theory failed to mention that this person was just one of nearly two dozen people who were arrested during this sting, that none of the other people arrested were wearing Wayfair shirts, that news reports about the arrest made no mention about any connection to the store, and that there's no evidence that the victims in this case were children. The claim that Wayfair is trafficking children is based almost entirely on one person's confusion over an expensive cabinet. This conspiracy theory, like so many conspiracy theories, started with a wild and unfounded assumption that would be sickening if it were actually true. As of this writing, absolutely no credible evidence has been offered to back up this accusation. But the conspiracy theory did have real impact. According to a July 20 press release from Polaris, its National Human Trafficking Hotline (1-888-373-7888) received such an ""extreme volume"" of reports related to this rumor (none of which contained information beyond what was already reported online) that it struggled to respond to other calls from people potentially in need. The statement encouraged callers to learn more about ""what human trafficking really looks like."":"

Marjorie Taylor Greene a cease-and-desist letter over the use of one of his recordings in a tweeted video.Rating:TrueAbout this rating ""It's time to begin.. and they can't stop what's coming,"" U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, wrote in a Jan. 9, 2023, tweet containing a video reportedly showing her walking to the House floor, a mundane activity no doubt made cooler by the fact that the iconic 1990s rap song ""Still D.R.E."" accompanied it.:Within hours though, the video in Greene's tweet had been spiked, and a message reading, ""This media has been disabled in response to a report by the copyright owner,"" replaced it.Greene's post appeared to be a political promotion for the newly-sworn in GOP majority in the House, which took a slim edge in the 2022 midterm election. But rapper Dr. Dre, whose real name is Andre Young, was very much not on board with it, as the cease-and-desist letter sent to Greene by his attorney stated in unambiguous terms.He ""has not, and will never, grant you permission to broadcast or disseminate any of his music,"" Dre's attorney Howard King wrote, due to what he described as Greene's ""divisive and hateful political agenda.""The letter was obtained by celebrity news site TMZ, which posted it online in full. King's office confirmed in an email to Snopes that the letter shared by TMZ and multiple news sources is authentic. It also contained a statement from Dr. Dre himself::""I don't license my music to politicians, especially someone as divisive and hateful as this one.""King's letter was widely shared on social media:""One might expect that, as a member of Congress, you would have a passing familiarity with the laws of our country,"" King wrote in the letter, later adding, ""We're writing because we think an actual lawmaker should be making laws not breaking laws, especially those embodied by the constitution by the founding fathers."":It then states that Greene had violated U.S. copyright law by using Dre's song without his consent.After the video was removed, Greene told TMZ she had a problem with the song's lyrics anyway, giving the outlet a statement apparently directed at Dr. Dre: ""While I appreciate the creative chord progression, I would never play your words of violence against women and police officers, and your glorification of the thug life and drugs.""Greene has gained notoriety as one of the more extreme Republicans in Congress, after being elected to represent Georgia's 14th congressional district in 2020. She has in the past promoted various conspiracy theories, including QAnon, and in 2022 spoke at a conference led by a white nationalist. In December 2022, she was criticized for seemingly making light of the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, stating that if she had helped organize it, ""we would have won.""Greene promoted the false claims of mass-scale election fraud during the 2020 presidential election that sparked the Capitol riot.:The lyrics of the song ""Still D.R.E."" contain phrases that would be considered offensive to some, and the line, ""still not loving the police.""The song ""Still D.R.E"" remains popular years after its debut.

The far-right theory holds that global elites are actively working to ""replace"" white Europeans (or, in the United States, white Americans) with non-white immigrants and that this ""great replacement"" will conclude with the extinction of the white race.The National Immigration Forum writes: ""The 'great replacement' theory, in simple terms, states that welcoming immigration policies -- particularly those impacting nonwhite immigrants -- are part of a plot designed to undermine or ""replace"" the political power and culture of white people living in Western countries.""While the theory found its way into the mainstream in recent years, thanks in part to the rise of online communities and increasingly dangerous political rhetoric, this theory's roots go back centuries. The Southern Poverty Law Center notes that racist authors have been warning white people about their imminent demise for centuries::In 1892, British-Australian author Charles Pearson warned that one day soon, white people would ""wake to find ourselves elbowed and hustled, and perhaps even thrust aside by peoples whom we looked down upon."" His book National Life and Character launched a genre that included even more apocalyptic visions of white extinction from American authors, including the racist and antisemitic New York lawyer Madison Grant.Grant's own scientific-racist 1916 book, The Passing of the Great Race, warned of the decline and extinction of America's ""Nordic"" racial stock. (Scientific racism is the discredited, pseudoscientific belief that scientific evidence exists to support racism and racially biased state policy.) Grant did not write from the fringes: His book influenced the widespread adoption of eugenic policies, restrictions on non-white immigration and anti-miscegenation laws in the U.S. in the interwar period. (Eugenics is a debunked pseudoscience whose believers are obsessed with controlling heredity through hateful notions like ""racial hygiene"" to preserve supposedly superior races and ethnicities.)Proponents of this theory often use the word ""invasion"" to describe immigration. The phrase ""global elites"" is also frequently found in posts about the great replacement, a term that harkens back to long-standing, anti-Semitic theories about the world being secretly controlled by Jewish people. The replacement theory has taken root in white supremacist circles as it reflects their ""14 words"" rallying cry. The Anti-Defamation League writes::The ""great replacement"" philosophy was quickly adopted and promoted by the white supremacist movement, as it fit into their conspiracy theory about the impending destruction of the white race, also know as ""white genocide."" It is also a strong echo of the white supremacist rallying cry, ""the 14 words:"" ""We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.""The theory has been at the heart of several deadly incidents over the years. In May 2022, for example, the alleged shooter behind a deadly attack at a grocery store in a predominantly Black neighborhood left behind a screed that cited the Great Replacement Theory as a reason for the attack. This screed echoed (and in some case plagiarized) the text left behind by the gunman who killed 51 people in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019. Source:Feuer, Alan.

697,697,647.WereUSMarineCorpsHel,"Claim:A large contingent of U.S. Marine Corps helicopters were seen circling CIA headquarters.Rating:FalseAbout this rating A right-wing radio host is making the unsupported claim that the U.S. military ""sent a message"" to the Central Intelligence Agency by buzzing the intelligence agency's headquarters with helicopters. Hal Turner, who is also a convicted felon, says he was contacted by unnamed witnesses to a story that was being downplayed by reputable news outlets.:Turner claimed on his web site that members of a ""Marine expeditionary unit"" was spotted at the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency in Langley, Virginia on 18 November 2017.He wrote:According to persons who reside near Langley, a large contingent of Marines arrived at CIA Headquarters in tilt-rotor aircraft and when the Marines deplaned, they were armed and moved quickly into CIA Headquarters! (I did not personally witness this and am relying solely on what witnesses are telling me)Those witnesses also say that a significant number of tilt-rotor aircraft could be clearly seen circling the grounds of CIA Headquarters, parked on the grass around the building.In an update on 20 November 2017, Turner said he was told:Someone in the Pentagon/Military . . . . no one will say who . . . made a direct show of force to the CIA on Saturday. It was, for lack of a better description, the sending of a message from the military to the CIA: knock it off.:The story was picked up by other conservative web sites. But Turner also accused some of them of embellishing his witnesses' account, adding:Yes, a group of military aircraft approached and circled the CIA Headquarters in Virginia for upwards of 30 minutes on Saturday. They did NOT land and did NOT enter CIA HQ forcibly - or otherwise.We contacted both the Central Intelligence Agency and the U.S. Marine Corps seeking comment. The CIA did not comment -- but a person did answer the phone there, suggesting that the agency was still operational despite some of the claims that Turner himself has disavowed. A Marine Corps spokesperson, Major Brian Block, told us:It is not unusual for Marines aircraft to fly to locations throughout the National Capitol Region. I can say right now that a MEU, of 2,200 Marines, certainly did not land at Langley and that claim is ridiculous, as is the idea that the Marine Corps would engage in a ""show of force"" or try to ""send a message"" that way against another part of the U.S. government.:Turner also suggested that other media outlets were ignoring the story. However, we contacted two Washington D.C.-area news stations, WJLA-TV and WRC-TV, and neither station said that they had received similar reports from their own viewers, some of which would presumably work at or live near Langley, or neighboring communities.The radio host, who was convicted in August 2010 for threatening to kill three federal judges, also attempted to link the story with other conspiracy theories through another claim:The number of SEALED INDICTMENTS presently on US District Court Dockets across the United States has reached an astonishing 1800 as of Friday, November 17. These Sealed Indictments began appearing on US District Court Dockets on October 31.There have never been this many Sealed Indictments showing on federal court Dockets at the same time . . . ever.The existence of so many sealed Indictments has lead others to suggest that large groups of federal officials - perhaps including elected officials - are facing mass arrest over a number of corruption-related activities such as ""pay-to-play"" the UraniumOne conspiracy, Pedophile Rings and other criminal activities, and these troops may be needed to keep order once the high officials start being taken under arrest.:A spokesperson for the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts told us that their office does not keep statistics regarding the number of sealed indictments. Meanwhile, both the UraniumOne and Pizzagate conspiracies have been roundly debunked.Turner also operated Superstation 95, a web site that has pushed conspiracy theories concerning the mass shootings in San Bernardino and Orlando, among other topics.The Southern Poverty Law Center has described Turner as ""a white supremacist true believer who has used radio and Internet broadcasts to disseminate his hate since the 1990s."""
698,698,19.DidCDCRaiseLethalExp,"Claim:The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention increased what it considers the ""lethal exposure"" threshold of vinyl chloride, a toxic chemical released due to the February 2023 Ohio train derailment, mere days or weeks before the incident. Rating:FalseAbout this rating ContextOn Feb. 9, 2023, the CDC announced it was seeking public comment on draft updates of the toxicological profiles for four different chemicals -- cobalt, hexachlorocyclohexane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, and vinyl chloride -- all of which took months to prepare and all of which were completed, in draft form, in January 2023. The timing of the release of the draft profile updates was unconnected to the Ohio train derailment, and, contrary to rumor, the update for vinyl chloride did not drastically raise its ""lethal exposure"" level. :Major disasters often spawn conspiracy theories, and the derailment of a train carrying toxic chemicals in East Palestine, Ohio, in February 2023 proved no exception.In the aftermath of that incident, even as authorities labored to evaluate the health and environmental impacts of the release of vinyl chloride and other hazardous substances into the atmosphere, fringe news websites and social media accounts began raising alarms over the timing of what they termed a ""suspicious"" update to the toxicological profile of vinyl chloride on the website of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The premise of this conspiracy theory was that the CDC had suddenly and inexplicably, just days before the Ohio train derailment, revised the information about vinyl chloride on its website to indicate the chemical is far less toxic than previously stated. But while it's true that the CDC updated information about vinyl chloride on its website around the date of the accident, those updates did not drastically reevaluate the toxicity of vinyl chloride, nor was there anything sudden, inexplicable, or suspicious about the timing. :'I'm Not a Conspiracy Theorist, but ...'The derailment occurred on Feb. 3, 2023. To forestall a likely explosion, authorities initiated a controlled release and burn-off of the hazardous chemicals on the train on Feb. 6, which sent a massive plume of black smoke into the atmosphere. Confusion reigned in the days to follow, as local residents watched the sky, drank bottled water, and feared for their lives, while government health officials repeated assurances that they had found no evidence of dangerous levels of chemicals in the air or water. On or about Feb. 15, rumors began to spread on social media that the CDC had suddenly and unaccountably revised its guidance on what constitutes a dangerous level of vinyl chloride, and that it had done so just 11 days before the East Palestine train crash: :The claim became more specific as it made the rounds. ""The update changes the lethal exposure from 100PPM to 100,000PPM,"" said one tweet. ""What are the odds?"" :On Feb. 17, the conspiracy theory-friendly website News Punch published an article entitled ""'Inside Job': CDC Changed Toxicity Info on Vinyl Chloride Days Before Derailment.""It claimed that: The CDC edited the toxicology profile for vinyl chloride, massively increasing the lethal exposure level and removing information about how the chemical affects children, just two weeks before the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio that spewed vast quantities of the chemical into the environment. The CDC update changed the lethal exposure from 100PPM to 100,000PPM. The lethal exposure level had remained the same for 17 years before the CDC decided to update the number just prior to the derailment, where highly toxic chemicals spilled or were burned off, leaving a chemical stench in the air nearly two weeks later.[ ... ]Evie Magazine report: In January 2023, the toxicological profile for vinyl chloride was revised from the original guidelines published in the Federal Register nearly four decades ago - on April 17, 1987, to be exact. While toxicological profiles are updated occasionally, users are alarmed by the odd timing. :Let's Look at the Facts FACT: The ""edited profile"" that caused all the ruckus was a clearly labeled draft released for public comment only. On Feb. 9, 2023, the CDC added a link on its website to a draft of an updated version of its existing Toxicological Profile for Vinyl Chloride, which had been in effect since a previous update in 2006 (not four decades ago, as claimed). As noted on the access page for the updated profile, this was not a final draft. It was posted for the purpose of gathering public comment (comment period to end May 10, 2023) before completion. According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR, the CDC agency charged with assessing the toxicity of substances), toxicological profiles are peer-reviewed summaries of published findings in the scientific literature about specific chemicals of concern. ""The toxicological profiles include an examination, summary, and interpretation of available toxicological and epidemiologic information on substances."" Profiles are evaluated annually to determine whether updating is necessary. :FACT: There was nothing odd, suspicious, or sinister about the timing of this update. Three other draft toxicological profiles were released the same day. An announcement and updates related to the draft toxicological profile were posted on the CDC website on Feb. 9, six days after the East Palestine train derailment, and three days after the controlled release of vinyl chloride. The PDF file of the draft toxicological profile was created in January, mere weeks or days before the derailment occurred. Was there anything odd or uncanny about this? Quite the opposite. The vinyl chloride update was just one of four such updates announced by the CDC on the same day (Feb. 9). In each case, existing website copy was revised and a link was added to a draft profile of the relevant substance dated January 2023. According to ATSDR, toxicological profiles can take more than a year to update, so revising the profile for vinyl chloride was not a sudden, last-minute undertaking.The four simultaneous profile releases were also announced in the Feb. 9, 2023, Federal Register: :DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICESAgency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry[Docket No. ATSDR-2022-0006]Availability of Four Draft Toxicological ProfilesAGENCY: Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).ACTION: Notice with comment period.SUMMARY: The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), announces the opening of a docket to obtain comments on drafts of four updated toxicological profiles: Cobalt, Hexachlorocyclohexanes, 1,1,1-Trichloroethane, and Vinyl Chloride.DATES: Written comments must be received on or before May 10, 2023. FACT: The draft profile did not drastically increase the ""lethal exposure level"" for vinyl chloride. :We note, first, that the phrase ""lethal exposure level"" is nowhere to be found in either the existing (2006) profile or the 2023 draft profile. Nor did we find an instance wherein an exposure level deemed lethal at 100 ppm (parts per million) in 2006 was raised to 100,000 ppm in 2023. In fact, the only statement along these lines we did encounter appeared in both versions in almost identical form: 2007:Brief exposures to concentrations of vinyl chloride ranging from 100,000 to 400,000 ppm have been shown to be fatal in experimental animals such as rats (Lester et al. 1963; Mastromatteo et al. 1960; Prodan et al. 1975), guinea pigs (Mastromatteo et al. 1960; Patty et al. 1930; Prodan et al. 1975), mice (Mastromatteo et al. 1960; Prodan et al. 1975), and rabbits (Prodan et al. 1975). At these concentrations, deaths occurred within 30-60 minutes. Male mice exposed to 30,000 ppm vinyl chloride 6 hours/day for 5 days, in a dominant lethal study showed an increased mortality rate (Anderson et al. 1976). Anincreased mortality rate was also observed at much lower concentrations in maternal mice in a developmental toxicity study (John et al. 1977, 1981). In this study, maternal mice had an increased incidence of deaths following exposure to 500 ppm for 10 days during gestation. : 2023: Brief exposures to concentrations of vinyl chloride ranging from 100,000 to 400,000 ppm have been shown to be fatal in rats (Lester et al. 1963; Mastromatteo et al. 1960; Prodan etal. 1975), guinea pigs (Mastromatteo et al. 1960; Patty et al. 1930; Prodan et al. 1975), mice (Mastromatteo et al. 1960; Prodan et al. 1975), and rabbits (Prodan et al. 1975). At these concentrations, deaths occurred within 30-60 minutes. An increased mortality rate was also observed at much lowerconcentrations in maternal mice in a developmental toxicity study (John et al. 1977, 1981). In this study, mortality was observed following exposure to 500 ppm for 10 days during gestation.In short, the revised information about vinyl chloride was part of the planned release by the CDC of four draft toxicological profiles, all dated January 2023, for public comment; the proximity of that release to the date of the Ohio train derailment was coincidental; and the 2023 draft profile for vinyl chloride does not contain a dramatic increase in the level of exposure to the chemical that is considered lethal. :Snopes contacted the CDC for comment and received the following response via email, quoted here in full: Thank you for reaching out to CDC on this request.By Congressional mandate, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) produces and updates toxicological profiles (Tox Profiles) for chemical substances found on its Substance Priority List (SPL) at National Priorities List (NPL) sites. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA or Superfund), further requires that toxicological profiles be updated periodically.  ATSDR evaluates profiles annually to determine whether updating is necessary. Depending on the complexity of the chemical, the process for developing a Tox Profile can take up to a year or more. This includes multiple reviews, such as external, independent peer review followed by release for a 90-day public comment period, and incorporating any necessary changes and final publishing.ATSDR developed the initial vinyl chloride Tox Profile in 1989 and produced updates in 1993, 1997, 2006, and 2023 based on the latest information published in the scientific literature.:ATSDR has been working on an update to the Vinyl Chloride Tox Profile over the past year, and made it available for public comment on 2/9/2023 as part of its usual process and not related to the emergent situation in East Palestine. The draft Tox Profile is available for public comment until May 20, 2023. It updates the 2006 version with the most recent information.Vinyl chloride has a total of 3 minimal risk levels (MRLs), of these, only 1 (intermediate-duration inhalation) has been revised from the 2006 vinyl chloride Tox Profile as a result of new modelling information."
699,699,702.DidDonaldTrumpSayJew,"In late October 2018, just days after a gunman massacred 11 worshipers at a Pittsburgh synagogue, social media users began sharing year-old articles in which Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro recounted a conversation with President Donald Trump in which Trump had supposedly suggested anti-Semitic attacks might have been staged to make him look bad.Shapiro and dozens of state attorneys general had met with Trump at the White House on 27 February 2017 to discuss a wave of anti-Semitic crimes which included bomb threats on Jewish centers and schools and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries. Shapiro told news outlets that Trump made a statement he found ""curious,"" as reported by the Guardian:During a meeting at the White House with dozens of state attorneys general, Trump called the threats ""reprehensible"", said Shapiro, who summarized the president's remarks during a conference call with reporters.But Trump then added that ""the reverse could be true"" and that the incidents could be aimed at making ""someone else look bad"", said Shapiro, a Democrat.:We reached out to Shapiro's office for verification but received no response.A year and eight months after that report was published, a gunman opened fire inside the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, killing 11 people inside. The suspected gunman, Robert Bowers, 46, posted racist and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about a Central American migrant caravan currently making its way through southern Mexico before the shooting. Critics have blasted Trump and other Republican politicians for making public statements that encouraged similar conspiracy theories, and for fostering what they said was an environment that emboldens white supremacists to commit violent acts.The synagogue massacre was the third extremist act carried out in just a week's time. Days earlier in another suspected hate crime, a white Louisville man killed two African-American people at a Kroger's grocery store after attempting and failing to enter a black church first. One day prior, pipe bombs began arriving in the mailboxes of prominent Democratic figures, including former President Barack Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden, 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and George Soros, a billionaire philanthropist who is often the target of right wing conspiracy theories.:Right wing political and media figures, including the president himself, stated they believed or suspected the sending of the pipe bombs was a ""false flag"" event orchestrated by the victims themselves to win public sympathy and stymie Republican candidates in looming 6 November 2018 midterm elections. Cesar Sayoc, a 56-year-old Florida man, has been charged with those crimes."

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.The COVID-19 pandemic has spawned an infodemic, a vast and complicated mix of information, misinformation and disinformation.In this environment, false narratives -- the virus was ""planned,"" that it originated as a bioweapon, that COVID-19 symptoms are caused by 5G wireless communications technology -- have spread like wildfire across social media and other communication platforms. Some of these bogus narratives play a role in disinformation campaigns.The notion of disinformation often brings to mind easy-to-spot propaganda peddled by totalitarian states, but the reality is much more complex. Though disinformation does serve an agenda, it is often camouflaged in facts and advanced by innocent and often well-meaning individuals.:As a researcher who studies how communications technologies are used during crises, I've found that this mix of information types makes it difficult for people, including those who build and run online platforms, to distinguish an organic rumor from an organized disinformation campaign. And this challenge is not getting any easier as efforts to understand and respond to COVID-19 get caught up in the political machinations of this year's presidential election.Rumors, misinformation and disinformationRumors are, and have always been, common during crisis events. Crises are often accompanied by uncertainty about the event and anxiety about its impacts and how people should respond. People naturally want to resolve that uncertainty and anxiety, and often attempt to do so through collective sensemaking. It's a process of coming together to gather information and theorize about the unfolding event. Rumors are a natural byproduct.Rumors aren't necessarily bad. But the same conditions that produce rumors also make people vulnerable to disinformation, which is more insidious. Unlike rumors and misinformation, which may or may not be intentional, disinformation is false or misleading information spread for a particular objective, often a political or financial aim.:Disinformation has its roots in the practice of dezinformatsiya used by the Soviet Union's intelligence agencies to attempt to change how people understood and interpreted events in the world. It's useful to think of disinformation not as a single piece of information or even a single narrative, but as a campaign, a set of actions and narratives produced and spread to deceive for political purpose.Lawrence Martin-Bittman, a former Soviet intelligence officer who defected from what was then Czechoslovakia and later became a professor of disinformation, described how effective disinformation campaigns are often built around a true or plausible core. They exploit existing biases, divisions and inconsistencies in a targeted group or society. And they often employ ""unwitting agents"" to spread their content and advance their objectives.Black Lake in the Czech Republic was the site of a Soviet-era disinformation campaign against West Germany involving real Nazi documents and a duped Czech television crew.Ladislav Bohac/Flickr, CC BY-SARegardless of the perpetrator, disinformation functions on multiple levels and scales. While a single disinformation campaign may have a specific objective - for instance, changing public opinion about a political candidate or policy - pervasive disinformation works at a more profound level to undermine democratic societies.:The case of the 'Plandemic' videoDistinguishing between unintentional misinformation and intentional disinformation is a critical challenge. Intent is often hard to infer, especially in online spaces where the original source of information can be obscured. In addition, disinformation can be spread by people who believe it to be true. And unintentional misinformation can be strategically amplified as part of a disinformation campaign. Definitions and distinctions get messy, fast.Consider the case of the ""Plandemic"" video that blazed across social media platforms in May 2020. The video contained a range of false claims and conspiracy theories about COVID-19. Problematically, it advocated against wearing masks, claiming they would ""activate"" the virus, and laid the foundations for eventual refusal of a COVID-19 vaccine.Though many of these false narratives had emerged elsewhere online, the ""Plandemic"" video brought them together in a single, slickly produced 26-minute video. Before being removed by the platforms for containing harmful medical misinformation, the video propagated widely on Facebook and received millions of YouTube views.:As it spread, it was actively promoted and amplified by public groups on Facebook and networked communities on Twitter associated with the anti-vaccine movement, the QAnon conspiracy theory community and pro-Trump political activism.But was this a case of misinformation or disinformation? The answer lies in understanding how - and inferring a little about why - the video went viral.The video's protagonist was Dr. Judy Mikovits, a discredited scientist who had previously advocated for several false theories in the medical domain -- for example, claiming that vaccines cause autism. In the lead-up to the video's release, she was promoting a new book, which featured many of the narratives that appeared in the Plandemic video.One of those narratives was an accusation against Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases. At the time, Fauci was a focus of criticism for promoting social distancing measures that some conservatives viewed as harmful to the economy. Public comments from Mikovits and her associates suggest that damaging Fauci's reputation was a specific goal of their campaign.:Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, preparing to testify before a Senate hearing. Fauci was a target of the Plandemic conspiracy theory video.Kevin Dietsch/Pool via APIn the weeks leading up to the release of the Plandemic video, a concerted effort to lift Mikovits' profile took shape across several social media platforms. A new Twitter account was started in her name, quickly accumulating thousands of followers. She appeared in interviews with hyperpartisan news outlets such as The Epoch Times and True Pundit. Back on Twitter, Mikovits greeted her new followers with the message: ""Soon, Dr Fauci, everyone will know who you 'really are'.""This background suggests that Mikovits and her collaborators had several objectives beyond simply sharing her misinformed theories about COVID-19. These include financial, political and reputational motives. However, it is also possible that Mikovits is a sincere believer of the information that she was sharing, as were millions of people who shared and retweeted her content online.What's ahead:In the United States, as COVID-19 blurs into the presidential election, we're likely to continue to see disinformation campaigns employed for political, financial and reputational gain. Domestic activist groups will use these techniques to produce and spread false and misleading narratives about the disease - and about the election. Foreign agents will attempt to join the conversation, often by infiltrating existing groups and attempting to steer them towards their goals.[Deep knowledge, daily. Sign up for The Conversation's newsletter.]For example, there will likely be attempts to use the threat of COVID-19 to frighten people away from the polls. Along with those direct attacks on election integrity, there are likely to also be indirect effects - on people's perceptions of election integrity - from both sincere activists and agents of disinformation campaigns.Efforts to shape attitudes and policies around voting are already in motion. These include work to draw attention to voter suppression and attempts to frame mail-in voting as vulnerable to fraud. Some of this rhetoric stems from sincere criticism meant to inspire action to make the electoral systems stronger. Other narratives, for example unsupported claims of ""voter fraud,"" seem to serve the primary aim of undermining trust in those systems.:History teaches that this blending of activism and active measures, of foreign and domestic actors, and of witting and unwitting agents, is nothing new. And certainly the difficulty of distinguishing between these is not made any easier in the connected era. But better understanding these intersections can help researchers, journalists, communications platform designers, policymakers and society at large develop strategies for mitigating the impacts of disinformation during this challenging moment.:Kate Starbird, Associate Professor of Human Centered Design & Engineering, University of WashingtonThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

702,702,410.DidaMissileCausetheN,"Claim:An explosion in Nashville, Tennessee, on Dec. 25, 2020, was caused by a missile or a direct-energy weapon. Rating:FalseAbout this rating Many people woke up on Christmas morning in 2020 to the news that a large explosion had occurred near an AT&T building in downtown Nashville, Tennessee. As police set out to determine what happened -- authorities say that it was a suicide car bombing set up in the recreational vehicle of 63-year-old Anthony Quinn Warner -- conspiracy theorists went to work setting up an alternative narrative: The explosion was actually caused by a missile strike.  :This claim was spread on conspiratorial websites such as HalTurnerRadio.com and the right-wing social media network Parler, but is largely based on a single grainy piece of footage. Before we examine the video, let's look at the basis of this claim. Why Would a Missile Strike Occur in Nashville?Two theories have been floated to connect the dots between an explosion in Nashville (which truly did occur) and a missile strike (which did not). The first holds that the goal of the missile strike was to destroy Room 641A, a ""telecom intercept facility."" This theory may have made more sense if 641A was located in Nashville. This room, which was reportedly used to carry out a warrantless surveillance program authorized under the Patriot Act, is actually located in San Francisco, California. :The more prominent claim, however, attempted to connect the explosion in Nashville to conspiracy theories related to fraud in the 2020 election. This theory held that the U.S. government had ordered the missile strike in order to halt an audit on Dominion voting machines. We took a deeper look into this claim in our article here. In short, this ""audit"" is imaginary. AT&T was not conducting an audit of Dominion Voting Systems. While Room 641A is not located in Nashville, and while AT&T was not performing an audit on Dominion voting machines, it's in this context that many social media users viewed the ""missile"" attack video. The Nashville ""Missile"" Attack VideoThis claim is largely based on a single grainy piece of footage obtained by Nashville's WKRN News 2. Proponents of this theory claim that a missile can be seen descending just before the explosion. This streak of ""smoke"" is visible next to the furthest light post from the image foreground: : While we can't say for certain what caused this ""smoke,"" it appears that this streak of smoke is ascending, as if it were a piece of fiery debris from the explosion, and not descending, as if it were a missile. A second, faint ascending streak can also be seen behind the main streak, which seems to support the idea that this is debris shooting away from the explosion, not towards it. :The visuals in this video do not support the ""missile"" theory, and neither does the logic. Not only is this missile attack theory based on fictitious information (there was no audit of Dominion machines), we find it difficult to believe that a high-powered group with access to military weapons would launch a missile strike at Nashville's AT&T building and miss, striking an RV that was parked outside on the street.Ample Evidence the Explosion Came from the RVThe Nashville missile-strike conspiracy theory is largely based on speculation drawn from a single piece of grainy footage. Ample evidence exists, however, about what actually caused this explosion.In the wee hours of Dec. 25, police responded to calls of gunshots near the AT&T building. When they arrived, they found an RV that was broadcasting a message of an imminent explosion. Resident Betsy Williams said that she heard a computerized voice saying ""Evacuate now ... This vehicle will explode in 15 minutes."" Six uniformed officers also heard the warning message and started to evacuate the area. :Here's a video from a surveillance camera that captured this audio warning:A number of other videos also documented this blast. None of these videos shows anything resembling a missile strike. Here's a video of the explosion from the Nashville Police Department::Authorities have also determined that Warner was responsible for the bombing, although the motives of the long-time Nashville resident, who died in the blast, have yet to be determined.  Hundreds of tips and a phalanx of law enforcement officers helped determine that Anthony Quinn Warner triggered the bomb that rocked this city and took his life on Christmas morning.All that information and effort, however, have thus far failed to determine why. Investigators on Monday continued to try to put together the pieces.""These answers won't come quickly and will still require a lot of our team's effort,"" FBI Special Agent for Public Affairs Doug Korneski said Sunday. ""None of those answers will ever be enough for those who have been affected by this event.:"

She went peacefully in her sleep before being mostly devoured by her Lhasa Apso, and Chicago police have ruled out any foul play. The real story, however, is how she worded her Last Will and Testament. According to Illinois Comptroller and Keeper of the Public Record, Art Tubolls, ""Michelle"" doesn't legally exist:""Mrs. Robinson's will clearly states that her possessions should all go to 'my son, Michael Robinson Obama.' In Illinois, a person can't legally change their gender, so she had to use his real name or she wouldn't have gotten anything."":This item was not a factual recounting of real-life events. The article originated with a website that describes its output as being humorous or satirical in nature. In addition, the article exploits an unfounded fringe conspiracy theory about the former first lady's gender identity.For background, here is why we sometimes write about satire/humor."
