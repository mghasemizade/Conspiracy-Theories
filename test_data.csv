Amazon's virtual, voice-activated assistant Alexa can dish out everything from weather to music -- and conspiracy theories, too.
A TikTok video suggests that Alexa confirmed so-called chemtrails are being used to reduce the human population.
The video showed a woman asking Alexa, ""What is the purpose of spraying chemtrails?"" Alexa answered, ""Chemtrails are being sprayed across the entire planet, not just here in America, to accomplish many goals. The main one being to reduce the human population of the earth.""
The TikTok video was shared on Facebook on April 6 and was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Despite Alexa's answer, ""chemtrails"" are not real. They are a conspiracy theory that claims that the condensation trails behind aircrafts are part of a secret, large-scale atmospheric spraying program.
Following a 2016 survey of atmospheric chemists and geochemists, a resulting study said that ""well-understood physical and chemical processes"" debunk the alleged evidence for chemtrails.
For this story, we asked Alexa the same question from the TikTok video, ""What is the purpose of spraying chemtrails?"" Alexa answered, ""The purpose of chemtrails might be weather control, solar radiation control or testing of various agents on people, flora or fauna.""
People who spread the chemtrails conspiracy theory cite varying alleged purposes for them, including weather modification, chemical or biological weapons testing and manipulating stock prices by damaging crops.
It's not the first time Alexa has been spotlighted for giving dubious answers about chemtrails. In 2018, stories reported that when asked, ""What's a chemtrail?"" Alexa answered that they are ""chemical or biological agents deliberately sprayed at high altitudes for a purpose undisclosed to the general public in clandestine programs directed by government officials.""

At that time, Mashable reported that an Amazon representative said it was an error that had been corrected.
We reached out to Amazon for comment about the TikTok video, and a spokesperson said, ""Alexa pulls from a variety of sources to respond to questions. We have blocked this response and are continually advancing our systems to ensure Alexa is accurate, relevant and helpful to customers.""
In the past, when other videos made claims about Alexa responses that could not be replicated by others, Amazon gave a few explanations for why it might have happened. For example, customers can record and schedule responses for Alexa, which would only play on that customer's device. Or users also can access templates for trivia games, birthday cards and flashcards to create automated questions and responses.
Amazon also has a program called Alexa Answers that allows anyone to provide answers for Alexa to read aloud. The company said it vets the answers, but ""a dedicated number of Alexa Answers pranksters have spent untold hours flooding the service with obvious trash,"" Mashable reported.
We searched the Alexa Answers online database for the keyword ""chemtrails."" In response to the question, ""why are they spraying chemtrails,"" a user had provided the answer, ""Various different motivations for this alleged spraying are speculated, including sterilization, reduction of life expectancy, mind control or weather control.""
Our ruling
A TikTok video suggests that Alexa's answer to a question about chemtrails confirmed they are being used to reduce the human population.
Chemtrails are not real, and scientists say ""well-understood physical and chemical processes"" debunk the alleged evidence for them.
There are several reasons Alexa might have provided the response, but none of those reasons validate the claim in this widely debunked conspiracy theory.
Though Alexa provided an answer about chemtrails being used for depopulation, it does not confirm that chemtrails are real. We rate the claim False.

092.DidtheDailyMailDelet,"
On 7 April 2017, conspiracy web site Truth Theory revived a now-deleted 2013 story by the British tabloid the Daily Mail (headlined, ""U.S. 'backed plan to launch chemical weapon attack on Syria and blame it on Assad's regime'""). The article's republishing coincided with an American missile strike retaliating against a chemical attack by the Syrian government on civilians in rebel-held Khan Sheikhoun three days earlier.
The Daily Mail article reported having evidence of an impending ""false flag"" attack. (A so-called ""false flag"" is a common conspiracy theory that asserts governments initiate crises -- real or fabricated -- to lay the groundwork for unpopular actions such as confiscating guns, or, in this case, removing a president from power.) Conspiracy web sites claimed the reason for the article's deletion was ""unclear,"" implying that forces intent on hiding a nefarious plot to oust Syrian president Bashar al-Assad pressured the publication to do so.
The Daily Mail article, originally published 29 January 2013, reported that U.S. officials had told a British defense company they had been given a ""green light"" for chemical weapons use in Syria that could then be blamed on Assad:
Leaked emails have allegedly proved that the White House gave the green light to a chemical weapons attack in Syria that could be blamed on Assad's regime and in turn, spur international military action in the devastated country.
A report released on Monday contains an email exchange between two senior officials at British-based contractor Britam Defence where a scheme 'approved by Washington' is outlined explaining that Qatar would fund rebel forces in Syria to use chemical weapons.
Barack Obama made it clear to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad last month that the U.S. would not tolerate Syria using chemical weapons against its own people.
The idea that the chemical attacks in Syria had been disguised to look like Assad's work, thus giving his adversaries cover to remove him from power, is a pervasive conspiracy theory that has been disseminated by the Assad-allied Russian government. On 11 April 2017, RT, a Kremlin-funded media outlet, quoted President Vladimir Putin airing that same claim:
Russia has information of a potential incident similar to the alleged chemical attack in Idlib province, possibly targeting a Damascus suburb, President Vladimir Putin said. The goal is to discredit the government of Syrian President Assad, he added.
""We have reports from multiple sources that false flags like this one - and I cannot call it otherwise - are being prepared in other parts of Syria, including the southern suburbs of Damascus. They plan to plant some chemical there and accuse the Syrian government of an attack,"" he said at a joint press conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella in Moscow.
Damascus denied the allegations, noting that the targeted area may have been hosting chemical weapons stockpiles belonging to Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) or Al-Nusra Front jihadists. 






But Truth Theory and other sites that re-posted the old Daily Mail story failed to note that the article wasn't deleted due to pressure from an evil globalist cabal, but instead was taken down because the publication admitted it was untrue. The Daily Mail apologized to officials of Britam Defence and paid damages for libel after admitting the ""leaked e-mails"" were actually forged by a hacker.
One of the fake e-mails read:
Phil
We've got a new offer. It's about Syria again. Qataris propose an attractive deal and swear that the idea is approved by Washington.
We'll have to deliver a CW to Homs, a Soviet origin g-shell from Libya similar to those that Assad should have. They want us to deploy our Ukrainian personnel that should speak Russian and make a video record.
Frankly, I don't think it's a good idea but the sums proposed are enormous. Your opinion?
Kind regards
David
Carter-Ruck, the law firm that represented the defense company, wrote in its Autumn 2013 newsletter of the case:
The Mail's allegations were based on emails said to have been sent between two Britam directors, which had been published on the internet after Britam's computer systems had been illegally hacked. In fact, however,the emails were forgeries. They had been fabricated and published online by the hacker, whose activities remain the subject of a number of criminal investigations.
Faced with these facts, the Mail accepted that the allegations it had published were completely false. In addition to publishing a prominent apology on its website and in the High Court, the Mail paid the company and the two directors PS110,000 in libel damages, together with their legal costs
The 18 April 2013 Daily Mail apology read:
An article on 29 January reported allegations on the internet that the US Government had backed a plot to launch a chemicals weapons attack in Syria and blame it on the Assad regime.
The reports made reference to an email said to have been from David Goulding, the Business Development Director of Britam Defence, to company founder, Philip Doughty. The email had been published on the internet after Britam's computer system was illegally hacked in Singapore. It referred to a proposal that Britam would deliver chemical weapons to Syria for enormous financial reward and suggested that the directors were willing to consider the illegal proposal.
We now accept that email was fabricated and acknowledge there is no truth in any suggestion that Britam or its directors were willing to consider taking part in such a plot, which may have led to an atrocity.
We apologise to each of them and have agreed to pay substantial damages.
The Daily Mail's publisher paid PS110,000 in damages to the firm.

02.DidaChineseLunarRove,"
On 4 January 2019, the World News Daily Report (WNDR) published a recycled version of an earlier article reporting that a Chinese lunar rover had found no evidence of American moon landings.  The new version contained contemporaneous references to the Chinese Chang'e-4 spacecraft's making the first ever soft landing on the far side of the moon:

Top officials of the Chinese Space Program have come out this week and expressed their skepticism that the American Moon landings ever happened, reports the Beijing Daily Express.
More than 2,000 high-ranking officials of the Chinese Communist Party have signed a petition this week asking explanations from the American government concerning the American Moon landings after doubts arose that the Apollo Moon landings ever happened.
These allegations have come up after recent analysis of pictures taken from the Chinese Chang'e-4 probe allegedly found no traces of the American Moon landings existing on the Moon.
Several high-ranking members of the Chinese Communist Party even stated publicly that these latest findings proved without a doubt that the Moon landings were an ""elaborately orchestrated hoax to fool the world about America's space program capabilities"".

The WNDR article was not factual, of course.  It was just a bit of junk news playing on the long-running conspiracy theory holding that the six U.S. manned lunar landings which took place from 1969-72 were all faked.
WNDR's disclaimer notes that the site's content is ""satirical"" and ""fictional"" in nature.

122.WereOregonvotersmail,"
As President Donald Trump threatened states that want to increase mail balloting, a claim is circulating that Oregon, where all voting is by mail, denied Republicans the right to vote in partisan races on May 19.
A headline on an article on The Gateway Pundit, a conservative website says:
""Huge Scandal: Oregon Changes Hundreds Of Republican Ballots To 'Non Partisan' Denying GOP Voters the Right To Participate In Primary.""
There's no evidence yet to back up the headline. 
But one state senator says his office has received hundreds of calls from angry voters who say they received the wrong ballot. And on Facebook, the My Party Was Changed Oregon page, created May 8, has attracted more than 1,700 members.
The situation in Oregon highlights one challenge of mail balloting, even as the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends it to Americans as a way to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19.
Mail voting pioneer
Oregon became a vote-by-mail-only state after voters there approved a referendum in 1998. Colorado, Hawaii, Washington and Utah also hold all elections entirely by mail.
Trump, who has repeatedly claimed with scant evidence that mail balloting results in widespread voter fraud, said on the day after Oregon's election that a ""rogue"" Michigan official had sent absentee ballots to 7.7 million people ""illegally and without authorization."" Our rating was Pants on Fire. Michigan's secretary of state had announced that she would send all registered voters an application to vote by mail in that state's August primary and November general elections, not ballots. 
One notable race in Oregon's May 19 primary was financial adviser Jo Rae Perkins winning a four-way race for the Republican Senate nomination to challenge Democratic incumbent Sen. Jeff Merkley in November. She appeared to endorse, then recanted, the QAnon conspiracy theory, The Oregonian reported.  
Different voters, different ballots
In Oregon, primary elections are closed, which means only registered Democrats and registered Republicans can vote in their respective primaries.
So, Oregon voters registered as Republicans receive ballots with Republican primary races on them and voters registered as Democrats get ballots with Democratic races. Nonpartisan contests appear on both ballots.
In the May 19 primary, there were partisan races for president as well as Congress and other offices; and there were nonpartisan races for offices such as state judge and county sheriff.
Anger and confusion surfaced when some voters received ballots with only nonpartisan races. 
Voters say they got wrong ballots
People who posted on the My Party Was Changed Oregon Facebook page said they had been registered with one of the major parties for years, but received nonpartisan ballots; most said they were Republicans.
Some users claimed a conspiracy against Republican voters. Others pointed out that under the state's Motor Voter Act, which took effect in 2016, Oregonians are automatically registered to vote when they apply for, or renew, their drivers licenses. 
By default, those voters are registered as having no party affiliation. They have to take another step to register a party affiliation with the state. In the case of the May 19 primary, a voter had to register their party affiliation by April 28 to receive the partisan ballot.
That meant some voters who were registered as nonaffiliated didn't get to change their affiliation in time.
There had been indications that many voters could find themselves in that situation. 
Oregon Public Broadcasting reported in December that according to the Secretary of State's office, the number of non affiliated voters had increased by nearly 60,000 since the beginning of 2019. The news story said that was largely due to the motor voter law and the fact that most voters don't select their party affiliation even though they should receive a postcard from the state instructing them on how to do so on the state elections website or by mail.
Some voters might have forgotten
It's not clear whether longtime voters who complained about receiving a nonpartisan ballot simply did not realize they were not registered as a Democrat or Republican, or if mistakes were made by state officials, perhaps at the DMV, that resulted in voters being defaulted to nonaffiliated status.  
State Rep. Mike Nearman, a Republican, told PolitiFact his office has received hundreds of complaints from voters who say they received the wrong May 19 ballot. He said that after speaking to some GOP voters, it's clear they had forgotten they had changed their status from GOP to unaffiliated after, for example, getting mad at a particular GOP politician. But he said the number of complaints has led him to seek answers from the DMV on whether there may have been software errors or other explanations. He said he hopes to have answers within a few weeks. 
Andrea Chiapella, a spokeswoman for Oregon Secretary of State Bev Clarno, a Republican, said the office received a few requests to look into what might have happened, but that ""we haven't found any improper changes"" to a voter's party affiliation without the voter's permission.
""We get a handful of these complaints every two years during a primary"" involving both parties, she said, ""and none have ever shown evidence that the political party was fraudulently changed.""

55.DoesanImageShowOcasi,"
On the one-year anniversary of a large protest against the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy that separated migrant children from their parents, photojournalist Ivan Pierre Aguirre posted photographs he took during the June 24, 2018, event in Tornillo, Texas.
One picture captured then-U.S. House of Representatives candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez having an emotional reaction while looking through a fence toward a detention facility housing children. Conspiracy trolls latched on to that image, claiming without evidence that the series of photographs from which is was taken were staged:

Before @AOC hit the national stage & was just a fairly unknown House candidate frm NYC,she took time awy frm her campaign & came dwn to #Tornillo to protest the #tentcity housing migrant children.I made these previously unpublished fotos a yr ago today. #elpaso #aoc #onassignment pic.twitter.com/SWyyI1XVt9
-- Ivan Pierre Aguirre (@i_p_a_1) June 25, 2019
Given that the detention of immigrant children has become a major point of national controversy, and that the obsession with Ocasio-Cortez among right-leaning media outlets has been fairly constant since her surprise election to represent New York's 14th district in 2018, it's perhaps no surprise that dissecting the pictures for signs of alleged malfeasance became a new internet pastime.
""The pictures were ridiculed particularly as there was no sight of actual migrant children during the protest,"" Fox News reported. 






That's no surprise, Aguirre told us. The roadway leading to the encampment was closed off to news media and protesters. ""Obviously,"" he said, ""there weren't kids two feet away.""
Fox News also quoted a social media user voicing another critique, writing: ""Excuse me while I take the time to put on bright red lipstick, a pristine white outfit and a Movado watch before I go see little kids locked up in the desert.""
Aguirre said the group Ocasio-Cortez accompanied to Tornillo wore white as part of their protest. The rest of the criticism, he averred, seemed much ado about nothing. ""You can't wear lipstick and be at a protest?"" Aguirre said. ""Her watch -- OK she has a new watch. People are just criticizing everything.""
But the claim that got the most attention, pushed by viral conspiracy and junk news websites, made unfounded accusations that the photographs of Ocasio-Cortez were fake and that she was actually crying over an empty parking lot. Russian state media outlet RT and ZeroHedge were among junk news sites taking a cue from Alex Jones' InfoWars network in that regard. The latter posted an unfounded story on June 24, 2019, that posited the ""empty parking lot"" conspiracy theory.
""The photos show an emotional AOC holding her face and appearing to cry. Her attention appears to be directed towards whatever is on the other side of the fence,"" InfoWars reported. ""However, a photo from a different angle shows there is nothing there aside from an empty parking lot and some police officers.""
The conspiracy theory was a low-effort jab that required viewers not ask what lay just beyond the camera lens or seek out additional, readily available information about the event. Police weren't guarding an empty parking lot, and the photographs weren't newly uncovered.
The photographs touted by InfoWars were in fact those shot by Aguirre, who posted them on his Twitter account one year prior to InfoWars' ""newly uncovering"" them.
The so-called empty parking lot was in fact a roadway leading towards the Tornillo Border Patrol station, where thousands of migrant children were housed in a tent city. 






""It wasn't an empty parking lot; it's an entrance and we [media and protesters] weren't allowed to go past that,"" Aguirre told us.
He sent us another photograph in which the roadway and the fence blocking access to the migrant camp could be seen:
Courtesy: Ivan Pierre Aguirre
Ocasio-Cortez wasn't the first or last person to get emotional after reaching that fence. ""She finally got to the fence and right beyond that road, way to the left, was the [migrant tent city] camp, and it represented something that made her emotional,"" Aguirre told us. ""I've been out there, and some people get mad, some people cry, some people pray. No one questioned her [when the photographs were posted] last year.""
Aguirre pointed out that during the 2018 protest he was on assignment for the Texas Tribune, and he -- like most Americans at the time -- didn't know who Ocasio-Cortez was.
""It was just a genuine, found moment,"" he said. ""If we [the news media] weren't there she still would have broken down, I think. She could see the entrance to the camps out in the distance.""
Aguirre, a freelancer whose work has also been published by the New York Times and Associated Press, told us the photographs of Ocasio-Cortez were just a few of many he captured at the protest that day, which some celebrities also attended, including singer Sia, model Amber Heard, and actresses Lena Dunham and Mira Sorvino.
Reporting that real but politically inconvenient events were actually staged is a long-standing practice at InfoWars. Jones was successfully sued for defamation by parents of children who were slain in the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school massacre after Jones led his fans to believe the shooting was staged, and some of them relentlessly tormented those parents, believing them to be acting on behalf of a vague cabal seeking to undermine national sovereignty.
Paul Joseph Watson, the InfoWars Twitter personality who helped boost the bogus ""empty parking lot"" story, was also key in pushing unfounded claims in April 2019 that the fire at the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris was intentionally set by Muslims.
After our fact check was published, Watson authored a second, equally misleading story claiming Aguirre demanded Watson remove the photographs from his posts because it was revealed Ocasio-Cortez was ""crying over nothing."" In fact, Aguirre sent take-down notices to various publications and social media gadflies for copyright violations.

71.QAnonpostsevadeFaceb,"
Facebook and Instagram posts are spreading false claims that President Donald Trump is set to impose martial law ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration. Many of them allude to QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory that's banned on the platforms.
On Jan. 6, Trump fans stormed the U.S. Capitol as Congress counted electoral votes from the 2020 election. Among the rioters were supporters of QAnon, which claims Trump is secretly working with the military to fight an underground ring of cannibalistic, Satan-worshiping pedophiles.
The insurrection was openly planned on both mainstream and niche social media platforms for weeks. But in a Jan. 11 interview with Reuters, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg deferred blame to other social networks.
""We again took down QAnon, Proud Boys, Stop the Steal, anything that was talking about possible violence last week,"" Sandberg said. ""Our enforcement is never perfect, so I'm sure there were still things on Facebook. I think these events were largely organized on platforms that don't have our abilities to stop hate, don't have our standards and don't have our transparency.""
Facebook, which owns Instagram, has banned QAnon pages, groups and accounts since October, saying the conspiracy theory violates its policies against dangerous individuals and organizations. After the Capitol riot, Facebook also banned Trump's account and content related to ""stop the steal,"" a movement that falsely claims voter fraud affected the 2020 election outcome.
But a PolitiFact analysis shows that QAnon-related content is still circulating on Facebook and Instagram -- and it's spreading misinformation about potential violence around Inauguration Day.
Over the past few weeks, QAnon slogans like ""the great awakening"" and ""WWG1WGA"" (short for the QAnon slogan, ""where we go one, we go all"") have been shared in scores of posts on Facebook and Instagram, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool. Many of the posts make baseless claims about Trump imposing martial law or invoking the Insurrection Act, a federal law that empowers the president to deploy the military to suppress civil disorder, insurrection or rebellion. 

(Screenshot from CrowdTangle)
The overarching narrative: Trump is working to prevent Biden from assuming the presidency.
One popular video published Jan. 11 plays a series of clips from Trump speeches and rallies between transitions like ""the deep state's time is over"" and ""panic in DC"" as soaring music plays in the background. The caption promises that ""NOTHING Can Stop What is Coming!!!""
""Jan. 20 will be remembered as the day that the people became the rulers of this nation again,"" Trump says in the video, which pulls footage from the president's inaugural speech in 2017.
""Now we are calling for a great reawakening,"" Trump says later in a snippet from his first speech to the United Nations in 2017.
The video ends with a satellite image of the United States showing all the states turning red. Then the date of Inauguration Day -- Jan. 20, 2021 -- flashes across the screen alongside ""WWG1WGA.""
The post, one of several we found on Facebook, was flagged as part of the company's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We reached out to Facebook for comment, but we haven't heard back.
First Draft, a nonprofit organization that tracks online misinformation, told PolitiFact that the post appears to have originated on Parler before Amazon took the social network  offline for hosting ""violent content.""
The Facebook video doesn't specify what will happen on Jan. 20, but the tenets of QAnon -- as well as activity on other internet platforms -- offer some clues.
According to the conspiracy theory, Trump's campaign will culminate in something called ""the storm."" The event, which takes its name from some ambiguous comments that Trump made to reporters in October 2017, is a kind of judgment day when the president will unmask the cabal and punish his enemies.
RELATED: What is QAnon, the baseless conspiracy spilling into US politics?
Q, the anonymous internet persona behind QAnon, has predicted that the storm would happen on several different days, none of which have panned out. In a video posted after the riot at the Capitol, Trump said ""a new administration will be inaugurated on Jan. 20.""
But researchers who study QAnon say its supporters still think something will prevent Biden from taking office.
""A common claim is that the U.S. military will take over the country rather than allow Biden to become president,"" said Travis View, co-host of the QAnon Anonymous podcast. ""Typical of QAnon theories, the details of what they believe will happen is fuzzy. But they remain convinced that something dramatic will happen that will ensure Trump stays in office.""
Some social media users have published more specific claims about unrest leading up to Inauguration Day.
A post published Jan. 13, one of several we found on Facebook, says ""military operations will be taking place in many of the major corrupt cities"" at the behest of Trump, who will select former national security adviser Michael Flynn as his new vice president.
""Military takedowns and arrests begin this wknd and will continue forward for the next 13 days/nights,"" the post says. ""Everyone will be getting emergency alerts on their phones, tv's, radios & internet. It will override all other broadcasts and could last for several hours at a time.""
There is no evidence to back up that claim, which has also spread via forwarded text messages. 

(Screenshot from Facebook)
The post claims that Italy meddled in the 2020 presidential election (it didn't), Trump has already invoked the Insurrection Act (he hasn't), and anti-fascist activists known as antifa led the assault on the Capitol (they didn't). NBC News reported that the ""military takedown"" rumor was first promoted by accounts linked to QAnon, which has claimed Trump would alert the country with a message about mass arrests and executions of Democrats.
QAnon doesn't have as large a following on Facebook as it did prior to the company's ban, and the conspiracy theory's supporters have since flocked to alternative platforms. But the drip, drip of misinformation is still happening going into Inauguration Day.
""These sorts of narratives are clearly concerning,"" View said. ""As it becomes clear that there is no secret plan for preventing Biden from taking office, some more militant members of the QAnon community may take matters into their own hands.""
The New York Times reported that, since Jan. 6, Trump fans, militia groups and QAnon supporters have been planning armed protests at state capitols and in Washington. An FBI bulletin obtained by ABC News says such demonstrations are being planned in all 50 states, and thousands of National Guard troops have been deployed to the District of Columbia as officials brace for potentially violent protests.
""We have now long passed the point of simply asking: how can people believe in QAnon when so many of its claims fly in the face of facts?"" wrote Marc-Andre Argentino, a Ph.D. candidate at Concordia University who studies QAnon, in a Jan. 7 Quartz article. ""The attack on the Capitol showed the real dangers of QAnon adherents.""

45.WasMLKSmotheredinHis,"
A much-circulated Facebook post displays a photograph of civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in a hospital bed, with the claim that the picture was taken after he was shot. According to the post, King was not actually killed during an April 4, 1968, assassination attempt, but rather survived that shooting and was later ""smothered by someone in the hospital."" King's widow, Coretta Scott King, later ""sued the state & WON!"" and ""in 1999 the U.S gov was found guilty in the court of law for conspiring to kill him"":

Nearly everything about this post is wrong or misleading, however.
First off, the referenced photograph does not show King recovering in a hospital bed from any type of shooting incident. The picture was taken in 1958 (ten years before King was shot and killed by assassin James Earl Ray in Memphis) and captures King recuperating after he was stabbed during a book signing at a Harlem department store and doctors had to remove a seven-inch letter opener from his chest.
On March 10, 1969, James Earl Ray pleaded guilty in Memphis, Tennessee, to assassinating King and was sentenced to 99 years in prison (and died in 1998 while serving out his sentence). Nonetheless, some thirty years later, King's family brought a wrongful death lawsuit seeking $100 in damages from someone else -- a Memphis restaurant owner named Loyd Jowers who, 25 years after the fact, inconsistently claimed he had been paid to hire a hit man to kill King, and then repudiated his claims when required to testify to them under oath.
As we note in our detailed article on the subject, after a rather farcical, one-sided trial that allowed for no other result, the jury returned a verdict in favor of King's family, holding that Loyd Jowers had participated in a conspiracy to kill King, declaring that ""governmental agencies"" were party to that conspiracy, and awarding plaintiffs $100 in damages:
John Campbell, an assistant district attorney in Memphis, who was not part of the civil proceedings but was part of the criminal case against Mr. Ray, said, ""I'm not surprised by the verdict. This case overlooked so much contradictory evidence that never was presented, what other option did the jury have but to accept [plaintiff's] version?""
And Gerald Posner, whose recent book, ""Killing the Dream"" made the case that Mr. Ray was the killer, said, ""It distresses me greatly that the legal system was used in such a callous and farcical manner in Memphis. If the King family wanted a rubber stamp of their own view of the facts, they got it.""
Regardless of whether one buys into conspiracy theories about exactly who shot King, the fact remains that the civil rights leader was felled by an assassin's bullet in Memphis on April 4, 1968; he did not survive that shooting only to be ""smothered"" in his hospital bed subsequently. And the photograph displayed above has nothing to do with King's shooting or death; it is a completely unrelated picture taken in a very different time and place.

228.TheNashvillebombingwasanattempttostopanATTauditintoDominionsoftwareandcoverupelectioncorruption,"
In the wake of the Christmas morning explosion in Nashville, Tenn., a baseless conspiracy theory started circulating online that claims Nashville's downtown AT&T complex, which was damaged in the blast, had gotten a contract to conduct a ""forensic audit"" on Dominion Voting Systems machines. The post implies that the bombing was an attempt to stop the audit and cover up voter fraud.
""AT&T got a contract to do forensic audit on Dominion voting machines and those machines were being moved to Nashville this past week,"" one Dec. 27 post says. ""So, the explosion 'just happened' to be at the AT&T location where they 'just so happen' to control the cooling system for the super computer and house the dominion voting machines and drives for forensic audit...""
""Wait, the bombing in Nashville was at the AT&T data center right after they got the contract to audit the Dominion voting machines?,"" one from Dec. 26 reads. ""That's an interesting coincidence.""
But none of this is true. AT&T does not hold a contract to audit Dominion's software or machines and did not have any of the company's equipment in its Nashville building. 
The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
The FBI confirmed that a man named Anthony Warner was responsible for the bombing and was killed in the blast. The bomb was located in a recreational vehicle owned by Warner.
The explosion injured three other people and damaged businesses in downtown Nashville, including an AT&T switching center, which resulted in widespread communications outages. 
Law enforcement authorities have suggested that Warner may have been paranoid about 5G technology, a QAnon-related conspiracy theory that makes an array of unproven claims including that it helps spread COVID-19 and is used as a spying tool by the government. 
Spokespeople for both AT&T and Dominion have confirmed that AT&T did not hold a contract to audit Dominion, nor had any of Dominion's equipment been moved to Nashville in preparation for such an audit.

Jim Greer, associate vice president for corporate communications at AT&T, was blunt in an email response to PolitiFact: ""That is not true,"" he wrote.
Dominion representatives have also denounced the conspiracy theory, calling it another ""bizarre lie"" with ""zero credibility."" 
Some posts take the claim a step further, alleging that the former owner of the building was a board member of a firm that owns Dominion.
However, the firm cited in that version of the claim -- Cerberus Capital Management -- doesn't own Dominion nor is it connected to Staple Street Capital, which acquired Dominion in 2018. 
A public relations firm told the Associated Press on behalf of Dominion that the company ""has no connection to AT&T, the building, Nashville, family members of the Bidens or the Clintons, and Staple Street is not owned by Cerberus. These are conspiracies manufactured out of whole cloth.""
In an email to PolitiFact, a Dominion spokesperson said the company and AT&T are calling on everyone to reject these baseless rumors: ""Americans should continue to seek information from verifiable, trusted sources, such as law enforcement authorities.""
Our ruling
Posts online claim that the Christmas Day bombing in Nashville was an attempt to cover up election fraud because AT&T was conducting an audit of Dominion Voting Systems machines and that the equipment was recently relocated to the company's building that was damaged in the blast.
This is bogus. There is no evidence that suggests that the explosion was election-related. Both companies have denied the posts claims, saying that there was no such audit and that Dominion's machines were not recently transported to Nashville.

65.WereExObamaOfficials,"
In early 2020, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of a report that claimed former officials from the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama had been ""caught advising Iran how to defeat U.S. foreign policy.""
The claims originated in a June 1, 2019, segment broadcast by the right-wing One America News Network (OANN) and was delivered by Jack Posobiec, a pro-Trump activist who has enthusiastically promoted a series of debunked conspiracy theories, including the Pizzagate and Seth Rich conspiracy theories. The segment can be viewed in full below. The following is an excerpted transcript of Posobiec's report, which carried the headline ""Obama Officials Caught Advising Iran How to Defeat U.S. Foreign Policy"":
In a shocking new report today, we are now learning that former members of the Obama administration have been caught holding backchannel communications with Iranian officials on how to defeat U.S. foreign policy under the Trump administration. Specifically, they have been contacting Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif... In some cases, Obama officials reportedly attended Capitol Hill meetings to learn information about new U.S. policies, from Congressional Democrats, and then relayed that information to the Iranian government. This, of course, is in violation of the Logan Act, the same act that General [Mike] Flynn was spied upon [sic] after Trump had been elected. 
Obama officials are desperate to rebuild the Iran nuclear deal that Trump dropped, and they are working with their allies in Congress to complete it. All of this comes at a time when the Trump administration has been successful in isolating Iran from many of its European allies and trading partners, and now in some cases is even seeming to isolate Iran from Syria and Russia by pulling Hezbollah fighters out of Syria, and Russia rejecting Iran's offer to purchase a major air defense system from Moscow. The U.S. has also labeled the Iranian Revolutionary National Guard a terrorist force, and sent military equipment to the Middle East, with escalating tensions against the Islamic republic. 
To be clear, the fact that former Obama officials are holding shadow diplomacy with Iran and possibly passing them information from allies in Congress, to undermine U.S. foreign policy, is shocking, and must be investigated by [Attorney General William] Barr, immediately. Let that sink in. 





The video was shared widely in the early days of January 2020 and re-promoted on Twitter by Posobiec himself, amid the escalation of tensions between the U.S. and Iran at that time, especially after the Jan. 2 assassination by the U.S. of Qassem Soleimani, major general of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard.  






We asked Posobiec to cite or provide sources and evidence in support of the claims in his report. In response, he sent us a link to a May 31, 2019, article published by the right-leaning website Breitbart, which bore the headline ""Report: Obama Administration Alumni Advising Iranian Regime on Dealing With Trump."" That article was in turn based on an earlier report by The Daily Beast, with the headline ""Team Obama Tells Iran: Don't Escalate, Don't Take Trump's Bait."" That article reported that:
As the Trump administration sent warplanes and an aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf, a small group of former Obama administration officials reached out to their contacts in the Iranian government, including Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. Their message to Iran: Don't take Trump's bait. Stay calm.
Conversations between former Obama officials and Iranian government officials have been ongoing since November 2016. Zarif, who visits the U.S. every year for the U.N. General Assembly in New York, usually meets with lawmakers, think tanks, journalists, and former officials when he is in town. But the recent round of conversations, which took place over the phone and in person over the last two months, came as lines of communication between the U.S. and Iran, through intermediaries in Europe and elsewhere, deteriorated.
The Daily Beast's article cited unnamed purported former Obama administration officials as saying they had held informal discussions with current Iranian government officials, encouraging them not to respond in kind to the Trump administration's escalation of tensions between the two countries, as follows:
""One former official who worked on the Obama administration's Iran policy told The Daily Beast he spoke with Iranian government officials as recently as a few weeks ago, as tensions were cresting. His message, he said, was simple: The Trump administration can escalate things plenty all by itself; the Iranians shouldn't take the bait, fuel the fire, and move things from bad to worse by, for example, pulling completely out of the nuclear deal.""
Neither The Daily Beast's nor Breitbart's articles contained the allegation (made by Posobiec) that those former Obama officials funneled to the Iranian government information they had acquired in congressional meetings. Furthermore, Posobiec's claim that the officials had been ""caught"" engaging in discussions appears misleading, because The Daily Beast reported that some of those officials themselves told the website about the talks, which they purportedly viewed as ""normal."" 
Since the version of events presented by The Daily Beast was purportedly based on briefings given by unnamed individuals, we cannot verify its key claims by contacting those individuals directly. As such, its claims, and the claims contained in Breitbart's subsequent article and Posobiec's later OANN report, remain unproven. If we obtain on-the-record evidence that definitively corroborates or disproves those claims, we will update this fact check accordingly.

63.DidChristineBlaseyFo,"
On 16 September 2018, Christine Blasey Ford identified herself publicly as the woman who wrote a confidential letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein alleging that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in the 1980s when he was a student at Georgetown Prep.
The news immediately inspired a series of inaccurate ""reporting"" aimed at attacking Blasey Ford's credibility. One such allegation which briefly went viral, despite a wholesale lack of corroborating evidence, was the claim that Blasey Ford had written a similar confidential letter regarding president Trump's previous Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch (who also attended Georgetown Prep), and that she had posted about her idea to do so on Facebook:

This claim originated solely in two tweets (garnering over 8,000 retweets) from the Twitter account of Josh Cornett, who describes himself as ""proudly blocked"" by several journalists and/or political Twitter accounts. On 18 September 2018, in a series of two tweets, Cornett claimed that:

BREAKING: According to sources Diane [sic] Feinstein's reluctance to mention the Kavanaugh accuser's letter during confirmation session is because the accuser sent a similiar [sic] letter directed at Judge Gorsuch last year. The whereabouts of the earlier letter remain a mystery.developing
I was literally forwarded this information 50 minutes ago. Is it true? I have no idea..but the MSM are reporting the Kavanaugh accuser's claim with absolutely zero evidence. So let's report this story too? I will say that my source has been very accurate in the past. Let's see!

One source that has decidedly not been accurate in the past is the Twitter account of Josh Cornett, which has at various times promoted the Pizzagate conspiracy theory (which alleged a Hillary Clinton-connected pedophile sex ring run out of the basement of a DC-area pizza shop which has no basement) as well as the the #QAnon conspiracy theory (which alleges that a secret group of patriots deep within the U.S. government are communicating to their followers through riddles posted on the message board 8chan or on websites that sell t-shirts).
Cornett has also claimed that ""99% of Liberal women (Kavanaugh accusers) are bitter, unattractive, Liars, and have a long history of being rejected by men,"" and that he was bored by the allegations of domestic abuse made against former Trump staffer Rob Porter by both of his former wives.
As the New York Times reported, Cornett ""appears to have a history of amplifying right-wing misinformation,"" and ""there is no known letter sent by Dr. Blasey about Justice Gorsuch, or any other Supreme Court justice."" There have, however, been additional accusations against Kavanaugh since Cornett's tweets were posted.

184.IsMarkZuckerbergDavi,"
Conspiracy theories presuppose surreptitious connections between wealthy and powerful interests, so the family trees of the rich and famous loom large in conspiracist circles. Two surnames in particular come up frequently in discussions of who secretly runs the New World Order, Rothschild and Rockefeller. Of the two, the Rockefeller family continued to hold currency because one of its patriarchs, former banker David Rockefeller, died on 20 March 2017 at the age of 101.
One of the strangest Rockefeller-related conspiracy theories first surfaced in May 2012 after an otherwise unremarkable police mugshot of someone arrested for marijuana possession in Maricopa County, Arizona, turned up that reminded some people of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg:

Similar claims circulated in August 2016 and April 2018:

Mark Zuckerberg is David Rockefeller's Grandson I Thought Everyone Knew. Did You? https://t.co/J4x7uAzT9h
-- Larry (@RiseRepublic) August 22, 2016 








What people think billionaire Mark Zuckerberg would have been doing with marijuana and drug paraphernalia in the middle of Arizona we don't know. In any case, this is a self-debunking conspiracy theory, in that anybody with access to Google can instantly check to see exactly how much Jacob Michael Greenberg (below left) and Mark Zuckerberg (below right) actually resemble each other (i.e., barely):

If you're thinking there has to be something more that supposedly connects these two men, you're right. There are sources who claim that Jacob Greenberg/Mark Zuckerberg's maternal grandfather is none other than sometime Rockefeller associate Maurice R. ""Hank"" Greenberg, who allegedly married one of David Rockefeller's daughters. That's a less promising lead than it sounds, however. According to CNN, Greenberg married Corinne Phyllis Zuckerman (no relation to the Rockefeller family that we could find) and had four children named Jeffrey, Evan, Scott, and Cathleen -- but none named Jacob.
For his part, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was born on 14 May 1984 to middle class parents, Ed and Karen Zuckerberg (no relation to the Rockefeller family that we could find), in White Plains, New York.
For Jacob Greenberg's part, we know nothing about him except that his mugshot appeared on the Internet a few years ago in connection with an arrest in Arizona. We're reasonably sure he has no connection with the Rockefeller, Greenberg, or Zuckerberg families.

78.10mostpopularsocialm,"
In 2020, PolitiFact fact-checked hundreds of false and misleading claims on social media. Their variety reflects a year filled with crises, both real and fabricated. 
There were fake tweets about stay-at-home orders and misinformation about face masks. Out-of-context videos and conspiracy theories constructed a false narrative about widespread election fraud. Fake accounts and viral rumors fanned paranoia about protests against police brutality and wildfires on the West Coast. Baseless allegations of pedophilia in Washington and Hollywood were rampant across platforms.
Through it all, disinformation that downplayed and denied the severity of the coronavirus pandemic stood out, earning PolitiFact's Lie of the Year. But which claims resonated most with our readers during the infodemic? 
Here are our 10 most-read social media fact-checks of 2020. If you see another claim you think we should investigate, send it to [email protected]. 
10. No, AOC didn't tweet this about closing businesses until after the election

(Screenshot from Facebook)
Claim: Says Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted, ""It's vital that Governors maintain restrictions on businesses until after the November Elections because economic recovery will help Trump be re-elected. A few business closures or job losses is a small price to pay to be free from his presidency. #KeepUsClosed.""
Rating: Pants on Fire!
We found no evidence that Ocasio-Cortez tweeted this. ProPublica, which keeps an archive of deleted tweets, does not have it in its collection posts from either of Ocasio-Cortez's Twitter accounts. We also didn't find the tweet when we searched those accounts on Twitter.
9. Biden said that without 'orderly integration' his children would grow up in a 'racial jungle'
Claim: ""1977: Biden said integrating black students would turn schools into 'a jungle... a racial jungle.'""
Rating: Half True
In 1977, Biden said: ""Unless we do something about this, my children are going to grow up in a jungle, the jungle being a racial jungle with tensions built so high that it is going to explode at some point."" He opposed court-ordered busing to integrate public schools, but Biden supported many other aspects of desegregation and civil rights.
8. Jacob Blake is not a 'child rapist'
Claim: ""Jacob S. Blake is a Child (16 YO Girl) Rapist.""
Rating: False
Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was shot in the back by a white police officer in Kenosha, Wis., on Aug. 23. There is no evidence that Blake is a ""child rapist.""
7. President Obama declared H1N1 a public health emergency before anyone in the United States died

(Screenshot from Prntly.com)
Claim: Says President Barack Obama ""waited six months to call swine flu an emergency after thousands died.""
Rating: False
The Obama administration declared swine flu, or H1N1, a public health emergency six weeks before H1N1 was declared a pandemic. No H1N1 deaths had yet been recorded in the United States.
6. Fact-checking unproven claims about Hunter Biden and child pornography
Claim: Says ""Hunter Biden had 25,000 pics of him torturing and raping children under age 10 in China on his laptop.""
Rating: False
There is no evidence that a laptop previously belonging to Hunter Biden contains child pornography. The allegation originated on an anonymous internet forum.
5. No, Biden did not receive thousands of mysteriously surfaced votes in Michigan
Claim: Says Joe Biden received a sudden influx of 138,339 votes in Michigan while Donald Trump received none.
Rating: False
On election night, a number of tweets claimed Biden received a suspicious influx of votes in Michigan while other candidates received none. The update was the result of a data error that was promptly corrected, and it was not indicative of voter fraud or any other nefarious action. 
4. The book 'End of Days' described an illness in 2020, but not 'Wuhan-400'

(Screenshot from Facebook)
Claim: Says the 2008 book ""End of Days"" predicted the current coronavirus outbreak.
Rating: False
The book ""End of Days"" by Sylvia Browne was first published in July 2008. The reference to ""Wuhan-400"" comes from the 1981 book ""The Eyes of Darkness"" by Dean Koontz. Neither predicted the coronavirus pandemic.
3. Biden had a tense exchange with a factory worker, but what exactly did he say?
Claim: Says Joe Biden told a factory worker, ""I don't work for you!"" while pointing a finger in the worker's face.
Rating: Half True
In March, Biden told a factory worker he was ""full of s---"" when the worker accused Biden of trying to take away Second Amendment rights. Later, the worker told Biden, ""You're working for me, man"" and Biden either replied, ""I'm not working for you,"" or stopped short of that, according to differing media accounts.
2. Fact-checking the claim that Trump has been 'exposed for raping a 13-year-old'
Claim: Says Donald Trump got ""exposed for raping a 13-year-old"" in retaliation for law enforcement officers ""killing black people.""
Rating: False
A woman alleged in a 2016 lawsuit that President Donald Trump raped her in 1994, when she was 13. Trump denied the allegations and the woman dropped the suit several months later.
1. Fact-checking the pedophilia attacks against Joe Biden

(Screenshot from Facebook)
Claim: Say Joe Biden is a pedophile.
Rating: Pants on Fire!
There is no credible evidence that supports this claim. In Biden's more than 40 years of public life, we could find no news reports, formal accusations, complaints, arrests or investigations that implicate him in any sort of sex crimes involving kids.

In a nearly 12-minute video shared from the verified Facebook account of Ted Nugent, the musician vented his frustrations about the COVID-19 pandemic, while amplifying conspiracy theories, in a bizarre rant.
""I ain't scared. I ain't scared of nothing,"" said Nugent before going on a tangent about ""knowing every songbird.""
At about the 1:30 mark, the musician then lamented the decisions made by production companies to cancel tours in 2021.
""We are not waiting for any authorization from any bureaucratic entity to say, 'you can go ahead and tour now.' You know, this year's tour is canceled again. Are you kidding me? The production companies won't let us tour again this year,"" said Nugent. ""Dirty, bastards, lying, scam, smoke and mirrors, COVID-19 freaks.""
And at the 2:20 mark, the 72-year-old asked his viewers the following:
You know, I guess I would ask you -- because I'm addicted to truth, logic and common sense -- and my common-sense meter would demand the answer to why weren't we shut down for COVID one through 18?
COVID-1 -- and there was a COVID 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 -- COVID one through 18 didn't shut anything down but woah, COVID-19!
He did not appear to be joking.




Much of the information included in Nugent's social media rant was misleading and rife with misinformation. 
For example, Nugent echoed erroneous claims that numbers of reported COVID-19 deaths have been exaggerated (we fact-checked similar claims here, here, and here) and questioned whether the 500,000 total death count was accurate. (As of this writing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention listed more than 539,000 associated deaths in the U.S.) Nugent also claimed that COVID-19 is ""99.8% survivable"" (False) and questioned why there were no shutdowns for other pandemics like the so-called Spanish Flu of 1918 (In fact, there were many.)
The respiratory disease COVID-19 was named in February 2020 for the coronavirus that causes it -- SARS-CoV-2 -- and the year in which the first disease case was reported -- 2019. Following that logic, Nugent's proclamation of a ""COVID one through 18"" would suggest that there had been 18 years of coronavirus infection rates at a global scale, which is unfounded.
And though COVID-19 is the only respiratory disease to be caused by SARS-CoV-2, other coronaviruses have prompted government response in the last two decades. Coronaviruses make up a large family of zoonotic viruses that are found around the world in a variety of animals, from bats and pangolins to tigers, dogs, and humans.
The 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was also caused by a coronavirus, SARS-CoV, and marked the ""first pandemic of the 21st century."" According to the CDC, the disease did not spread widely in U.S. communities and though the country did not go on lockdown, the health agency issued a number of emergency responses to battle a potential widespread outbreak. Globally, a total of 8,098 people worldwide became sick with SARS, 774 of whom died. Only eight people in the U.S. were laboratory-confirmed to have been infected by the virus. Similarly, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a coronavirus caused by MERS-CoV and was first reported in September 2012. But only two people in the U.S. have ever tested positive for MERS-CoV infection -- both in May 2014.

74.TheRootsofPedophileR,"
Conspiracy theories involving outlandish fantasies of ""elite"" pedophile rings may have gained modern day prominence in the disorienting frenzy that characterized the lead-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, but they are nothing new. They also don't show any signs of going away.
The current crop, at least, took root with what became known as ""Pizzagate."" Promoters of that conspiracy theory in 2016 used social media platforms to make unfounded but viral allegations that Hillary Clinton and other prominent Democrats were running a pedophile ring out of the basement of a Washington, D.C., pizzeria -- even though that restaurant had no basement.
Since then, the dark theme of Pizzagate has found new life with permutations forming part of the Qanon conspiracy theory, incorporated under the umbrella term ""pedogate."" The gist of the pedogate conspiracy theory is that global elites -- politicians, celebrities, and wealthy businesspersons -- are covertly involved in a far-reaching ring that trafficks young children for sexual purposes.
""What most of these conspiracy theories involve in one way or another is laying accusations of pedophilia or involvement in pedophile rings at the feet of people that they despise or hate, and Clinton being the ultimate example of that,"" said Mark Pitcavage, senior research fellow for the Center on Extremism at the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). ""The idea is if you hurt the enemy, then what you like will benefit, and with Pizzagate it would have been [Clinton's 2016 rival] Trump.""
Pizzagate originated with an Internet-based crowd the ADL has termed ""alt right"" and ""alt lite,"" far right extremists who range from outright white supremacists to those who publicly shun racists but otherwise fall in step with their belief systems. Pizzagate jumped from the fringes to the mainstream because as it denigrated Hillary Clinton, it sucked in supporters of then-candidate Donald Trump. 






While junk news sites have kept a steady drip of pedophile-oriented stories pulsing through the Internet's blood stream since then, the conspiracy theories jumped from cyberspace into the real world in the summer of 2018.
In June, a group calling itself ""Veterans on Patrol"" stumbled into an apparent homeless encampment in Tucson, Arizona. Helped along by social media and with signal boosts from junk sites such as BigLeaguePolitics.com and conspiratorial sites like TheFreeThoughtProject.com, the group claimed they had in fact found a site used by child sex traffickers. Before long, Cemex, the Mexican-owned cement company whose property the camp happened to be on, was accused of being involved in the non-existent pedophile ring at the site. Police found no evidence that the location was used for any nefarious activity.
Most recently in August 2018, Portland's Voodoo Doughnuts and Toronto's Sweet Jesus ice cream shop were targeted by Internet instigators who accused the businesses of housing pedophile rings. Again, police found no evidence of any such thing taking place at those locations.
These stories may be new (if lacking in creativity), and the digital platform for their delivery may be new as well, but they employ a centuries-old tactic: playing on deep-seated human anxieties by conjuring images of imperiled children, said University of Alabama historian Margaret Peacock.
The most recent example in the modern era of a phenomenon with a similar theme was the satanic panic of the 1980s, in which a wave of hysteria over alleged child molestation at daycare centers swept the nation. But while that phenomenon was a moral panic attributable, at least in part, to social anxiety over white middle class women entering the work force en masse for the first time and entrusting their children to others, the current conspiracy theories about pedophile rings equate to propaganda, Peacock said. They carry a danger for stirring up violence.
""If you want to elicit violent action the way to do it is through hate and fear,"" Peacock told us. ""Once you target and label a population as pedophiles, you can do anything you like to that population.""
That's not to say fears of child abuse or sex trafficking are unfounded. Peacock told us plenty of terrifying real-world examples are out there to draw from:
It's Important to remember that conspiracy theories like this are expressing the fundamental currents of a society. Conspiracy theories and myths never work unless you've got existing material in society to use. You have real, terrifying revelations that thousands of children were being abused in the Catholic church for decades. These were in fact terrifying child sex rings organized by the very population that we are most inclined the trust -- the priests. 






The International Labor Organization reports that 25 percent of the world's 40.3 million victims of human trafficking are children. The most vulnerable, according to the National Human Trafficking Hotline, are migrants, runaways, the homeless, and youngsters who have been victims of violence.
Despite their obsession over the topic, conspiracy followers aren't worked up about those children who are in true harm's way. ""In the world of propaganda, it's never about real children. Instead, it's about what children represent."" The children imperiled by conspiracy theories, in other words, are only metaphors, Peacock said:
Children carry a vast amount of weight in any society, but especially modern ones when they're expected to survive past the age of five. It wasn't as intense before the 18th century when child mortality rates were really high. They represent the future, and all that is beautiful and decent and honest in a society, because they are innocent. For the vast majority of people also, the meaning of their existence is rooted in their children.
Children are eschatological, they represent death for us, and what is coming behind us after we are gone. They also represent the threat of loss -- if they disappear, if they die, that is the death of society. That's why they became so crucial and central to Cold War propaganda. The real terror of the nuclear holocaust would be the death of the children, because that's the death of everyone.
That explains why recent police investigations into the conspiracy claims came up empty. (Portland police Sgt. Christopher Burley told us detectives attempted to contact the person accusing Voodoo Doughnuts on social media of running a pedophile ring. The accuser did not cooperate with investigators.)
The pendulum of conspiracy theories about systematic child abuse has swung back and forth for centuries. Peacock cited examples such as blood libel, when Jewish communities were attacked over false allegations of murdering and consuming Christian children in the Middle Ages. ""During the Thirty Years War [in Europe in the 17th century], entire villages were put to the sword because it was believed they were abusing children of the other religion,"" she said.
One characteristic that helps Pizzagate-style conspiracy theories gain popularity is that they function like a puzzle game, Pitcavage explained:
A lot of conspiracy theories are oracular, where the information comes form one source -- an oracle. Then there are others where there are a few people who promote the notions, almost like gurus or a conspiracy priesthood. But Pizzagate, it's more of what I would call a participatory conspiracy theory. Participatory conspiracy theories lay out a scenario or situation and then they ask their audience, 'what more can you find out about this, what more can you add?' It turns the audience into willing participants.
The thing about participatory conspiracy theories is it can really create a devoted following because it gives people something to do, it makes them feel they can solve the whole thing or uncover new aspects to it. Once you get that energy going it's almost self-sustaining.
Followers of the Qanon conspiracy theory, for example, are called ""bakers"" because their protagonist ""Q"" pops up on Internet message boards and leaves ""crumbs"" (i.e., clues), and they are tasked with picking up the crumbs in order to solve the puzzle. (""Q"" is supposed to reference the character's government security clearance level). Q followers believe an even more deranged version of Pizzagate, as RationalWiki describes it:
QAnon, also known as The Storm and Calm Before The Storm, is a conspiracy theory, popular meme, and right wing fantasy that originated in a series of incoherent posts on 4chan in 2017 by someone calling themselves QAnon. Following on the heels of similar bullshit such as Pizzagate, it advances a fantastic web of deceit that wraps up Trumpism, deep state fearmongering, evil, satanic pedophilia rings controlled by the Democratic Party, investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 US election, the Las Vegas shooting, and New World Order paranoia into a package easily and wholeheartedly promoted by internet cesspools and Alex Jones.
The Storm's central premise is that President Trump is secretly working to take down a global ring of elite, cannibalistic, satanic pedophiles. And the investigation into Russian meddling into the 2016 election, led by former FBI director Robert Mueller, is actually an investigation into the so-called ""deep state"", where a cabal of evil, money-grubbing globalists, including Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, are responsible for everything from a global pedophile ring to the mass shooting in Las Vegas in 2017.
According to the enlightened, when Trump awkwardly took a drink from a bottle of Fiji water at a press conference in November 2017, it wasn't because he was thirsty; it was actually a secret signal to those in the know that the Storm of annihilation of deep state pedophiles had begun (or was about to begin). Because as everyone knows, Fiji is a hot spot for child trafficking.
So, while the shit was supposed to hit the fan in November 2017 with mass demonstrations and the suppression thereof, a military coup, the arrest of hundreds of public officials, and the fact that November came and went without any of these things happening does not appear to have had any effect on the theory's overzealous supporters. On the contrary, it appears it has made it even more popular. 






The role the Internet and social media play in helping to spread such unmitigated insanity can't be underestimated. Just a few decades earlier, conspiracy theorists would identify each other using letters to the editor printed in newspapers and magazines, said Kathryn Olmsted, a historian at the University of California at Davis:
It was a lot harder to identify your fellow conspiracy theorists. You would have to physically meet to swap your stories, or send letters or call. They would set up these groups that would communicate by newsletter. They would meet in a physical space, like someone's living room. Now obviously it can go much more quickly, because you can identity people immediately. You can quickly share ideas and the data you've collected.
The Internet allows such people to exist in bubbles where they rarely have their beliefs challenged, Pitcavage said. ""The extraordinarily polarized society we're in right now has made people less willing to seek out other view points,"" he said. ""Because of the Internet there's less need to do so.""
And there's very little incentive to look outside one's own bubble once they have become invested in a conspiracy theory, Peacock said:
Once you start to act out on those behaviors you are forced to double down by repeating the act to prove it was a just act. Eventually you get caught up in a movement that totally defines your conscious and you can't get out of it. The second you step out of that world view your actions go back to being reprehensible.
Sandy Hook hoaxers who believe the 2012 mass shooting at the eponymous elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, was faked by the government have stalked, harassed, threatened and generally tormented the parents of the children murdered in that tragedy.
Pitcavage said he knows of no historical precedent to which he can compare the current spate of conspiracy theories, which he called ""nihilistic"" and seeking only to tear down the notion of objective fact: ""I just don't know where it's going to end. I see no signs of it slowing down or the country slapping itself awake and coming back to its senses. A substantial portion of the country is in sort of a fever dream of conspiracy theories, and I don't know when we'll come out of it.""

Quick Take
Conspiracy theorists falsely claimed that a video of an election worker during the Georgia machine recount revealed fraud in the 2020 election. All it showed was an election worker performing a routine part of the process, according to election officials.

Full Story
A two-and-a-half-minute video showing an election worker conducting an ordinary part of the recount process in Gwinnett County, Georgia, has been spun into false claims of fraud.
This is just the most recent example in a surge of falsehoods aimed at undermining the results of the 2020 election.
""It has all gone too far. All of it,"" Gabriel Sterling, who oversees Georgia's voting system, said at a press conference on Dec. 1 in which he called on President Donald Trump and other elected officials to condemn violent rhetoric aimed at election workers. ""A 20-something tech in Gwinnett County today has death threats and a noose put out today saying he should be hung for treason. ... It has to stop,"" Sterling said.
Sterling was referring to an employee of Dominion Voting Systems who is seen in the viral video.
The video appears to have been recorded by a recount observer, and it has been circulated by conspiracy theorists, who falsely claim it shows fraud.
It was shared on Nov. 30 by Ron Watkins, who has been peddling election fraud claims related to Dominion to his 328,000 Twitter followers. Watkins is the son of Jim Watkins, owner of 8kun, the website that spawned the QAnon conspiracy theory, which regards Trump as a crusader against an elitist group of pedophiles. Some of Watkins' election-fraud claims were included in a recent affidavit for a lawsuit brought by Lin Wood, an Atlanta-area lawyer who has also promoted QAnon rhetoric.
When Watkins shared the video, he included this text: ""Watch a Dominion Representative at Gwinnett County Election Central, responsible for tabulating ballots and certifying results, download data to a USB from the Election Management Server, plug it into a laptop, manipulate the data, then palm the USB.""
The right-wing website Gateway Pundit published Watkins' thread on the topic as though it were a news story.
But the video shows no such thing.
First of all, the person in the video wasn't responsible for certifying election results. ""Certification can only be done by the election board,"" Joe Sorenson, spokesman for Gwinnett County, told us in a phone interview. The Dominion contractor was there to help with the tabulating process.
As for what the video shows him doing, the worker was conducting a routine check of the number of ballots that had been recounted, Sterling, the voting system implementation manager in Georgia, explained in a phone interview with FactCheck.org. He was using a USB drive to transfer a report about a recently counted batch of ballots to a computer equipped with a program to read it.
""This is just part of the recount process,"" Sterling said, estimating that the procedure shown in the video might be done every hour or two.
We don't know exactly when the video was recorded or by whom, but it appears to have been during the state's recent recount. The cordoned-off section of the room where the recording was made was open to the public, Sorenson said.
The earliest version of the video we could find was on the QAnon-themed YouTube channel that Watkins cited on Nov. 30. A recount requested by the Trump campaign had started about a week before, on Nov. 24. It was scheduled to end Dec. 2.
That recount was the second review of Georgia's election outcome. The first review was a full hand-count audit of paper ballots that was conducted under a new state law and was completed on Nov. 19. The audit confirmed President-elect Joe Biden's win, and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, certified the results of the state's election.
After the results were certified, the Trump campaign was able to request the machine recount.
Raffensperger said at a press conference Dec. 2 that he expected no substantial changes to the final tally following the recount.
There were no substantial changes following the audit, either.
In Gwinnett County, where the video was recorded, Biden won 58% of the vote. That percentage didn't change after the audit, although Trump did pick up an additional 285 votes out of a total of 415,507 ballots cast.
Also, Sterling noted that the video appears to have been taken during the recount of the votes, not the original tabulation. So, if a worker manipulated the vote count at that point, there would have been a discrepancy in the numbers.
The suggestion that the video shows fraud that would favor Biden is false.

267.DoesIlluminatiSpelle,"
One of the most enduring conspiracy theories concerns the ""Illuminati,"" a name applied to any one of a number of rumored secret societies (some of them centuries old) that exist for mysterious purposes generally involving the manipulation of society and world events.
More skeptical folks generally reference Illuminati conspiracy theories in a humorous fashion (believing the concept to be at best implausible), while others maintain the amorphous, shadowy collective is responsible for much of what occurs on a global scale. Those who belong to the latter camp have voiced concern the secret society has frequently engaged in coded messaging, signaling (or sometimes taunting) those in the know with blatant displays of their vast and comprehensive power.
Since at least as far back as 2009, a seeming link between the United States government and the Illuminati circulated in the form of a rumor claiming typing ""Illuminati"" backwards into one's web browser navigation bar would lead the user to the web site of another conspiracy theory boogeyman: the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA).
Perhaps the largest similarity between the Illuminati and the NSA is one is an opaque, secretive-yet-powerful organization with the power to wreak havoc on your life if you displease its operatives ... and the other is the Illuminati. Joking aside, the rumor was indeed true in its basics: typing ""Itanimulli.com"" into a browser does redirect users to the NSA's web site.  
Rumors about satanic, occult, or secret society messaging hidden in facets of popular culture are not new and have circulated steadily for decades. The overall theme of hiding in plain sight is a common one in conspiracy lore, possibly because the ability to detect such grand-scale malevolence provides a measure of reassurance about that which we cannot control or resist. 
Of course, one might reason if a conspiracy on such a scale existed, its architects would be reluctant to leave such a clear trace on the Internet (and would at least attempt to cover up the evidence when word got out). Although the NSA faced perhaps its largest challenge following the revelations about a U.S. global surveillance apparatus made by former contractor Edward Snowden in 2013, this curious website function far predates that particular controversy.
As it turns out, the Itanimulli domain wasn't that hard to explain. It's a simple feat for anyone to register any unused domain name and redirect those who visit it to any other web site. Domain name owners can easily mask their identities, but that's not the case with Itanimulli.com: the individual who registered the site in 2002 was listed in publicly available domain registry information as John Fenley of Provo, Utah.  Fenley explained in 2009 he chose to forward the itanimulli.com domain (which he had purchased years earlier) to the NSA's web site on a lark, nothing more, and had no connection with that agency:

I decided to forward the domain Itanimulli.com domain to the NSA as a joke ... kind of like a rickroll + shock site. I registered the website years ago precisely because it does spell Illuminati backwards, but didn't really do anything with it for a long time. When I had the idea to forward the domain to the NSA I couldn't pass it up, and couldn't stop laughing ...
I don't believe that the Illuminati actually exists, and only one black helicopter has ever buzzed my house (that's a whole other story). I'm not sure what the New World Order Plan is, but if you have more information, I'll gladly tell you what I think of it.
I am not an employee of the NSA or DARPA, though I have participated in several DARPA contests including the 2 Grand Challenges, the Urban Challenge and the recent Network Challenge.

Although the redirection of the itanimulli.com domain to the nsa.gov website was eventually dismantled after this article was published, it has since been re-enabled.

250.JadeHelmConcludes,"


NEWS:   The conspiracy-fraught military exercise dubbed Jade Helm 15 has officially ended, without heralding martial law or a hostile takeover of Texas.      
In early 2015, conspiracy theories about the U.S. domestic military exercises known as Jade Helm (or Jade Helm 15) inspired a flurry of rumors on the Internet, such as this early iteration of rumor:
Many people both in and out of the media have assumed that ""Jade Helm"" was to be a training exercise to test and develop tactics to protect the Southwest from an invasion by a foreign government, drug cartels, or possibly terrorist organization. However, the Operational Plan for the exercise clearly shows that this drill is about the implementation of martial law and the subsequent pacification and subjugation of the American people by their government.
By mid-March 2015, Jade Helm conspiracy rumors became a nuisance for the military; on that date, military news source Stars and Stripes published an article titled ""Army Special Operations Command Pushes Back Against Alarmist Claims About Upcoming Exercise"" in which U.S. Army Lt. Col. Mark Lastoria attempted to dispel the increasingly widespread scuttlebutt:
""That notion was proposed by a few individuals who are unfamiliar with how and why USASOC conducts training exercises,"" he said in an email. ""This exercise is routine training to maintain a high level of readiness for Army Special Operations Forces because they must be ready to support potential missions anywhere in the world on a moment's notice.""
He said the only thing unique about this particular exercise, which is slated to take place between July 15 and Sept. 15, is ""the use of new challenging terrain"" which was chosen because it is similar to conditions special operations forces operate in overseas.
In April 2015, the Jade Helm rumors were partially catalyzed by speculation over the sudden and concurrent closure of several Walmart stores in states named in the exercise. Those rumors intensified when Walmart claimed the affected locations had been closed (abruptly and simultaneously) due to ""plumbing problems."" Social media users began sharing photographs they claimed depicted sinister Jade Helm activities:

4/21/2015 - Warner, OK @ 1:28am - Headed to Texas via 1-40 - Navy #JADEHELM15 pic.twitter.com/SGYtZeTqve
-- #JADEHELM15 (@JadeHelm15Intel) April 21, 2015
 
Lt. Col. Lastoria's reassurances didn't do much to quell growing fear of Jade Helm (particularly in Texas), and on 27 April 2015 he spoke at a contentious town hall meeting in Bastrop, Texas. The following day, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott arguably validated (and mainstreamed) those concerns via Twitter:

I've ordered the Texas State Guard to monitor Jade Helm 15 to safeguard Texans' constitutional rights, private property & civil liberties
-- Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) April 28, 2015
 
On the same date, Gov. Abbott sent a letter outlining his concerns about Jade Helm and its potential effects on his constituents. Rumors of near-operational Jade Helm camps subsequently sprang up, and an unrelated rumor about natural disasters was sucked into the by-then wide-ranging conspiracy stew (alongside a separate claim involving a comet).
Predictably fake news sites wanted in on the fearmongering as well, claiming Texans were forcibly implanted with microchips and that exercises in the state had claimed one of what would be several civilian casualties. Eventually, the Jade Helm panic became so dramatic it was virtually impossible to tell expressions from genuine conspiracists apart from parodies of them. By August 2015, reports circulated claiming shots had been fired at Camp Shelby (one of the locations at which Jade Helm exercises took place):
Jade Helm has been underway for nearly a month, and so far none of their predictions have come true. The operation has gone largely unnoticed, though news outlets have reported on troop movements and other drills in Texas, Mississippi and other states in recent weeks and a man was arrested last week for allegedly shooting at trainees near Camp Shelby, a short drive from Hattiesburg, Mississippi.
Compared to the months-long buildup of conspiracy rumors, the fanfare-free conclusion of Jade Helm 15 on 14 September 2015 was a relative let-down:
The exercise will end quietly Tuesday, however. Carried out in parts of Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana and Florida, it will conclude after two months of operations, said Suzanne Nagl, a spokeswoman for Army Special Operations Command, which oversaw it.
""At this time, we do not have any lessons learned to share since we have not yet conducted an after-action review of the exercise, but we do believe the exercise overall was a success,"" Nagl said in an email.
The military has routinely held training exercises like Jade Helm in the past. But this one took on a life of its own before it even began. An informational meeting attended by citizens and local government officials in Bastrop, Texas, in April generated national attention after several people accused the federal government of preparing for a takeover.
Twitter users expressed opinions about the conspiracy's reach:

Public Service Announcement: Jade Helm 15 is officially over. Texas is still Texas. There was no military takeover. Carry on.

Although the intent and scope of Jade Helm appeared to have been widely exaggerated by the rumors' proponents, at least one lasting effect was measured as it wrapped up: Texas State Guard recruiter David Childers ""described a 'substantial increase in interest apparently due to the Jade Helm announcement.'""

27.YouTubeRemovesVerifi,"
YouTube removed multiple channels named ""Fox News"" and ""Fox News Alert"" following an Oct. 1 Snopes investigation that found the channels were pumping out disinformation to millions of subscribers.
But these channels were not managed by or affiliated with the Fox News Channel. They had a combined total of millions of subscribers, and several of them even had YouTube verification badges. They likely received that special status in the past based on previous non-political content. Based on our own recent reporting of a similar network on Facebook, all of the YouTube channels appeared to be managed from outside of the U.S.
The YouTube channels in question posted lengthy videos from real shows that were broadcast on Fox News. However, the thumbnails for the videos were altered to push disinformation that falsely claimed U.S. President Joe Biden was either dying or going to jail, and that former U.S. President Donald Trump was coming back to the White House this year. This was similar to a debunked QAnon conspiracy theory that recently led to federal authorities worrying of potential violence from Trump supporters when such disinformation inevitably failed to come true.
Despite the verification badge and Fox News logos, this was not an official Fox News YouTube channel.
We found several different YouTube channels named ""Fox News"" or ""Fox News Alert"" that may have been managed by the same people. They were removed between Oct. 1-3, after we contacted a YouTube spokesperson for comment about our findings. A message was added to all of the accounts that were removed, saying: ""This account has been terminated due to multiple or severe violations of YouTube's policy against spam, deceptive practices, and misleading content or other Terms of Service violations."" 






A study of the Fox News clips that were posted to the channels showed that the videos likely received a combined total of at least tens of millions of views. This does not include views for other non-political videos on the same accounts.
While the channels above were removed, at least one remained. As of Oct. 4, the one channel that prompted our investigation was still available with its more than 883,000 subscribers. We were initially tipped off by a TikTok video. In that video, a TikTok user showed that he was recommended a video in his YouTube ""Home"" feed that came from a suspicious yet verified YouTube channel, ""Fox News Alert.""

 @lukerdookerspookerwooker
Lmao whatttttt #foxnews
  original sound - Likehat 

 
The YouTube channel shown in the TikTok video has since changed its name to ""FoBIRD,"" and no political content was publicly visible. It appeared that someone managing the account may have changed the visibility status of the political videos to be unlisted or private, as there was a clear discrepancy of tens of millions of views between the total view count on the channel's ""About"" page versus the total view count after we added up the numbers for all of the publicly visible videos.
A Sept. 17 archive from the Wayback Machine confirmed that the ""FoBIRD"" channel did indeed previously post political disinformation, as shown in the TikTok video. This credible snapshot on the Internet Archive preserved what the YouTube account looked like on that day, providing evidence of the conduct in which the channel had been engaged.
As of Oct. 1, a YouTube spokesperson told us it was investigating the channels. We will update this story if we receive further information on the removal of these channels.

287.KimMartinMorrowtheCEOofNetflixhasjustbeenchargedwith15chargesforchildpornography,"
If you've been binge-watching Netflix shows to get through the lows of the coronavirus pandemic, you might have been shocked to see online claims about the alleged criminal behavior of the company's CEO.
""Kim Martin Morrow the CEO of Netflix has just been charged with 15 charges for child pornography and 31,000 files have been found on his personal computers for child porn from ages 8 and as young as toddlers,"" reads the text of a post that has been copied numerous times on different social media platforms. ""So, I think the investigation was needed. #SaveOurChildren.""
The text often accompanies a link to a story titled: ""Sen. Ted Cruz calls for a criminal investigation into Netflix film 'Cuties.'"" 
The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Netflix's CEO has not been charged with these crimes. The claims have been debunked several times, but some social media users continue to spread the misinformation. 
Netflix CEO
First, the claim incorrectly identifies Netflix's CEO. Reed Hastings is the CEO and co-founder of Netflix.
PolitiFact searched news archives and found no evidence that Hastings had been charged with any crime.
It's not clear where the name 'Kim Martin Morrow' originated; our searches find it solely used with these inaccurate claims. Not one of Netflix's eight senior officers or 12 directors is named Kim Martin Morrow.
So why are social media users falsely linking a fake Netflix CEO to child pornography charges? That's a bit complicated.
Child pornography claims
The child pornography claims come after Netflix's release of the French film 'Cuties' was met with criticism from subscribers and other internet users.

By Bill McCarthy * July 5, 2022







Many say the film inappropriately sexualizes girls as young as 11, leading internet users to call for subscribers to #CancelNetflix.
Netflix has defended the film. 
""'Cuties' is a social commentary against the sexualization of young children,"" a spokesperson said in a statement to Variety. ""It's an award-winning film and a powerful story about the pressure young girls face on social media and from society more generally growing up -- and we'd encourage anyone who cares about these important issues to watch the movie.""
Film director Maimouna Doucoure, who won a directing award at Sundance for 'Cuties,' maintains that her film criticizes, rather than promotes, hypsersexualization of children. 
""I'm eager to see their reaction when they realize that we're both on the same side of this fight against young children's hypersexualization,"" Doucoure said of critics during an interview. 
The Instagram post we're checking also uses the ""SaveOurChildren"" hashtag, which is linked to the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory. QAnon followers promote the belief that President Donald Trump is working covertly to bring down a child trafficking ring organized by popular celebrities and prominent Democrats. The FBI considers QAnon a potential domestic terrorism threat.
But airing a controversial film is not a crime, and Netflix's CEO hasn't been charged with any, as the post claims.
Our ruling
Social media posts claim, ""Kim Martin Morrow the CEO of Netflix has just been charged with 15 charges for child pornography.""
Netflix's CEO is Reed Hastings, and he has not been charged with any crime. The claims appear to be the result of backlash over a Netflix film that many say hypersexualizes young children.
We rate this claim False.

A false story about a Zimbabwean inventor defying the laws of physics with an electric car that never needs to be recharged is re-circulating on social media.
The initial blog post was published in April 2018 on the conspiracy-fueled website Disclose.tv. It popped up again this month on Facebook and has been shared more than 25,000 times, according to CrowdTangle data.
This story was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The man who supposedly invented this vehicle, Sangulani Maxwell Chikumbutso, first appeared in headlines in the corners of the internet in 2015. At the time, his company, Saith Technologies, held an ""Open Day"" where he debuted his inventions and products, according to Zimbabwean technology news site Techzim.
The South African news channel SABC Digital News also covered the event.
All of the images on Saith's Facebook and Twitter pages are from that event, as are all of the pictures of the inventions the company claims to have created. Neither account has been active since mid-2015. The Saith Technologies website appears to have been taken down.
Chikumbutso claimed that his car runs on ""5 normal gel batteries."" According to an archived version of the Saith website, a secret substance is exposed to radio wavelengths, which give the car's ""power generator"" the ""capacity to funnel the power generated into functional electrical energy"" and never require a recharge.

Following the ""Open Day"" event, Techzim questioned the legitimacy of Saith Technologies products. It did not report on the company again.
Techzim noted that Chikumbutso's car was outside of the law of conservation of energy because it somehow converted 220 volt-producing gel batteries into a much higher output of 500,000 watts.
""We are not sure how this assertion can be dispelled and we hope at some forum scientist [sic] will put the claims to test,"" the article read.
The disclose.tv article says that the U.S. government ""recently"" relocated Chikumbutso to California to work on his inventions and that it might be to ""control this type of invention.""
There is no evidence that this happened.
Our ruling
Three years ago, a man at a one-day event touted ""inventions,"" including a car that defies the laws of physics. Since 2015, his story has only found a home on false news blogs and conspiracy sites.

37.QAnonFacebookGroupLi,"
Editor's Note: The Facebook Group was removed hours after this report was published on March 30, nearly five months after the company was first notified of its violent QAnon content. The removal was first noticed on April 22.
A Texas-based Facebook Group with a history of QAnon activity and that was connected to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot was still active on the platform as of late March 2021, despite Snopes repeatedly alerting the social network to the group's actions for over five months. The group was available to join despite the fact that the social media platform claimed to have a policy of removing groups that host QAnon content.
The Facebook Group is named Alamo City Trump Train. QAnon activity in the group has included posts where members displayed hashtags and attached conspiratorial signage to trucks. At least one post even sought to educate and recruit members into believing in the debunked conspiracy theory, a seemingly glaring violation of Facebook's policies. Another comment cited the QAnon conspiracy theory: ""Mobile bus of scumbag pedophile trash! Traitors to their own country!""
The group first made headlines in October 2020. We documented posts made in the group that showed it was used as a hub to coordinate real-time movements in an effort to ""block"" and harass a Biden-Harris campaign bus. The FBI was investigating the incident.
Facebook hosted real-time, coordinated movements that led to the harassment of the Biden-Harris campaign bus. 






The group also has a history of hosting violent rhetoric and harassment. In November 2020, members spoke of driving across state lines to travel to areas where presidential votes were being counted. They posted ominous messages about their future intentions. We reported this content to Facebook, but the company failed to respond.
One important day in particular when votes were being counted was Jan. 6, 2021, when members of Congress gathered at the Capitol to certify Electoral College votes. Many of the nation's representatives potentially could have died were it not for the quick thinking of law enforcement officers.
Ten days later on Jan. 16, The New York Times reported on a man named Keith Lee. According to the reporting, Lee had originally organized the Alamo City Trump Train Facebook Group's efforts that ended with the harassment of the Biden-Harris bus. Just over two months later, he cased the entrances to the Capitol on the morning of Jan. 6 and then spoke on his live stream to encourage Trump supporters to ""surround"" the building. During the incident, he held a bullhorn and ""called out for the mob to rush in, until his voice echoed from the dome of the Rotunda.""
The Times also noted that Lee had helped to fundraise and organize ""dozens of caravans to meet at the Jan. 6 rally.""
Despite all of this, the QAnon-filled Alamo City Trump Train Facebook Group was still active nearly three months following the Capitol riot.
Facebook did not respond to our emails.

56.IsChristineBlaseyFor,"
Dr. Christine Blasey Ford faced a torrent of personal attacks and conspiracy theories in September and October 2018, after she publicly accused federal judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, of sexually assaulting her when they were both high school students in Maryland in the early 1980s.
In late September 2018, a conspiracy theory emerged holding that Blasey Ford was closely linked to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and that her allegations were false and part of a CIA plot to block Kavanaugh's confirmation and disrupt President Trump's agenda.
One meme which spread the conspiracy-mongering read as follows:

If you believe this woman's story, consider this ...
Her grandfather, Nicholas Deak, was a well known CIA agent for decades.
Her father Ralph Blasey II ran three CIA-front companies Red Coats Inc., Datawatch, and Admiral Security Systems.
And her brother Ralph Blasey II [sic] once worked for the law firm Baker Hostetler which was behind the creation of Fusion GPS and subsequently the dossier used to start the Russian collusion investigation.
Get the picture?

 






Another meme emerged from a tweet and blog post published by conservative radio host Michael Savage on 27 September 2018:

WHO IS DR BLASEY FORD?
WELL, BESIDES BEING A ""PROFESSOR"" AT THE OFF BRAND UNIVERSITY, SHE ALSO WORKS AT A MAJOR UNIVERSITY DOWN THE STREET FROM PALO ALTO. SHE JUST SO HAPPENS TO HEAD UP THE CIA UNDERGRADUATE INTERNSHIP PROGRAM AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY.
CHRISTINE BLASEY'S BROTHER, RALPH THE THIRD, USED TO WORK FOR THE INTERNATIONAL LAW FIRM OF BAKER, HOSTETLER. THE FIRM CREATED FUSION GPS, THE COMPANY WHO WROTE THE RUSSIAN ""DOSSIER"". THEY LATER ADMITTED IT WAS ONLY A COLLECTION OF FIELD INTERVIEWS.
BAKER HOSTETLER IS LOCATED IN THE SAME BUILDING WHERE THE CIA OPERATES THREE COMPANIES CALLED:
RED COATS INC. ADMIRAL SECURITY SERVICES AND DATAWATCH
THEY ARE OPERATED BY RALPH BLASEY II. HE IS THE FATHER OF CHRISTINE AND RALPH III.
CHRISTINE AND RALPH III'S GRANDFATHER WAS NICHOLAS DEAK. FORMER CIA DIRECTOR WILLIAM CASEY ACKNOWLEDGED DEAK'S DECADES OF SERVICE TO THE CIA.

IS DR. FORD DEEPLY TIED TO THE CIA? pic.twitter.com/QcRLchqGGn
-- Michael Savage (@ASavageNation) September 27, 2018
 
The theory that Blasey Ford, in making her allegations against Kavanaugh, is acting on behalf of the CIA or as part of a CIA plot against him has three basic components:

Christine Blasey Ford directs Stanford University's CIA undergraduate internship program.
Her brother, Ralph Blasey III, once worked for a law firm which shares a building with three CIA-operated companies.
Blasey Ford's grandfather was Nicholas Deak, a CIA-linked currency trader and former U.S. intelligence agent.

This theory, and its component strands, were written about and promoted on several non-mainstream web sites during September 2018, including What Does It Mean, the BrassBalls blog, ZeroHedge, Before It's News, and in a segment on Alex Jones' InfoWars show (in which Jones claimed Blasey Ford and her family were part of the ""leftist arm of the CIA,"" whose function is ""to create transgender children,"" among other pronouncements).
On 17 September, WhatDoesItMean.com's ""Sorcha Faal"" outlined this somewhat complicated web of claims:

An intriguing in-depth new Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today states that a Stanford University Psychiatry Professor named Dr. Christine Blasey has become the latest centerpiece of a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) plot to harm President Trump with her last-minute allegation, just days prior to US Senate confirmation, that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had attempted to sexually assault her over 30 years ago when they were teenage school children -- while being kept from the American people about Dr. Blasey is that she currently oversees the CIA Undergraduate Internship Program Stanford University developed by the notorious CIA-connected Stanford University Psychiatric Professor Dr. Frederick T. Melges -- who himself, in 1985, took into his care the homeless woman Lois Lang who assassinated CIA paymaster Nick Deak -- and that afterwards saw the CIA's black operations monies being controlled by Ralph G. Blasey Jr. -- who, not so mysteriously, just happens to be the father of Dr. Christine Blasey.
 






WhatDoesItMean.com has a long history of fabricating evidence, quotations, and stories, as noted by RationalWiki:

Sorcha Faal is the alleged author of an ongoing series of ""reports"" published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don't think much of it. 
The primary audience of Sorcha Faal's reports and the only ones who take them seriously are usually other conspiracy theorists ...
Each report resembles a news story in its style, but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality (e.g. ""American Rebel Forces Attack Gas Pipelines, Explode Trains As US Civil War Nears"") and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service in the same article) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don't contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish.

The Stanford Connection
Stanford University does not operate or manage its own ""CIA Undergraduate Internship Program,"" but rather promotes that internship (which is operated by the CIA itself in Washington, D.C.) to its students, along with several other fellowships and professional opportunities, under the auspices of the university's Haas Center for Public Service.
Christine Blasey Ford is a research psychologist at Stanford, not a CIA internship program administrator. None of the posts claiming she directs, leads, or is in charge of the internship program provided any evidence to that effect, and none of them explained or acknowledged that the internship is an external one, run by the CIA itself thousands of miles away from Stanford's campus.
The Haas Center for Public Service lists four staff members responsible for advising students on internships and fellowship. including the CIA's undergraduate internship, and Blasey Ford is not one of them. This claim of a direct personal link between Blasey Ford and the CIA, via Stanford University, therefore falls down.
However, as an institution Stanford does have a history of working with the CIA, especially as part of Project MKUltra, a shadowy CIA-sponsored program in the 1950s and 1960s in which scientists and researchers, especially in the field of psychology, used drugs and other techniques to experiment with behavior modification and mind control.
Stanford was just one of dozens of universities, research institutions, and hospitals across the United States that served as venues for such experimentation, which was at times illegal and unethical for using human beings as subjects, sometimes without their knowledge or consent. (Famously, the ""Unabomber"" Ted Kaczynski was subjected to brutal psychological experimentation, suspected to have been part of an MKUltra sub-project, while he was a promising mathematics student at Harvard in the late 1950s.) 






In January 1973, CIA Technical Services Director Sidney Gottlieb -- the infamous poisons expert who oversaw the MKUltra program -- destroyed many documents relating to the substance of the experiments  upon the order of then CIA Director Richard Helms, the U.S Senate would later hear. However, in 1977 a Freedom of Information Act request uncovered a trove of material, mostly invoices and other financial documents, relating to the program.
Among that trove were hundreds of pages establishing the fact that Stanford University had been one of the dozens of institutions where MKUltra experimentation took place. The documents are now available on the web site of the university itself and indicate that MKUltra activities occurred at Stanford from around 1953 to 1964, with many of the orders and invoices signed by Gottlieb himself.
Ralph Blasey III
Here's how the BrassBalls blog explained this strand of the conspiracy theory:
Christine Blasey's brother [Ralph] used to work for the international law firm of Baker Hostetler. The firm created Fusion GPS, the company who wrote the Russian ""dossier"". They later admitted it was only a collection of field interviews. Baker Hostetler is located in the same building where the CIA operates three companies called Red Coats Inc., Admiral Security Services, and Datawatch. They are operated by Ralph Blasey II. He is the father of Christine and Ralph III.
This component of the overall theory is riddled with factual errors, fabrications, and logical failures.
According to his LinkedIn profile, Ralph Blasey III (Christine's brother, and the son of Ralph Blasey Jr.) did indeed once work as a litigation partner for Baker Hostetler in the firm's Washington, D.C. office.
But Baker Hostetler did not ""create"" Fusion GPS, as the blog post claims. Rather, in 2017 Fusion GPS told the Washington Post that they had performed some work as a subcontractor for Baker Hostetler, who were representing a Russian holding company in a money laundering case brought by the U.S. Justice Department. (More information about Fusion GPS' place in the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections can be viewed here.) 






However, Fusion GPS told the Post that their work for Baker Hostetler began in 2013, while Ralph Blasey III stopped working for the law firm in 2004, nine years before they engaged Fusion GPS.
Baker Hostetler's Washington, D.C. address is 1050 Connecticut Avenue Northwest. None of the three companies listed in the conspiracy theory as CIA fronts run by Ralph Blasey Jr. (Christine's father) has offices at that address. Ralph Blasey Jr. is listed as Vice President for Business Development of one of them, Red Coats, Inc., a Bethesda, Maryland-based cleaning company.
Admiral Security Services (which provides security guard and concierge services) is a division of Red Coats, and Datawatch Systems is owned and operated by the same people but located at a different address (albeit within walking distance in Bethesda.)
Ralph Blasey Jr. works for only one of those three companies, none of which shares an address with Baker Hostetler (the law firm which Ralph Blasey III, in any case, left in 2004) or has been shown by any evidence whatsoever to be ""operated"" by the CIA.
Like many other companies in the Washington, D.C. area, Datawatch Systems, which provides doorway and access security services, does have contracts with several federal government departments and agencies, as does Red Coats, Inc., and Admiral Security Services. However, none of them has a contract with the CIA.
This attempt to link Christine Blasey Ford to the CIA through her brother Ralph therefore fails on several fronts.
Nick Deak
Before we get to the substance of this part of the conspiracy theory, it's worth pointing out the profound logical flaw at the heart of it. The underlying premise here is that, if Christine Blasey Ford's grandfather was an intelligence agent, she herself must therefore be steeped in spycraft and have the same interests, temperament, and profession as her grandfather. Anyone with a different personality or career to that of their grandfather will instinctively recognize this assumption as nonsensical.
In any event, the claim here is that Blasey Ford's grandfather was the legendary CIA-linked currency trader Nicholas ""Nick"" Deak. Without offering any evidence of a familial relationship, the BrassBalls blog stated that ""Christine and Ralph III's grandfather was Nicholas Deak. Former CIA Director William Casey acknowledged Deak's decades of service to the CIA.""
Deak has been the subject of speculation and fascination for decades. In 1964, Time magazine called him ""the James Bond of the world of money,"" writing:
Born in Hungary 58 years ago, Deak holds a doctorate in economics, can talk money in five languages, used to work for the League of Nations. A naturalized American, he spent World War II as an [Office of Strategic Services] agent parachuting into Burmese jungles to search for Japanese prisoners. On a postwar assignment, he sneaked Hungarian boxcars past the Russian occupiers to help rebuild West Germany's railways. Deak still keeps in OSS trim with a vegetarian diet, daily sprints around his own suburban running track, and ski trips with his Viennese wife. From a paneled office (cable address: Deaknick) overlooking lower Manhattan harbor, he supervises more than 100 agents working for Deak & Co., one of the world's biggest dealers in foreign currencies.
In 1985, Deak was shot dead (along with his receptionist Frances Lauder) at his office in Lower Manhattan by Lois Lang, a homeless woman with a history of mental illness. Because of Deak's life-long connections to the CIA and a recent scandal which had implicated his firm in money laundering on behalf of international crime organizations, theories have been put forth that Lang was not merely motivated by her own delusions, as investigators concluded, but was acting under the direction of nefarious and organized forces, criminal or governmental.
In 2012, Arkadi Kuhlmann, who replaced Deak as CEO of his firm, told Salon of his own skepticism about the official account of his predecessor's murder:
""I never believed that the whole thing was random,"" said Kuhlmann, in an interview with Salon. Ditto the government inquiry that triggered the collapse preceding Lang's rampage. ""We were the CIA's paymaster, and that got to be a little bit embarrassing for them,"" he said. ""Our time had passed and the usefulness of doing things our way had vanished. The world was changing in the '80s; you couldn't just accept bags of cash. Deak was slow at making those changes. And when you lose your sponsorship, you're out of the game.""
Whatever the truth about the death of Nicholas Deak, one thing is clear: he was not Christine Blasey Ford's grandfather. Multiple news articles before and after his death stipulated that he had only one child, a son named Robert Leslie, also known as ""Les.""
This information obviously rules out the possibility that Deak was Blasey Ford's maternal grandfather, and since we know her father is Ralph Blasey Jr., we can say with certainty that Deak was not her paternal grandfather either. This eliminates the third and final component of the conspiracy theory, as articulated by Michael Savage and others.
Interestingly, the WhatDoesItMean.com does not claim that Deak was Blasey Ford's grandfather, but rather connects the two by way of another figure from a bygone era, Dr. Frederick Melges:

Though the American people were correctly told that Nicolas Deak assassin Lois Lang had previously been under psychiatric care, this report continues, what was failed to be reported to them was that Lang had been under the direct care and medical supervision of the CIA's own Stanford University Psychiatric Professor Dr. Frederick T. Melges just prior to her traveling from Seattle to New York City to carry out this assassination--and who was the exact type of assassin Dr. Melges had been working to create in his CIA-funded mind control MKULTRA programme--and whose Canadian victims of are still being silenced after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, this past December, imposed a gag order on them to keep them silent--but that does apply to Judge Kavanaugh accuser Dr. Christine Blasey, who remains able to teach her CIA Undergraduate Internship Program at Stanford University the MKULTRA mind control techniques discovered by Dr. Melges.

The claims that Lang had been treated by Dr. Melges, and that Melges was associated with the MKUltra project, was written about in Salon's 2012 account of Deak's death:
In August 1975, records show that Lang was discovered naked and catatonic in a Santa Clara motel room ... Police responding to the motel room took Lang to nearby Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. For the next month, she was put under the care of Dr. Frederick Melges, a psychiatrist associated with the Stanford Research Institute. One of Dr. Melges' main areas of research: drug-aided hypnosis. A few years after Lang was put in Melges' care, the New York Times exposed the Stanford Research Institute as a center for CIA research into ""brain-washing"" and ""mind-control"" experiments in which unwitting subjects were dosed with hallucinogenic drugs and subjected to hypnosis ...
The Stanford Research Institute received CIA funding, and Dr. Melges published work about using drugs and hypnosis to create ""disassociative states,"" i.e., induced schizophrenia. One of Melges' partners on these experiments was a doctor named Leo E. Hollister, who first dosed Ken Kesey with LSD as part of an Army experiment in 1960. He later admitted to author John Marks that he conducted drug research for the CIA ...
In other words, the doctor who cared for Lang in Santa Clara was a senior figure at one of the CIA's top institutional grantees. He worked side-by-side with a self-identified CIA collaborator, and conducted research into the kind of drug-induced behavior modification that the agency is known to have funded.
We were unable to verify the claim that Dr. Melges took Lang into his care in 1975, or what that treatment might have entailed. Frederick Towne Melges (known as ""Rusty"") was a psychiatrist from Battle Creek, Michigan, who received his medical degree from Columbia University before working at the University of Rochester and Duke University in later years.
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Melges worked at Stanford University, researching the perception of time. He conducted studies into the effects of cannabis and alcohol on time perception, personal perceptions of the future, persecutory delusion among people with acute mental illness, and several subjects related to human emotion. Some of his research involved administering doses of THC (the hallucinatory component in cannabis) as well as alcohol.
We were not able to verify the claim that Melges worked at the Stanford Research Institute, and it is unclear whether he ever took part in any MKUltra-related experimentation. However, even if one accepts for the sake of argument the claims made by WhatDoesItMean.com and Salon, no meaningful link exists between Dr. Melges and Christine Blasey Ford.
Melges, who suffered from diabetes, died at the age of 52 in Durham, North Carolina, in July 1988, having worked at Duke University since 1977. Blasey Ford got her undergraduate degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1988, then received a master's in clinical psychology from Pepperdine University in 1991, a PhD in educational psychology from the University of Southern California in 1996, and a master's in epidemiology from Stanford University in 2009.
She and Melges never attended or worked at the same university contemporaneously. The earliest record we could find of Blasey Ford's working at Stanford was in the year 2000, by which time Melges had been dead for 12 years (and had left Stanford more than a decade before that).
Even if Melges were associated with the MKUltra program, the fact of Christine Blasey Ford's attendance and employment at Stanford several decades later does not even come close to establishing a link between the two.

43.Whatdoourreadersquestionstellusaboutthepublicscoronavirusconcerns,"
Starting on the 16th of March, we gave our readers and site visitors the chance to share their questions about the new coronavirus. We wanted to understand what concerns them, and make sure that our efforts to tackle bad information about the coronavirus were addressing people's worries. In a little over a month, we received over 2,400 submissions. 
We were humbled by the trust they placed in us. And though we could not answer every question directly, we did take the time to read them carefully, group them into themes, and make sense of what matters to our audience. This is a summary of our preliminary analysis. It informs the claims we check, the fact checks we publish, and the policy work we do to foster a culture of accuracy.
Most questions were about behaviour, health, and transmission
The topic we received most questions (37%) about was around behaviour rules during the lockdown. Many members of the public asked us when, how, and how long someone should self-isolate for; or similarly, what exactly they were allowed, and not allowed to do, in line with social distancing recommendations. One variation of this topic in particular, revolved around caring for vulnerable elderly adults, as well as the management of families. Users in this case wanted to know if they could continue their co-parenting duties, if they could continue to see their partners, or even if it was safe to live in shared accommodation.
The second most frequent topic was of a medical nature (16%). Numerous questions here revolved around the interpretation of symptoms, but many of them also wanted to know how pre-existing health conditions shaped their risk of contracting or developing a severe form of Covid-19.
The final in our top three topics was transmission (12%) - questions such as ""can I catch coronavirus from"". The most frequent variation on this theme was around catching the virus from other people. Questions in this category asked, for instance, whether the virus travels in smoke from vaping, or from joggers running past. But many users were also interested in interspecies transmission from pets, transmission from deliveries or post, petrol stations, or clothes.
NB: These are not questions we can always answer. Medical professionals are best placed to address inquiries about health and susceptibility to illness, and the government remains the authoritative source for recommendations on behaviour rules during the lockdown. Nonetheless, the frequency of these questions did reveal one thing. Good information is not just about evidence-based recommendations. It is also about making those recommendations clear, evident, and visible enough to reach the public at a time of information overload.

False treatments
Around one in twenty questions (6%) asked whether a substance could be used to treat Covid-19 or conversely, whether it could aggravate it. Reflecting the intense media attention dedicated to Ibuprofen, the most frequent variation of questions about treatment was around this anti-inflammatory. Similarly, echoing speculations in the media around Hydroxychloroquine, members of the public also asked whether it, and other prescription drugs, could be used to treat Covid-19. 
There was also a suite of questions on alternative treatments and homemade remedies. Many members of the public asked about the effects of hot air and hot drinks, the possibility of treating Covid-19 with steam, alcohol, or even a combination of the two, or whether they could prevent it with vitamins and supplements, such as vitamin C. For instance, one reader asked this: ""Can a steam inhaler with a few drops of strong whiskey help to kill off the virus that is in the lungs?""
Conspiracy theories
We've also seen some questions around conspiracy theories (2%). Most members of the public who touched upon this asked questions about the origin of the virus. Some wondered whether coronavirus was produced in a lab in China or, conversely, whether it was an invention of the US. More recently, we have also seen questions about 5G.
An emerging picture
The topics covered here are just some of the main areas of concern expressed by our readers. They also asked factual questions about the origin, length, spread, and particularities of Covid-19 in relation to the flu, which we labelled as ""pandemic facts"", or questions about the collection of data about the number of deaths recorded, or the construction of forecasts, which we labelled ""statistics"". In equal measure, readers asked questions about the ""UK response"" to the pandemic, such as the administration of testing, their ""legal entitlements"", such as the right to furlough, as well as particular stories seen in the ""media"".
We are continuing to refine this annotation exercise. We hope you find these initial results useful as an indication of the types of questions we are receiving from the public. 
A note on methods
This analysis is based on an ongoing annotation exercise led by our research team. As with many annotation exercises, it is imperfect, and we are regularly working on refining the themes. It is also important to remember that this is not a representative sample of the British public.
Learn more about our research work, and the evidence on belief formation.

67.TheFalsehoodsofthePl,"



The first installment of a documentary called ""Plandemic"" stormed through social media this week, promising viewers on its website that the film will ""expose the scientific and political elite who run the scam that is our global health system."" The video appeared across platforms, with individual uploads each garnering hundreds of thousands of views.
But the viral video, running nearly 26 minutes, weaves a grand conspiracy theory by using a host of false and misleading claims about the novel coronavirus pandemic and its origins, vaccines, treatments for COVID-19, and more.
The video is largely an interview with Judy Mikovits, a former chronic fatigue researcher who has lobbed a number of accusations against National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci. Mikovits was an author on a controversial 2009 study linking a retrovirus to chronic fatigue syndrome that was published in the journal Science, and then retracted in late 2011 after labs were unable to replicate the results and other issues were brought to light.
That same year, in September 2011, Mikovits was fired from her position as research director at the Whittemore Peterson Institute in Nevada and arrested two months later after the institute alleged she stole a laptop, flash drives and other property with institute information. While Mikovits claims in the documentary that she was held in jail despite being charged with ""nothing,"" a criminal complaint from November 2011 shows she was charged with two felonies related to the stolen property. The charges were later dropped.
What followed was a years-long legal battle in which Whittemore won a civil judgment against Mikovits; Mikovits filed for bankruptcy; and Mikovits alleged that Whittemore defrauded the government by misusing federally funded research materials. The latter case was dismissed this year.
Mikovits recently co-authored a book with self-described ""anti-vaxxer"" Kent Heckenlively, with a forward by vaccine skeptic Robert Kennedy Jr., and has spoken at events aimed at discrediting vaccines. 
In the video, she claims, ""And they will kill millions as they already have with their vaccines."" It's unclear what vaccines she's referring to, but vaccines have been credited with saving millions of lives. For instance, according to one estimate by researchers with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, the measles vaccine has saved more than 20 million lives across the globe from 2000 to 2016 alone.
In the sections below, we break down eight of the false, misleading and unfounded claims aired in ""Plandemic.""

Unfounded Attacks on Fauci
Scientists: Novel Coronavirus Not 'Manipulated'
Misleading Claim on Wuhan Lab Funding
Flu Vaccines Don't Contain Coronaviruses
No Evidence Flu Shot Increases Risk of COVID-19
Hydroxychloroquine: Unproven COVID-19 Therapy
Wrong Message on Masks
False Suggestion About Ebola

Unfounded Attacks on Fauci
The first part of the video focuses largely on two sweeping, but unrelated, accusations against Fauci, who also has been a fixture at the White House briefings on COVID-19.
Without offering any evidence, the video claims that Fauci was part of a ""cover-up"" and that he worked with other doctors to ""take credit and make money"" on the AIDS epidemic.
Filmmaker Mikki Willis sets the tone for this section of the video, saying to Mikovits, ""So Anthony Fauci, the man who is heading the pandemic task force, was involved in a cover-up."" Willis, a former model, has a large following on YouTube, where he has previously claimed the novel coronavirus was ""intentionally released.""
""He directed the cover-up,"" Mikovits says. ""And, in fact, everybody else was paid off, and paid off big time.""
But at no point in the video does anyone explain what Fauci supposedly covered up.
We asked Mikovits in a phone interview to explain. She said it was a reference to her 2009 research paper that was later retracted. Mikovits holds Fauci responsible and claims it was part of a ""cover-up"" on the part of the medical establishment to keep hidden her research linking a mouse retrovirus to chronic fatigue syndrome. In the years since the research was first published, Mikovits has expanded its reach, suggesting that it could apply also to prostate cancer, lymphoma, and autism.
The NIAID funded Mikovits' initial research related to chronic fatigue syndrome, and, after she was fired, another researcher at Whittemore was awarded the remaining grant money. But there is no evidence that Fauci, personally, had anything to do with it. And the journal that published the paper made no mention of Fauci in its retraction. Rather, it explained it was ""fully retracting"" the paper because the results couldn't be replicated, even in the same lab, and ""there is evidence of poor quality control in a number of specific experiments in the Report.""
As for the claim about the AIDS epidemic, that goes back much further. In the early 1980s, Mikovits was working as a technician at the National Cancer Institute. She claims that the lab she was in had identified the HIV virus from blood and saliva samples and prepared a paper detailing those findings that was slated for publication.
But, she says in the video, referencing one of the pioneers of AIDS research, Dr. Robert Gallo, ""Fauci holds up the paper for several months, while Robert Gallo writes his own paper and takes all the credit.""
Mikovits could not provide the name of her lab's paper or the journal that was going to publish it when we spoke to her, so we couldn't check on that. But here's what we do know about the timeline for AIDS research in the early 1980s:
1981 - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published an article in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report describing a rare lung infection in five young gay men in Los Angeles. Fauci would later recall seeing that article, saying in a 2011 interview, ""I remember putting the issue to the side of my desk, thinking, 'Wow, what a bizarre curiosity.' One month later, in July, a second MMWR report came to my desk, and this time, an additional 26 men had it, again all gay, all seemingly healthy, and not only in LA, but now also in San Francisco and New York City. I remember reading it very clearly. It was the first time in my medical career I actually got goose pimples. I knew something was very wrong. It changed the direction of my career.""
1982 - The CDC used the term AIDS, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, for the first time.
1983 - A group of French researchers identified the virus now known as HIV. Twenty-five years later, Francoise Barre-Sinoussi and Luc Montagnier were awarded the Nobel Prize for that discovery.
1984 - A team led by Gallo at the National Cancer Institute published research showing that HIV causes AIDS.
Beyond the unsupported claim that Fauci -- who didn't become the director of NIAID until 1984 -- stymied early AIDS research at the National Cancer Institute, Mikovits also claims that he has profited from the epidemic.
Referring vaguely to patents, Mikovits says in the video that Fauci was working with other researchers ""to take credit and make money"" on the AIDS epidemic. It's true that Fauci's name appears on at least six patents related to AIDS research. But it's less clear how much he has profited from them. In 2005, the Health and Human Services Department was criticized for not disclosing how much government scientists were collecting from patent royalties. At the time, Fauci expressed concern over the potential for the appearance of a conflict of interest and said that he donated all of his royalty money to charity.
Scientists: Novel Coronavirus Not 'Manipulated'
Mikovits makes a claim that numerous scientists have refuted: that the novel coronavirus ""was manipulated"" in a laboratory and is not ""naturally occurring.""
""So it's very clear this virus was manipulated, these, this family of viruses was manipulated and studied in a laboratory where the animals were taken into the laboratory,"" she says in the video. ""And this is what was released, whether deliberate or not, that cannot be naturally occurring. Somebody didn't go to a market, get a bat. The virus didn't jump directly to humans. That's not how it works. That's accelerated viral evolution. If it was a natural occurrence, it would take it up to 800 years to occur. This occurred from SARS-1 within a decade. That is not naturally occurring.""
The exact origin of the coronavirus is not known, but scientists have said the genetic features of SARS-CoV-2 indicate it was neither created in a lab nor manipulated.
""Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,"" said an article published in Nature Medicine in March. Instead, the authors said it's plausible that the coronavirus originated in one of two ways: ""natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer,"" which refers to the spread of disease from animals to humans, or ""natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.""
The authors said the possibility of an inadvertent laboratory release of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ruled out, but they ""do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible"" because they had observed ""all notable SARS-CoV-2 features ... in related coronaviruses in nature.""
In a statement in April, University of Sydney professor Edward Holmes, who was involved in mapping the genome of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, likewise said: ""Coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 are commonly found in wildlife species and frequently jump to new hosts. This is also the most likely explanation for the origin of SARS-CoV-2.""
Holmes said there is ""unfounded speculation"" that a bat coronavirus named RaTG13, which was being kept at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, was the origin of the new coronavirus. But, he explained, that is not the case, for several reasons.
""In summary, the abundance, diversity and evolution of coronaviruses in wildlife strongly suggests that this virus is of natural origin,"" Holmes said. He added that more sampling of other animals ""is needed to resolve the exact origins of SARS-CoV-2.""
Mikovits also may give viewers a false impression when she says the novel coronavirus ""occurred from SARS-1,"" which is a different coronavirus that caused a global outbreak in 2003.
SARS-CoV, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, is similar but distinct from SARS-CoV-2. The viruses share about 79% of the same genetic make-up, but SARS-CoV-2 is even more closely related (96%) to the bat coronavirus from which Holmes has said SARS-CoV-2 wasn't derived.
We've already written about a bogus analysis that suggested the new coronavirus could have leaked from a Chinese lab because a portion of its genome is similar to part of a viral vector that was used in previous research on SARS.
Kristian Andersen, the director of infectious disease genomics at the Scripps Research Translational Institute, told us in an email that analysis was ""completely wrong.""
Update, May 21, 2021: The exact origin of the coronavirus remains unknown. On May 14 the journal Science published a letter from 18 scientists calling for ""more investigation"" to determine how the pandemic began. ""Theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable,"" they wrote. ""Knowing how COVID-19 emerged is critical for informing global strategies to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks.""
Update, June 29, 2021: Please see our June 25 story ""The Facts - and Gaps - on the Origin of the Coronavirus"" for a detailed examination of the debate over the origin of the pandemic. 
Misleading Claim on Wuhan Lab Funding
Also on the issue of the Wuhan lab, the video shows a clip claiming that ""$3.7 million flowed from the National Institutes of Health here in the U.S. to the Wuhan lab in China"" and that NIAID ""had already been conducting experiments with the Wuhan lab in the past in regard to coronavirus.""
That's misleading.
The project referenced, as other fact-checkers have previously reported, is actually funding from NIAID to EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S.-based nonprofit that researches emerging infectious diseases. The project was done to ""examine the risk of future coronavirus (CoV) emergence from wildlife using in-depth field investigations across the human-wildlife interface in China,"" in particular the risk posed by bats, according to a 2014 description.
NIH records show the project was awarded nearly $3.4 million altogether. Most of the funding was through a five-year grant awarded in 2014, Robert Kessler, an EcoHealth spokesman, said in an email to us. The group was renewed for a second five-year grant in 2019 and received $292,161 -- but NIH recently terminated the grant.
Of that money, only $600,000 (from the first grant) was given to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Kessler said. The Wuhan lab was a collaborator that was pre-approved by NIH and the State Department, he added, and one that researchers used to conduct genetic analyses of the viruses.
""In each of nearly 30 countries around the world where we work, we collaborate with local institutions, all of which are pre-approved by our federal funders,"" EcoHealth said in an April 28 statement about the terminated funding. ""It's been EcoHealth Alliance's position for the past 15 years that coronaviruses present a clear and immediate threat to our safety. That seems clearer now than ever before.""
The group said its research ""aimed to analyze the risk of coronavirus emergence and help in designing vaccines and drugs to protect us from COVID-19 and other coronavirus threats. In fact, genetic sequences of two bat coronaviruses that we discovered with this grant have been used as lab tools to test the breakthrough antiviral drug Remdesivir.""
So it's incorrect, and also lacks context, to claim NIAID gave ""$3.7 million"" to the Wuhan lab.
Flu Vaccines Don't Contain Coronaviruses
Mikovits falsely claims that ""if you've ever had a flu vaccine, you were injected with coronaviruses.""
""She's wrong,"" Dr. Paul A. Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told us in a phone interview. ""That's not true.""
""This person doesn't know what she is talking about,"" Dr. Lee Riley, professor and chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us in an email, adding, ""I think this person is just seeking publicity.""
In an interview, we asked Mikovits what support she had for the claim, and she didn't provide any. She only said that flu vaccines are cultured in chicken eggs and dog kidney cells, and those animals have coronaviruses. It's an extreme leap to then claim animal strains of coronaviruses end up in vaccines tested and approved for people. Mikovits further said she attributes the spread of the novel coronavirus worldwide ""at least in part"" to the use of the flu vaccine.
As we've explained before, coronaviruses are a diverse family of viruses, and some, such as canine coronavirus, infect animals. Those aren't the same as SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
As for influenza vaccines, most are made using hen's eggs, Offit explained, and about 10% of vaccines in the U.S. are cell-culture vaccines, which use mammalian cells instead of eggs. Specifically, the process uses Madin-Darby Canine Kidney, or MDCK, cells.
""These lines have been around for a long time,"" Offit said. ""This is a well-tested ... cell line that does not contain coronavirus"" and ""would never be allowed to.""
On its website, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more information on how egg-based and cell-based influenza vaccines are manufactured. A cell-based method that also used eggs at the beginning of the process received Food and Drug Administration approval in 2012, and a fully cell-based process got FDA approval in 2016.
The CDC notes that once vaccines are manufactured, ""FDA tests and approves the vaccines prior to release and shipment.""
This cell-based technology has been used in other U.S. vaccines, ""including vaccines for rotavirus, polio, smallpox, hepatitis, rubella and chickenpox,"" the CDC says.
No Evidence Flu Shot Increases Risk of COVID-19
Mikovits also repeats the unsubstantiated claim that ""the flu vaccines increase the odds by 36% of getting COVID-19,"" which we've previously covered.
Experts say that there has been no study linking the flu shot to elevated risk for the novel coronavirus. The military study cited by Mikovits involved four types of seasonal coronaviruses that cause common colds, not SARS-CoV-2.
More than that, the results in the study that indicate a flu-vaccinated person had an increased likelihood of testing positive for a seasonal coronavirus do not appear to be adjusted for age groups or seasons. Those factors could affect someone's chances of getting a specific virus, regardless of whether or not they've been vaccinated for the flu.
Multiple scientists have pointed out the same issue in other fact-checks, too, and have debunked the erroneous suggestion that the study looked at SARS-CoV-2.
The Military Health System told us in a statement that ""the study does not show or suggest that influenza vaccination predisposes in any way, the potential for infection with the more severe forms of coronavirus, such as COVID-19."" MHS further said ""it remains essential for people to obtain the seasonal flu shot each year as it becomes available.""
Hydroxychloroquine: Unproven COVID-19 Therapy
The video makes the unsubstantiated claim that the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine is ""the most effective medication to treat"" COVID-19, citing a survey of doctors.
Shortly after that, Mikovits says hydroxychloroquine is ""effective against these families of viruses,"" referring to the family of coronaviruses, such as COVID-19, but ""they keep it from the people.""
We have covered this ground before when President Donald Trump encouraged the off-label use of chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 patients. Both drugs are used to treat malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.
But there is only limited evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective for COVID-19, and it carries potential health risks.
The National Institutes of Health says there is ""insufficient clinical data to recommend either for or against using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.""
Despite insufficient clinical data, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization, or EUA, order on March 28 that allowed for the drugs to be used as a treatment for some hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
A little less than a month later, the FDA issued a warning against using ""hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for COVID-19 outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial due to risk of heart rhythm problems."" The warning came a few days after a study found that patients at Veterans Health Administration medical centers treated with hydroxychloroquine had an increased mortality risk compared with those that were not treated with the drug.
In the video, Mikovits says, ""The AMA was saying doctors will lose their license if they use hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malarial drug that's been on the list of essential medicine worldwide for 70 years. Dr. Fauci calls that 'anecdotal.' It's not storytelling if we have thousands of pages of data saying it's effective against these families of viruses. This is essential medicine and they keep it from the people.""
It's not true that the American Medical Association told doctors they ""will lose their license if they use hydroxychloroquine"" for COVID-19. The AMA issued a statement saying it opposed ""purchasing excessive amounts"" of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for possible COVID-19 treatment. But it also said, ""Novel off-label use of FDA-approved medications is a matter for the physician's or other prescriber's professional judgment.""
As for hydroxychloroquine's effectiveness against coronaviruses, we have written that at least two studies show that it has antiviral activity against the novel coronavirus in cells grown in the lab. But there is only anecdotal evidence that the drug works in people.
Trump cited in a tweet the results of a small clinical trial in France, but the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, which publishes the journal in which the study appeared, later issued a statement that said ""the article does not meet the Society's expected standard, especially relating to the lack of better explanations of the inclusion criteria and the triage of patients to ensure patient safety.""
We cover this more extensively in our story ""Trump Hypes Potential COVID-19 Drugs, But Evidence So Far Is Slim.""
Wrong Message on Masks
In attacking public health measures taken to address the pandemic in the U.S., Mikovits wrongly suggests that using masks could lead to people infecting themselves with their own breath. ""Wearing the mask literally activates your own virus,"" Mikovits said. ""You're getting sick from your own reactivated coronavirus expressions and if it happens to be SARS-CoV-2, then you've got a big problem.""
Experts were perplexed by what she meant and said the implication that simply breathing through a mask could lead to self-infection doesn't square with science.
Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech who studies airborne disease transmission, told us: ""If you're shedding (breathing out) virus, then you're already infected. Even without a mask, infected people who are shedding virus probably rebreathe some of their own viruses, but there are already billions times more viruses in your body. Hopefully, the mask is protecting other people from your exhalations.""
And Lisa Brosseau, an expert on respiratory protection and infectious diseases and a certified industrial hygienist, said in an email that ""viruses are not 'activated' by anything,"" as Mikovits suggests.
Viruses instead ""require living cells in order to replicate,"" but their viability or ability to replicate isn't affected whether someone is wearing a mask or not, said Brosseau, a former professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. If anything, viruses in the environment can be ""rendered non-viable by exposure to certain temperature"" and relative humidity conditions. 
""There is nothing magical about our breath that 'activates' or 'reactivates' a virus,"" Brosseau said.
As we've previously written, while there is little research on cloth masks, the hope is that they can help prevent individuals, even those who do not feel sick, from unknowingly spreading COVID-19 to others. Brosseau said people should frequently wash cloth masks, though, and stressed that masks are not a substitute for social distancing. The CDC notes the same.
False Suggestion About Ebola
Mikovits says in the video: ""In 1999, I was working in Fort Detrick ... and my job was to teach Ebola how to infect human cells without killing them. Ebola couldn't infect human cells until we took it in the laboratories and taught them.""
It's not clear what she meant by that, and she didn't explain when we asked about her claim.
But the suggestion that Ebola, which includes six species of ebolaviruses, didn't infect people until 1999, or later, is false.
The first two species, Zaire ebolavirus and Sudan ebolavirus, were discovered after outbreaks in 1976 in Central Africa. Combined, those two viruses, which scientists believe may have come from bats or nonhuman primates (such as chimpanzees, apes, monkeys, etc.), killed about 430 people that year, according to the CDC.
Zaire ebolavirus -- which is also linked to the largest Ebola outbreak which began in West Africa in 2014 -- is said to have initially spread in 1976 through the use of contaminated needles and syringes at a hospital in the village where the first infected person was treated. And the Sudan ebolavirus is believed to have started with workers in a cotton factory.
In fact, the CDC says four of the six species of ebolavirus -- Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, Tai Forest ebolavirus (formerly Cote d'Ivoire ebolavirus) and Bundibugyo ebolavirus -- are known to cause disease in people. And three of the four species were discovered prior to 1999.
A fifth species, Reston ebolavirus, was first discovered in 1989 in research monkeys imported into the U.S. from the Philippines. That species ""is known to cause disease in nonhuman primates and pigs, but not in people,"" the CDC says. There have been cases in which individuals developed Reston ebolavirus antibodies, but did not experience symptoms.
The sixth species, Bombali ebolavirus, was discovered in 2018 in a bat in Sierra Leone. It also is not known to infect humans.

57.FBICompletesIntervie,"
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI has finished interviewing a friend of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh who was said to have attended a high school gathering in the early 1980s where a woman says she was sexually assaulted by Kavanaugh, the man's lawyer said Tuesday.
Mark Judge, who has denied any wrongdoing, completed his interview with FBI agents as part of the reopened background investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh, said his lawyer, Barbara ""Biz"" Van Gelder.
She declined to say exactly when it ended or what Judge was asked. She had said Monday night that the interview was not completed.
Democrats, meanwhile, were raising new questions about the truthfulness of Kavanaugh's sworn testimony to the Senate, shifting tactics against President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee as they await the results of the FBI's background investigation.
Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democrats' leader from New York, accused Kavanaugh of delivering a ""partisan screed"" during the Judiciary Committee hearing last week. He said Kavanaugh seemed willing to ""mislead senators about everything from the momentous to the mundane"" to ensure his ascension to the high court. 






""The harsh fact of the matter is that we have mounting evidence that Judge Kavanaugh is just not credible,"" Schumer said Monday.
Not so, argued Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, contending the Democrats are simply looking to ""move the goalposts"" to prevent Kavanaugh's confirmation. He pledged that the full Senate would begin voting on Kavanaugh's nomination this week.
""The time for endless delay and obstruction has come to a close,"" he said.
Kavanaugh's confirmation hinges on a handful of key Republican and Democratic senators who have not yet fully tipped their votes. One of them is Republican Jeff Flake of Arizona, who was greeted by hundreds of liberal protesters, victims of sexual assault among them, during an appearance Monday in Boston.
Flake and Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska were instrumental last week in holding up Kavanaugh's confirmation vote. They forced the White House to open a supplemental background investigation of sexual misconduct allegations against the judge.
The votes of the three Republicans and those of red-state Democrats Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota will largely determine whether Kavanaugh is confirmed.
Flake said he would ensure it's a ""real investigation,"" by the FBI as Democrats demanded that Trump give them a full readout of his instructions to the agency.
""It does us no good to have an investigation that just gives us more cover,"" Flake said. 






Heitkamp, meanwhile, noted that Trump himself called for a ""broader"" FBI investigation into the allegations. She said, ""I'm waiting to see what the results are.""
Kavanaugh has emphatically denied Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that he sexually assaulted her at a gathering when they were teens. He has also denied an accusation from Deborah Ramirez, a classmate at Yale, who said he exposed himself to her at a dorm party more than 25 years ago. A third claim -- from Julia Swetnick, who is represented by attorney Michael Avenatti -- accuses Kavanaugh of excessive drinking and inappropriate treatment of women at parties in the early 1980s. Kavanaugh denies that as well.
Democrats have seized most recently on Kavanaugh's indignant, emotional testimony before the Judiciary Committee to question whether he has the temperament for a lifetime appointment on the nation's highest court.
In particular, Democrats have homed in on his contention that the allegations against him are an ""orchestrated political hit"" funded by left-wing groups seeking ""revenge on behalf of the Clintons.""
Sen. Mazie Hirono, a Democrat from Hawaii, said, ""We're going to put a conspiracy theory believer on the court?""
Democrats are also questioning Kavanaugh's honesty, particularly over statements he made about his drinking in high school and college.
Kavanaugh testified that while he enjoys drinking beer, and often did so in high school, he never drank to excess. He lashed out at senators who asked if he had ever blacked out. In one notable exchange, he snapped at Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., ""Have you?""
Schumer said Kavanaugh was ""rudely interrupting"" senators in a way he'd never seen from a witness. 






Former classmates have stepped forward to challenge Kavanaugh's testimony about his drinking. Charles ""Chad"" Ludington, who said he was a friend of Kavanaugh's at Yale University and now teaches at North Carolina State University, called Kavanaugh ""a frequent drinker, and a heavy drinker."" But the White House released statements from two other Yale classmates Monday who said they never saw Kavanaugh black out or treat women with disrespect.
Pushing back on the Democratic attacks, Republicans said Kavanaugh had every right to be upset during the hearing.
McConnell mocked the questions from Democrats about Kavanaugh's drinking in high school and college. He said Kavanaugh was ""rightfully angry"" about the accusations, and he added, ""Who wouldn't be?""
Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana, a Republican member of the Judiciary Committee, said Kavanaugh has only been responding to Democratic attacks.
""He's on trial for his life, so is his spouse, so are his parents, so are his kids, and he got mad. Now they are criticizing him for getting mad. I think that's the height of hypocrisy.""
The FBI is expected to spend the coming days investigating the sexual misconduct claims against Kavanaugh. Senators have said they want the investigation completed by Friday.
Democratic Sen. Chris Coons said after speaking with White House counsel Don McGahn over the weekend he remained ""very concerned"" the FBI's probe would be too narrow.
Responding to those concerns, Trump said at a press conference he wants the FBI to do a ""comprehensive"" investigation and ""it wouldn't bother me at all"" if agents pursued accusations made by the three women. But he also said Senate Republicans are determining the parameters of the investigation and ""ultimately, they're making the judgment."" 






""My White House will do whatever the senators want,"" Trump said. ""The one thing I want is speed.""
Still, Trump slammed Senate Democrats during a campaign rally in Tennessee Monday night. ""If we took 10 years, they'd want more time,"" he groused.

06.MisinformationSurges,"
NEW DELHI (AP) -- The man in the WhatsApp video says he has seen it work himself: A few drops of lemon juice in the nose will cure COVID-19.
""If you practice what I am about to say with faith, you will be free of corona in five seconds,"" says the man, dressed in traditional religious clothing. ""This one lemon will protect you from the virus like a vaccine.""

                      False cures. Terrifying stories of vaccine side effects. Baseless claims that Muslims  spread the virus. Fueled by anguish, desperation and distrust of the government, rumors and hoaxes are spreading by word of mouth and on social media in India, compounding the country's humanitarian crisis.
""Widespread panic has led to a plethora of misinformation,"" said Rahul Namboori, co-founder of Fact Crescendo, an independent fact-checking organization in India.
While treatments such as lemon juice may sound innocuous, such claims can have deadly consequences if they lead people to skip vaccinations or ignore other guidelines. 






In January, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared  that India had ""saved humanity from a big disaster by containing corona effectively."" Life began to resume, and so did attendance at cricket matches, religious pilgrimages and political rallies for Modi's Hindu nationalist party. 
Four months later, cases and deaths have exploded, the country's vaccine rollout has faltered and public anger and mistrust have grown. 
""All of the propaganda, misinformation and conspiracy theories that I've seen in the past few weeks has been very, very political,"" said Sumitra Badrinathan, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist who studies misinformation in India. ""Some people are using it to criticize the government, while others are using it to support it.""
Distrust of Western vaccines and health care is also driving misinformation about sham treatments as well as claims about traditional remedies.
Satyanarayan Prasad saw the video about lemon juice and believed it. The 51-year-old resident of the state of Uttar Pradesh distrusts modern medicine and has a theory as to why his country's health experts are urging vaccines.
""If the government approves lemon drops as a remedy, the ... rupees that they have spent on vaccines will be wasted,"" Prasad said.
Vijay Sankeshwar, a prominent businessman and former politician, repeated the claim about lemon juice, saying two drops in the nostrils will increase oxygen levels in the body.
While Vitamin C is essential to human health and immunity, there is no evidence that consuming lemons will fight off the coronavirus. 






The claim is spreading through the Indian diaspora, too.
""They have this thing that if you drink lemon water every day that you're not going to be affected by the virus,"" said Emma Sachdev, a Clinton, New Jersey, resident whose extended family lives in India. 
Sachdev said several relatives have been infected, yet continue to flout social distancing rules, thinking a visit to the temple will keep them safe.
India has also experienced the same types of misinformation about vaccines and vaccine side effects seen around the world.
Last month, the popular Tamil actor Vivek died two days after receiving his COVID-19 vaccination. The hospital where he died said Vivek had advanced heart disease, but his death has been seized on by vaccine opponents as evidence that the government is hiding side effects.
Much of the misinformation travels on WhatsApp, which has more than 400 million users in India. Unlike more open sites like Facebook or Twitter, WhatsApp -- which is owned by Facebook -- is an encrypted platform that allows users to exchange messages privately.
The bad information online ""may have come from an unsuspecting neighbor who is not trying to cause harm,"" said Badrinathan, the University of Pennsylvania researcher. ""New internet users may not even realize that the information is false. The whole concept of misinformation is new to them.""
Hoaxes spread online had deadly results in 2018, when at least 20 people were killed  by mobs inflamed by posts about supposed gangs of child kidnappers.
WhatsApp said in a statement that it works hard to limit misleading or dangerous content by working with public health bodies like the World Health Organization and fact-checking organizations. The platform has also added safeguards restricting the spread of chain messages and directing users to accurate online information.
The service is also making it easier for users in India and other nations to use its service to find information about vaccinations.
""False claims can discourage people from getting vaccines, seeking the doctor's help, or taking the virus seriously,"" Fact Crescendo's Namboori said. ""The stakes have never been so high.""

19.MailbagGaspricesthew,"
Readers care deeply about Russia's attack on Ukraine and the humanitarian disaster that has unfolded. Their feedback reflected outrage over the killing and debates over the impact on energy prices and how America should respond. We got reactions to the false claims about Ukrainian bioweapon labs, and whether Russian President Vladimir Putin could be charged with war crimes.
Below, our readers' thoughts, lightly edited for length and clarity. Readers can email us fact-check ideas and feedback at [email protected]
Gas prices
Our fact-checks on the price of gasoline, the Keystone XL pipeline and anything tied to the rising cost of energy drew many comments. Not all of them hewed to the facts.
One reader said: ""Gas prices are going up because OPEC and our oil companies have reduced the supply of crude oil while demand is rising, and they can price fuel almost as high as they want because they know people must have it to go to work, or to school, or to the grocery store and home again.""
Another put the blame on ""canceling fossil fuel subsidies, canceling permits and leases in ANWR, canceling the XL pipeline.""
""Anytime there's a threat to inventory the prices go up,"" said another reader.
And another said: ""Seems like we could be energy independent in not only fossil fuels but the resources and manufacturing of green energy technologies if we tried. If we didn't just try to find temporary political benefit or blame."" 
Let's recap some of our key findings on the rising price of gasoline.
Russia's attack on Ukraine led to sanctions that cut off U.S. oil purchases from Russia. The war alone isn't driving up prices. They were rising earlier as the world economy recovered from the pandemic slow down. Supply did not keep up with demand, and that pushed prices higher.
See our fuller explanation here.
On the Keystone XL pipeline, we found that under the best scenario, the pipeline was years away from completion, there was no certainty that the pipeline could have produced a net increase of 800,000 barrels a day, rather than just carrying oil from Canada that is currently being transported some other way, and producers had no obligation to sell that oil to U.S. refiners.
As for oil production, the numbers show that they've been on par with the levels during the Trump administration, and are on track to reach an historic high in 2023.
You can browse all of our recent coverage on energy here.
Ukraine and bioweapons labs
The day after Russia launched its assault on Ukraine, social media posts carried the false claim that President Vladimir Putin was targeting U.S.-run biological weapons labs in Ukraine. Some readers didn't accept our findings that Ukraine has no biological weapon program, nor is the U.S. funding the labs that such an effort would require.
""Our government obviously paid off PolitiFact to say what they want us to hear,"" wrote one reader. 
""Make sure you find a reliable media source 'cause mainstream media will not report the truth to what's going on,"" said another.
Whether it was Russia, China or Fox News' Tucker Carlson saying the U.S. backed bioweapon labs in Ukraine, we found no evidence to back it up. What we did find was about a dozen well-known public health and veterinary research labs doing the sort of work that takes place around the world. They work with dangerous pathogens, because those are the sorts of hazards that can kill people and livestock. The U.S. and other countries help pay for that work.
While the U.S. may provide funding to upgrade or build labs in other countries, the labs are run by those countries themselves, and the program's goal is to prevent biological threats, not create them.
One reader wrote to express his thanks: ""I know it seems niche at times but your work is one of the only published sources I've seen speaking out against some of the misinformation that is misleading naive people everyday.""
""I have close family members who are totally consumed with the information that you write against in your article regarding the Ukrainian biolabs.They're obsessed with that entire source and it's beyond frustrating, but also beyond logical rational behavior.""
One reader's criticism brought up an important detail.
""First PolitiFact said there were absolutely no bio labs in Ukraine. Now they are changing their story and saying no bio weapons labs. How can anyone trust anything Politifact says?""
For full context, we encourage people to read our articles, not just the headlines. 
Putin and war crimes
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has flouted international law more dramatically than almost any other military incursion since the end of World War II. We asked experts in foreign policy, military history, and international law if he could be tried for war crimes.
""Why are we debating something so patently obvious that it's happening right in front of our eyes! Trust what you see,""  wrote one reader.
""Declaring war without a cause IS a crime. It is not defense. All war is criminal in its initiation,"" said another.
And a third asked, ""Wouldn't Bush be ahead of him in line? Where was our outrage during the slaughter of Iraq?""
The International Criminal Court opened an investigation on Feb. 28 involving war crimes and crimes against humanity related to the invasion of Ukraine. 
Stacey Abrams' claim on Texas ballot denial
We gave a Half True rating to Stacey Abrams' claim that in Texas, ""a 95-year-old World War II veteran is being denied the right to vote by mail because he can't produce a registration number he got back in the 1950s.""
Abrams is a Democrat running to be governor of Georgia. The veteran she mentioned did have his mail-in ballot application rejected twice, but by the time she spoke, the problem was nearly resolved.
""You may mark her comment Half True but the new hurdles for someone already on voter rolls is real and true. This is the definition of voter suppression. 'Free and fair elections are the foundation of every healthy democracy, ensuring that government authority derives from the will of the people,'"" said one reader.
Another reader asked, ""How many other Texans in a similar situation have no one to help them navigate all the hoops necessary in order to solve this problem before the deadline to request a mail-in ballot on Feb. 18?""
Biden and the gun liability law
We rated False President Joe Biden's State of the Union claim that a liability shield ""makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can't be sued, the only one."" Congress has passed other laws that protect a variety of business sectors from lawsuits in certain situations, so this type of law isn't unique to the gun industry.
One reader said ""You're citing gun dealers, not gun manufacturers. BIG difference. If a toy hurts kids, the manufacturer should be primarily held liable, not Target.""
The 2005 law does protect both firearm manufacturers and dealers. The bill reads: ""The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) is a United States law which protects firearms manufacturers and dealers from being held liable when crimes have been committed with their products."" 
COVID-19, Fauci and changing recommendations on masks
We explored the persistent belief that the nation's top infectious disease official Dr. Anthony Fauci lied about masks. Early in the pandemic, Fauci said masks would offer little protection. Several weeks later, as new evidence of how the virus spread became known, Fauci said masks were critical.
We looked at the changing findings of research, especially in the face of a brand new virus.
Reader responses were mixed.
""The people (who say Fauci lied) do not have a basic understanding of how scientific research occurs. Theories constantly change as information becomes available,"" wrote one reader.
Others were not so convinced.
""The problem is not that he directly 'lied' to anyone, it's that he regularly pushed theory as fact, knowing it couldn't be proven, which is inherently dishonest. Therefore, Fauci lied, people died,"" said one reader.
But another reader, while critical of Fauci, focused on the price of a flawed message.
""Fauci absolutely screwed up telling people masks don't work because he was afraid of a rush on civilians buying them. He should've just leveled with the public from the door and said 'look we don't have enough. We need to save them for medical personnel' because that initial lie gave conspiracy theorists and right wing grifters their original ammunition to discredit him.""
Claims of Clinton lying
A relatively obscure legal filing by the special prosecutor investigating the FBI's probe of Russian ties to the 2016 Trump campaign led some to claim that there was proof that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton spied on the Trump campaign.
Republican Florida Sen. Rick Scott said the filing showed that Clinton ""actually spied on the president of the United States."" We rated that False, because the filing didn't say that.
A commentator on Reddit said, ""Even as a Republican hoping she gets caught for what Scott says... that is not what the report claims. At least not what we've seen.""
And another Reddit user added, ""Even Durham stated that Republicans are reading more into his report than what he said.""

43.WasTrumpatCheyenneMo,"
In early January 2021, Snopes readers asked about social media posts falsely claiming that U.S. President Donald Trump had a stolen laptop belonging to U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and that he was at the Cheyenne Mountain military base in Colorado Springs, Colorado, viewing ""evidence"" on the laptop.
Although the claim spread on various platforms, it appears to have originated on Parler, the site favored by far-right extremists, until Amazon pulled Parler's web hosting on Jan. 11, 2021, due to violent threats posted on it:

If the text in the above meme is difficult to read, it states, in sum, that because of ""evidence"" on Pelosi's laptop viewed by Trump, Pelosi had headed to the ""border"" (unclear which one) but was stopped just before midnight, and was being held at an undisclosed location ""pending tribunals and trials."" Because Parler is down, we don't know the exact date of the above post, but we know that it was posted shortly after the Jan. 6, 2021, pro-Trump Capitol riot, during which a laptop really was stolen from Pelosi's office.
It also states that Trump's conspiracy theory-minded lawyers Sidney Powell and Lin Wood were in front of a military judge and securing 195,000 sealed indictments that would lead to mass arrests. It goes on to warn readers that they should stock up on supplies to ""hunker down"" for 10 to 12 days while Trump installs a new government. 






The Parler post above appears to have been written by Ron Watkins, the administrator of the message board that hosts Q, the fictional prophetic figure in the Qanon conspiracy theory. The story spread on various other social platforms. But, it's not true. 
We'll first debunk the laptop conspiracy theory. Then the claim about Powell, Wood, and indictments.
One of the most widely seen images from the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot shows a rioter sitting in Pelosi's office with his feet up on her desk in a violent day that left five people dead. Congress was meeting that day to certify Electoral College votes for President-Elect Joe Biden.
Contrary to the idea that the stolen laptop was full of incriminating evidence, Pelosi's Deputy Chief of Staff Drew Hammill tweeted that it was ""only used for presentations."" And Pelosi had never headed to a border, only to be detained at an undisclosed location. She was instead at the Capitol and in the House Chamber the night of Jan. 6 to finish certifying Electoral College votes. On Jan. 13, 2021, she was again in the chamber, where she voted to impeach Trump for the second time for inciting an insurrection. 
Per Trump's public schedule, he hasn't left Washington, D.C., since the Capitol riot, save for one trip to Alamo, Texas, on Jan. 12 to visit the U.S.-Mexico border wall. There is no indication he visited the military base at Cheyenne Mountain.
There's also no evidence for the fabulist claim that discredited attorneys Powell and Wood, who had aggressively pursued failed court cases seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential election on behalf of Trump and made numerous outlandish statements in the process, had secured any indictments from any judge, let alone 195,000. We note that the weekend since the riot took place came and went, with no mass arrests of Trump's political opponents. Law enforcement, however, has commenced a nationwide manhunt for rioters who committed crimes during the Capitol riot.
Trump and his supporters for months have been aggressively promoting a disinformation campaign alleging the November 2020 election was beset by a massive scale voter-fraud conspiracy. These claims culminated with speeches by Trump and others given in D.C. at a rally that incited supporters to march to the Capitol in an event that ended with mass violence.
Trump's own administration countered the election-fraud claim, observing that the election was ""the most secure in American history."" Trump's political rival President-elect Joe Biden won the election and will be inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2021.

66.ANewsmaxhostshutdown,"
A Newsmax TV anchor walked off the set after his guest, MyPillow Inc. CEO Mike Lindell, started voicing unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and technology company Dominion Voting Systems less than 15 seconds into a Feb. 2 interview.
It's rare to see an anchor get up and leave during a TV segment, so the clip was widely shared on social media. It was the latest sign of the network's sensitivity to threats from Dominion to pursue defamation cases against people circulating falsehoods about the company's role in the 2020 election. 
Lindell, a supporter of former President Donald Trump who became his informal adviser, has claimed for months that the election was stolen. He joined Newsmax's Bob Sellers and Heather Childers, who asked about Twitter's recent ban on Lindell's accounts.
""Well, first mine was taken down because we have all the election fraud with these Dominion machines,"" Lindell said. ""We have 100% proof.""
Lindell seemed to be alluding to a baseless conspiracy theory that Dominion's voting machines illegally flipped votes from Trump to President Joe Biden. The machines were not designed to change votes, and there's no evidence they did.
Sellers shuts down Lindell's Dominion claims
Allegations of vote-rigging and election fraud were once common on Newsmax, a pro-Trump TV channel and website. In the weeks following the election, former Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell appeared on the network's programs to push such claims. So did Lindell.
This time, however, Sellers interrupted Lindell when he brought up Dominion. ""Mike, you're talking about machines,"" Sellers said over Lindell, who went on speaking even as his words became mostly inaudible. ""We at Newsmax have not been able to verify any of those kinds of allegations. We just want to let people know that there's nothing substantive that we've seen.""
""Let me read you something here,"" Sellers continued, turning to read from something on his desk. ""The election results in every state were certified. And Newsmax accepts the results as legal and final. The courts have also supported that view.""
Sellers tried to steer the conversation back to the Twitter ban and ""canceling culture,"" telling Lindell that he did not want to ""relitigate the allegations that you're making."" 
But Lindell continued. He accused Newsmax's anchors of suppressing him and vowed to reveal his evidence against Dominion in the days to come. Sellers asked his producers to end the segment, then got up from his seat and left Childers to close out the interview.

A screenshot of Newsmax TV's ""American Agenda"" after host Bob Sellers got up from his chair in the middle of a Feb. 2 interview segment with My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell.
""Newsmax and its anchor only wanted to make clear that it has found no evidence of software manipulation involving the election,"" Newsmax spokesperson Brian Peterson told PolitiFact. ""However, Mr. Lindell is entitled to his own opinion and has a different viewpoint than ours.""
In a broadcast the following day, Sellers attributed the spectacle to ""confusion"" over what the topic of the interview would be and said he could have handled things differently
Newsmax brought Lindell back hours after Sellers abandoned his interview to talk to host Rob Schmitt about his Twitter suspension. Lindell did not mention Dominion during that appearance.
""We wanted to make sure we had an opportunity to discuss suppression of free speech with him later in the evening,"" Peterson said, calling Lindell a ""welcomed guest on our shows.""
We tried reaching Lindell through MyPillow. The company did not respond to a request for comment. 
The looming threat of lawsuits
Looming over the on-air sequence was the fact that Newsmax is facing the threat of legal action from Dominion, which has filed separate defamation lawsuits against Giuliani and Powell seeking $1.3 billion over their claims about the company. That's key context for viewers who may have been confused when Sellers read what sounded like a legal disclaimer.
A similar episode played out in December, when both Newsmax and Fox News ran segments debunking their own coverage on Dominion and another voting systems firm, Smartmatic. 
On Dec. 19, Newsmax posted a statement to its website to ""clarify its news coverage and note it has not reported as true certain claims made about these companies"" by guests on its shows.
""No evidence has been offered that Dominion or Smartmatic used software or reprogrammed software that manipulated votes in the 2020 election,"" the network said. A Newsmax host later read the entire statement out loud during a Dec. 21 broadcast, as PolitiFact reported.
The statement came after Dominion demanded retractions and instructed Newsmax executives to preserve records on Dec. 18. A search of the TV monitoring service TVEyes showed more than 700 mentions of ""Dominion"" on Newsmax between the Nov. 3 election and that day.
In a pair of letters sent on Dec. 22 and shared with PolitiFact, Dominion's lawyers said that litigation is ""imminent,"" and that they were ""disappointed"" that Newsmax did not retract ""the falsehoods from its previous broadcasts and online articles.""
""Your failure to retract these articles removes any doubt that Newsmax is defaming our client with actual knowledge that its claims are completely false,"" one of the letters said.
Dominion also sent a cease-and-desist letter to Newsmax TV host Greg Kelly on Dec. 22
Proving that someone knowingly made or aired a false statement is key to winning defamation and libel cases, said Ryan Calo, a law professor at the University of Washington. The statement Sellers read may have been meant to guard Newsmax against charges that it brought Lindell on knowing he would make false claims about Dominion.
""Other than not inviting such a person on your program, you can inoculate yourself against lawsuits by disclaiming the content,"" Calo said. ""It seems like that's what they were trying to do."" 
For months, Dominion has fought baseless claims that it worked to change the election result, devoting an entire page on its website to addressing various allegations of fraud. 
PolitiFact has debunked several false rumors about the company, including claims that it flipped votes; that it was shut down; that it is owned by the late Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez; that the military raided a company tied to it; and that it counted votes in foreign countries.
No lawsuit against Newsmax has been filed to date, but a spokesperson for Dominion said the company is working to hold all responsible parties accountable for false claims that sought to undermine faith in the election, hurt Dominion's reputation and subjected its employees to harassment and death threats. 
""A lot of folks handed (Giuliani and Powell) a megaphone, and a very loud megaphone, on cable news shows and on the internet. And we are looking at each and every one of them,"" said Tom Clare, a lawyer representing the company, during a Jan. 26 interview with CNN.
Dominion's lawyers also sent letters to Lindell on Dec. 23 and again on Jan. 8 warning of imminent litigation. Lindell has said publicly that he would welcome a lawsuit, and Clare said Jan. 25 that he thinks Lindell ""will eventually get his wish.""

On March 14, 2020, ObamaWatcher published an article positing that the degrees earned by former first lady Michelle Obama at Harvard University were fake and that her transcripts had been altered to change her gender from male to female:
Harvard Admits Michelle Obama's Degrees Are Fakes
Supposedly, Michelle Obama attended both Harvard and Princeton Universities for her degrees before becoming a lawyer and professor. It was bafflement for many on how the former first ""lady"" obtained such high ranking degrees.
Now the truth is finally coming to light. She didn't.
This item was not a factual recounting of real-life events. The article originated with a website that describes its output as being humorous or satirical in nature, as follows:
Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.
In reality, Obama graduated cum laude from Princeton University in 1985 and then earned her Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Harvard Law School in 1988. The claim that Michelle Obama is really a man (hinted at in the fictional article) is an unfounded yet oft repeated conspiracy theory.

Satirists and purveyors of fake news went into overdrive in May 2018 after ABC announced that it was cancelling the hit show Roseanne. The decision came directly after a series of tweets posted by titular star Roseanne Barr containing racist language and a veritable melange of conspiracy theories.
The Facebook page for satire site The Last Line of Defense added its misinformation into the mix with a claim that ABC's Senior Vice President of Programming Mutafa Ka'Plese was a member of former United States President Barack Obama's ""Choom Gang,"" and that he was the one who ultimately made the decision to cancel the show:

There are several ways to tell that this meme was created in jest rather than as a genuine attempt to relay factual information. For instance, Mutafa Ka'Plese is a gag name (sound it out syllable by syllable) in the vein of Seymour Butts or Philip McCreviss. The photograph also doesn't show any of the higher-ups working at ABC. This is actually an image of singer Julio Iglesias at an event in Mexico City.
We couldn't find anyone at ABC with the exact title of ""Senior Vice President of Programming."" The Executive Vice President of Programming Strategy is Andy Kubitz, and the Senior Vice President of Current Programming is Stephanie Leifer. Regardless, neither of these people made the decision to cancel Roseanne. That honor belongs to ABC Entertainment Group's executive president Channing Dungey, who released a statement that made the reason for the show's cancellation extremely clear:
Roseanne's Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values, and we have decided to cancel her show.
Dungey's decision was supported by Disney's chief executive officer Bob Iger.

Supporters of President Donald Trump stormed and occupied the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. As the mob could be heard shouting outside the doors of the Senate, police escorted first Vice President Mike Pence and then senators out of the chamber. The intruders took turns posing for photographs at the dais. 
But online, another narrative is unfolding as some deny what happened and instead push ""false flag"" claims. (False flags are supposed covert operations designed to deflect blame. They are frequently the subject of conspiracy theories.)
""The moment we realized this is a staged psyop,"" someone tweeted, sharing a video of a Capitol police officer retreating as a mob of people walks toward him. 
Other social media users have shared an image of a man behind the dais in the Senate chamber with his arm raised. Standing above him in the gallery, a photographer is pointing his camera down. 
The photographer is circled and a red arrow is drawn pointing to another red circle around the man at the dais. 
""This look staged to you?"" reads the text over the image. ""Fist in the air classic Trump supporter signal, right?"" 
But text elsewhere on the photo seems to refute that illusion: ""NOT MAGA,"" it says.
""I have friends in DC now and they are saying don't believe the media,"" said one Instagram post that shared the image. ""Antifa is who stormed the capital through the back.

We've already debunked several falsehoods blaming antifa for what happened at the Capitol.  
We've also found that, contrary to rumors on both sides of the political spectrum, evidence so far has shown that Capitol Police were outnumbered and overwhelmed by the rioters and forced to retreat.  
To dismiss the insurrection as a false flag is to dismiss the testimony of dozens and dozens of lawmakers, government employees and journalists who were at the Capitol that day to cover Congress certifying the victory of President-elect Joe Biden. 
Rep. Patrick Fallon, a Republican from Texas, recalled on Facebook that ""the mob reached the actual doors to the House Chamber and there was visible concern on everyone's faces."" He described lawmakers breaking off furniture ""to make clubs to defend the US House of Representatives.""
Reporters were initially stuck in the gallery on the third floor overlooking the chamber, CBS News reporter Grace Segers wrote in a story about what it was like to be there.
NBC News reporter and producer Frank Thorp posted a video from the gallery showing intruders roaming the Senate floor and looking through desks.  
Jeffrey Rosen, the acting attorney general Trump appointed to replace William Barr, issued a statement on Jan. 7 saying that the ""nation watched in disbelief as a mob breached the Capitol Building and required federal and local law enforcement to help restore order."" 
Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund said, ""The violent attack on the U.S. Capitol was unlike any I have ever experienced in my 30 years in law enforcement here in Washington."" 
There is no evidence that it was staged, a psychological operation, or a false flag.

Don't expect a fast recovery from hoaxes and conspiracy theories about the coronavirus.
As of Jan. 30, the virus has spread to at least 18 other countries and infected more than 7,800 people. The World Health Organization declared it an international public health emergency.
As the situation develops, PolitiFact compiled what we do and don't know about the 2019 coronavirus. If you have a question about the virus, or if you see a questionable post on social media, send it to [email protected].
What's true
It's important to know that officials are still investigating the 2019 coronavirus, so you should be skeptical of sources that claim to have the full story.
Formally known as 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease, the current coronavirus was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in December. It is one of seven kinds of coronaviruses that can infect humans. 
Coronaviruses are named for the ""crown-like spikes on their surface"" and are found in animals like camels, cattle, cats and bats. Rarely do they spread from animals to people. Human coronaviruses were first identified in the mid 1960s, according to the CDC.
The 2019 coronavirus is a ""betacoronavirus,"" like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which come from bats. All of them cause symptoms like fever, cough and shortness of breath. 
The vast majority of cases are in China, where the WHO says there are 12,167 more suspected cases and 170 deaths. The country has imposed strict travel restrictions in and around Wuhan to try and slow the spread of the virus.
There are also confirmed cases in several European and Asian countries, as well as Australia, Canada and the United States (where there were five reported cases as of Jan. 30).

(Source: WHO)
But the likelihood of people in the United States catching the virus is minimal, at least for now. ""For the general American public, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus, the immediate health risk from 2019-nCoV is considered low,"" the CDC says in its risk assessment. 
The WHO lists several recommendations for reducing the risk of new coronavirus infections:
* Avoid close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.
* Wash hands frequently, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.
* Avoid unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.
* People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).
* Emphasize standard infection prevention and control practices in health care facilities and hospitals, especially in emergency departments.
What's false
Misinformation about the 2019 coronavirus falls into a few different buckets: hoaxes about the virus's source, conspiracies about its connection to biological warfare, fabricated information about its spread, and misconceptions about how to treat it.
Several early posts on Facebook and Twitter, as well as YouTube videos and articles, speculated about the source. They claimed there were already patents for potential vaccines or disinfectants to slow the virus's spread -- proof that the illness was created by companies or foundations looking for financial gain.
Those allegations are inaccurate. 
Some organizations, including the CDC and the United Kingdom-based Pirbright Institute, do have patents for potential coronavirus vaccines, but not for the strain spreading from China. There is no vaccine available for the 2019 coronavirus.
Other Facebook posts, YouTube videos and articles have concocted more nefarious theories. Some go as far as to say that coronavirus was developed in a lab as a ""bioweapon for population control"" and that Chinese spies stole virus samples from Canada.
RELATED: Fact-checking hoaxes and conspiracies about the coronavirus
There is no evidence to support those claims. 
While its investigation is still ongoing, the CDC has said the 2019 coronavirus appears to have originated at a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, China. Some conspiracies conflated the latest virus with MERS, while others fabricated claims about the Chinese government.
As the virus spread around the world, other social media posts started to speculate about its impact. Some conspiratorial websites claimed the 2019 coronavirus had killed 10,000 people in Wuhan, while others alleged that the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency had called on President Donald Trump to impose martial law.
Those claims are bunk. 
FEMA never called on the president to declare martial law, and 170 people have died in China due to the coronavirus, according to the WHO. 
Finally, some social media users have proposed a concerning way to prevent coronavirus infections: drinking bleach. Several tweets and now-deleted YouTube videos claim a bleaching agent, which has been touted by anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists as a ""miracle cure,"" will instantly ""kill the deadly virus."" 
Those claims are false.
There is no scientific evidence that drinking bleach will help cure or prevent any disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has released multiple warnings about the ""dangerous and potentially life threatening side effects"" of bleaching agents and urge people not to drink them.
What's unknown
Misinformation thrives when verified information is scant. Such is the case with the 2019 coronavirus.
Among the facts that experts are still ironing out: the original source of the outbreak, precisely how it spreads and how severe it is.
The source of the outbreak is particularly contested. Early reports focused on the fact that many patients were linked to a large seafood and live animal market in Wuhan. That suggested animal-to-person spread, according to the CDC.
Later, a growing number of patients reported not having any connection to the market. That suggested the coronavirus was spreading person-to-person.
Both Chinese authorities and the CDC have isolated the genome of the 2019 coronavirus. Their findings suggest ""a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.""

Some have speculated that a lab near Wuhan could be the source of the virus. The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is a maximum-security biolab that deals with some of the world's most dangerous pathogens, including Ebola and SARS. As of now, however, there is no evidence that the lab is the source of the outbreak.
It's also not clear how it spreads.
The CDC says the spread of MERS and SARS is thought to be caused by ""respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes."" That's similar to how other pathogens spread, including influenza.
However, experts aren't sure if the 2019 coronavirus can be transferred through other means, such as fecal-oral contact. They also aren't sure at what point the virus becomes contagious. The head of China's National Health Commission has said it could be possible to spread the illness before showing symptoms.
Then there's the question of how many cases there actually are. 
Officially, there are more than 7,800 people confirmed cases of the 2019 coronavirus worldwide. But experts estimate that the actual number of infected people is probably much higher. Complicating matters is the fact that China has a history of concealing disease outbreaks; in 2002, it downplayed an outbreak of SARS in the province of Guangdong.
""Newspapers were forbidden from reporting the disease, except for occasional statements from government officials assuring the public that there was nothing to worry,"" the Guardian wrote Jan. 23. ""Such was the obsession with suppressing 'negative news' that when a sick traveller from Guangdong arrived in Beijing, doctors there had no idea of what the illness was, and allowed it to spread in the city.""
One final unknown detail about the 2019 coronavirus is its severity. Many people recover within a few days, but some, such as young, elderly or immunocompromised people, may develop more serious infections, like bronchitis or pneumonia.
""The complete clinical picture with regard to 2019-nCoV is still not fully clear,"" the CDC says in its illness severity assessment. ""Reported illnesses have ranged from infected people with mild illness to people being severely ill and dying.""

Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.
In late November 2020, after U.S. President-elect Joe Biden secured the battleground state of Georgia in the presidential election, a social media campaign emerged claiming his opponent, U.S. President Donald Trump, would have a chance to serve in the U.S. Senate if enough people voted for him in the state's upcoming runoffs.
The Jan. 5, 2021, runoff election between incumbent Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue and Democrats the Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff will decide whether Republicans or Democrats control the upper chamber at the outset of a Biden administration. Georgia election rules call for runoff races when no candidate exceeds 50% of voter share in either race during the general election. 
But with the hashtag #WriteInTrumpForGA on platforms including Twitter and Parler, an online haven for conservatives, posts attempted to convince Georgia voters to write in Trump's name and elect him to the Senate, even though he was not a candidate. 
""We need to cover ALL bases in our stop the steal efforts, and one of these is simply utilizing our voice for the GA runoffs and writing in Donald J Trump for senate,"" read one Parler post. ""[We] can maintain a senate majority with TRUMP as the majority leader! We can put a STOP to the democrats!"" 






The underlying message of some posts echoed Trump's attacks on Georgia Republican state officials who oversaw the process for certifying votes in the presidential race. In tweets and emails to supporters soliciting donations, the Trump campaign called on Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to break state laws governing the democratic process and defy the outcome of the popular vote that awarded Georgia's 16 electoral votes to Biden. He won by fewer than 13,000 votes out of about 5 million cast.
Some Parler posts obtained by Snopes, such as the ones displayed below, lumped Senate candidates Loeffler and Perdue into that group of Republicans who were not acceding to the Trump campaign's requests to delegitimize Biden's win by spreading baseless allegations that Dominion Voting Systems software had altered votes.


""The president has basically taken hostage this race,"" said Brendan Buck, once a top adviser to former House Speaker Paul Ryan, per The Associated Press.
In short, some posts wanted Georgia voters to write in Trump's name to supposedly help him win a Senate seat. Meanwhile, others promoted the #WriteInTrumpForGA campaign not to necessarily elect Trump but to ""punish"" Loeffler and Perdue, since participating voters would, in theory, otherwise have voted for the Senate Republican candidates.
The assumption behind the former approach -- that Trump had a realistic chance to serve in the Senate -- was false, but the latter reasoning had some validity to it, which we explain below.
First, though, let us lay out laws governing runoff elections. Georgia is one of 10 U.S. states where statutes require runoff elections when no candidate receives more than 50% of votes in a general election. Per Georgia Code Title 21. Elections SS 21-2-501: 






""In instances where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, a run-off primary, special primary runoff, run-off election, or special election runoff between the candidates receiving the two highest numbers of votes shall be held.""
That means, per state law, all runoffs in Georgia only allow two candidates (the top two vote-getters in general elections) per race on ballots. So in the Jan. 5 Georgia runoffs, ballots allow voters the options of selecting either Loeffler or Warnock in one race, or Perdue or Ossoff in the other (see the sample ballot below).
There is no line allocated for a write-in option, no matter if people cast paper ballots or use touch-screen voting. 

An Attempt To 'Tilt The Balance In Trump's Favor'
Nonetheless, people in theory could still answer the social media campaign's request to write in Trump's name on ballots unofficially, perhaps in the paper's margins or next to the Senate candidates' names.
But that scribbling would not be an official vote for the sitting president (or anyone) for numerous reasons. Namely, as stated, Trump was not among the top two vote-getters in Georgia's Senate races, so the law does not consider him a viable candidate in the runoffs. 
Additionally, since the ballots do not include an official line for write-in candidates, writing outside of the bubbles for official candidates could force election officials to invalidate the paperwork all together, per laws governing the ballot-counting process. The statutes require poll workers to scan ballots for improper markings or other defects before they feed them into tabulation machines for official vote counts. As a result, spoiled or defective ballots are not legally counted in elections. 






Given that fact, opponents of Trump co-opted #WriteInTrumpForGA in attempt to help Democratic Senate candidates in Georgia. If a significant number of Republican voters wrote Trump on their ballots -- and, as a result, election officials had to invalidate their votes under state law -- the race's Democratic candidates could reap the benefit, and Republicans could risk losing a Senate majority.

That communications strategy to convince die-hard conservatives that voting for Loeffler and Perdue would defy Trump's political agenda (cryptically in the name of helping Democrats) manifested in other ways, too.
An anti-Trump political organization called ""Really American PAC"" was supposedly soliciting donations on ActBlue, a fundraising processor for Democratic campaigns, to pay for the billboards displayed below. At least one Twitter user claimed to have seen one of the signs in real life.
""If Trump supporters deliver Perdue and Loeffler a victory, they should be acutely aware that they will be delivering Trump and MAGA a serious political defeat,"" read a statement by the PAC.

A website, writeintrumpforgeorgiasenate.com, was also part of that tongue-in-cheek campaign effort, per an attorney for an opposing political action group. The website read:
 






""With enough write-ins in the Georgia senate race, we can tilt the balance in Georgia in Trump's favor! If we can do this, we have a real chance at getting these RINO senators to act on the illegitimate and corrupt election presided over by a Democrat party that is invested in the Communist takeover of Our Great Nation. ""
The site says it was funded by the political group ""Committee for American Sovereignty,"" which according to news reports was created in 2016 to help Republican operatives -- including Trump's longtime political confidant Roger Stone -- undermine Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign by spewing an unfounded conspiracy theory that Bill Clinton had an illegitimate biracial son.
The Daily Beast, however, reported that Paul Jensen, an attorney for the committee, refuted its connection to the website, and alleged its ""goal is to elect the Democrat candidate, suggesting that a Democrat-leaning entity, not the Committee for American Sovereignty, is behind it.""
Effects of Political Communication Schemes Remain Unknown
On Nov. 23, Donald Trump Jr. refuted the messages urging Trump supporters to abstain from voting for Loeffler and Perdue.

More than a week later, as Trump prepared for a Dec. 5 visit to Georgia to campaign alongside Perdue and Loeffler, the president echoed that sentiment, saying in a tweet ""we must work hard"" to ensure victories for the Republican Senate candidates.

In sum, the outcome of the runoffs remained unknown; therefore, it was unclear how any ballots, much less those with invalid markings for Trump, would impact results.
But if, instead of voting for Loeffler or Perdue, a significant number of Republican voters unofficially wrote Trump's name on their ballots -- and, as a result, election officials had to throw out those ballots-- Democrats' vote margins would benefit. Depending on the level of participation in that protest, it could undermine Senate Republicans' chance at securing the chamber's majority.
Nonetheless, state and federal laws governing elections would not allow voters the opportunity to elect Trump to the Senate in the runoffs. For those reasons, we rate this claim ""Mostly false.""

Tech companies are cracking down on accounts and services that they believe violate their terms of service or spread extremist messages and misinformation.
Parler, a social media platform popular with conservatives, was kicked off Amazon Web Services following the violent riot Jan. 6 at the U.S. Capitol. Google and Apple deleted the Parler app from their stores.
Twitter suspended 70,000 accounts affiliated with the QAnon conspiracy theory and booted the @realdonaldtrump account, while Facebook said it would remove ""stop the steal"" messages claiming election fraud and suspended President Donald Trump at least through Joe Biden's Jan. 20 inauguration. Google's YouTube video service also barred Trump at least until the inauguration.
U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., says the actions have left Republicans with ""no way to communicate."" Here's what he said in an interview on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" show:
""There is no longer a free and open social media company or site for any American to get on any longer, because these big companies, Apple, Amazon, Google"" destroyed Parler.
""Poof -- it's gone.""
He added: ""Republicans have no way to communicate. And it doesn't even matter if you're a Republican or conservative. If you don't want to be regulated by left-wingers that are at Twitter and Facebook and Instagram, where you get shadowbanned, nobody gets to see you.""
Nunes said he has 3 million followers on Parler. ""Tonight, I will no longer be able to communicate with those people,"" he said in the segment.
Amazon cited violent content when it shut off Parler's access to its cloud service. Parler sued Amazon, saying the decision showed ""political animus.""
With Parler's future uncertain, we fact-checked Nunes' claim that Republicans have no way to communicate and found it to be a gross exaggeration. Nunes has lost one tool in his toolbox to communicate with constituents, but he and other Republicans still have many others, both on social media and other methods.
Lawmakers have lots of ways to communicate with constituents 
In the past, it was Nunes who was pushing social media companies to restrict speech that he objected to. He filed several defamation lawsuits against media companies and critics, including one against Twitter over a parody account purporting to represent a fictitious Nunes-owned dairy cow.
We contacted a spokesperson for Nunes to ask about his latest criticism of social media regulation, but did not get a response. 
Some users on Twitter found it ironic that Nunes was making his claim on Fox News, the most watched cable network, and a favorite medium for Republicans to communicate.
""This reminds me of that Lisa Kudrow character on that Netflix mockumentary where she repeats 'conservative voices are being silenced' on multiple TV shows, interviews, book titles etc.,"" replied one Twitter user.
And long before social media, members of Congress had several venues to communicate with constituents, including some unfiltered ones.
""There is a full time media press corps in the Capitol all day, every day -- members of Congress have almost open access if they want to get something out,"" Brendan Buck, a former staffer to Republican House Speakers Paul Ryan and John Boehner, told PolitiFact. ""Each one of them has their own website and are able to post whatever they want."" 
House members can communicate via press releases, send out mass emails or paper mail to constituents, or host phone-in or online town halls. Capitol Hill has places where members can hold in-person press conferences or satellite interviews with media outlets back home or national outlets, or record a video message to email to their constituents.

Republicans can give interviews to local media outlets, conservative radio or TV shows that welcome conservative points of view. 
""There is no shortage of places for a member of Congress to communicate through traditional media, and still more through direct channels to constituents,"" Buck said.
When members go home to their districts, they speak at gatherings such as chamber of commerce luncheons, civic and religious groups and community fairs (though some such events are done remotely now amid the pandemic).
Nunes' own congressional website includes links to his official Twitter and Facebook pages, accounts he still can use, although they have fewer than the 3 million followers he said he had on Parler. He also has a personal Twitter account that has 1.2 million followers.
Nunes' website also shows he has press releases, and people can subscribe to his emails. Nunes uses Rumble, a video streaming service that is seen as the conservative alternative to YouTube.
House members get an allowance of taxpayer funds to pay for staff and supplies, including communications. Separately, lawmakers' campaign operations receive donations that help fund their communications with voters.
Buck described social media as a tool that supplements the other ways members communicate with their constituents. But some former staffers said it became a crucial tool to communicate quickly and directly with constituents without having to involve reporters. 
""It is the best way, but it is not the only way,"" said Rusty Roberts, who was chief of staff for U.S. Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., from 1992 to 2011. ""It's immediate communication.""
Regulation by Twitter and Facebook
Nunes said that ""left-wingers"" at Twitter and Facebook and Instagram regulate users and decide what content is violent and who gets shadowbanned, a practice that limits someone's reach on the web.
Twitter and Facebook have policies that allow them to remove accounts or posts that violate their terms of service. For example, Twitter prohibits tweets that threaten or glorify violence and Facebook removes harmful misinformation about COVID-19, including about the vaccines, and says it doesn't allow threats.
While Trump lost his access to Twitter and Facebook under these rules, other Republicans, including Nunes, still have broad access to various communication channels. 
""As Rep. Nunes was on Fox when he said this, he seems to have ways to communicate,"" said Rebecca Jeschke, a spokesperson Electronic Frontier Foundation, a group which promotes free speech and digital privacy. ""Not to mention that these suspensions didn't hit anywhere near all the Republican politicians or voters in the country.""  
Our ruling
Nunes said ""Republicans have no way to communicate"" after recent actions by tech companies.
Trump has been blocked from the major social media networks, and Parler is not available for now. But Nunes is wrong to say Republicans have no way to communicate. 
They can use other social media platforms -- if they follow the rules -- as well as their websites, email and regular mail. Lawmakers can also grant interviews with local and national reporters from mainstream or conservative media outlets and hold constituent forums in their districts (albeit remotely for now).
For now, Nunes has lost what appears to be his preferred method of communication, but he has other options, and so do his Republican peers.
We rate this claim False.

Republicans have portrayed Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson as soft on criminals. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., suggested the federal judge ""consistently called for greater freedom for hardened criminals.""
During the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing March 21, Blackburn said to Jackson, ""At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, you advocated and again I quote for 'each and every criminal defendant in D.C. Corrections custody should be released.' That would have been 1,500 criminals back on the street if you had had your way."" 
Blackburn's statement creates an impression that Jackson advocated for releasing incarcerated defendants en masse, and that's wrong. The senator also cherry-picks part of Jackson's April 10, 2020, ruling in one case in which she actually denied an inmate's request for release.
We contacted Blackburn's office to ask for her evidence about President Joe Biden's Supreme Court nominee and did not get a response by our deadline.
Jackson's record on releasing defendants
The case at hand was a motion by a defendant, Sean Ray Wiggins, who sought to be released from the D.C. jail to home confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time of Jackson's ruling in April 2020, 41 inmates had tested positive for COVID-19 in the jail. Jackson was a U.S. District Court judge in Washington, D.C.
Prosecutors opposed Wiggins' request for release, arguing he was a danger to the community. Wiggins had pleaded guilty to participating in a large heroin trafficking conspiracy, and law enforcement found a significant amount of ammunition at his home when they arrested him.
Jackson did make the statement that Blackburn quotes about releasing defendants:
""The obvious increased risk of harm that the COVID-19 pandemic poses to individuals who have been detained in the District's correctional facilities reasonably suggests that each and every criminal defendant who is currently in D.C. DOC custody -- and who thus cannot take independent measures to control their own hygiene and distance themselves from others -- should be released,"" Jackson wrote. 
But Blackburn omits that Jackson also wrote that there are constraints on judicial authority and that statutes mandate an assessment of an inmate's flight risk and dangerousness and that releasing dangerous defendants ""poses substantial risks to probation officers, law enforcement, and the public at large."" She concluded that Wiggins had not met the conditions for release and denied his motions.
The Congressional Research Service wrote that many of Jackson's decisions about releasing defendants during the pandemic ""did not rely on it to grant release automatically"" and that her decisions reflect ""attention to case-specific circumstances."" 
The report cites multiple examples of when Jackson denied motions for release:

Shinzo Abe was assassinated because he ""didn't mandate vaccines, sent 1.6 million doses back and gave citizens ivermectin.""

Hartley James Lee, who was charged with possession of firearms. Jackson wrote that she agreed with recent precedents that ""rejected emergency motions for release of otherwise healthy and potentially violent defendants based solely on the generalized risks that COVID-19 admittedly creates for all members of our society."" Jackson cited a ruling by a magistrate judge who concluded that Lee was not likely to comply with release conditions and that he may act violently if released.


Robert Leake, a defendant charged with drug and gun offenses, which Jackson described as ""serious and dangerous."" Jackson said that while Leake had mild asthma, he had a history of noncompliance with conditions of release, so there wasn't a compelling reason for his release. 


  Jeremy Sears, pleaded guilty to distribution of child pornography. He sought release due to conditions including diabetes and asthma. Jackson wrote that Sears was at high risk of reoffending without treatment and had not had any sex offender treatment while in custody.


In at least two decisions in 2020, the Congressional Research Service found, Jackson granted release to federal offenders based in part on the pandemic after examining factors specific to each offender:


D'Angelo Dunlap, an inmate who had serious underlying medical conditions including a heart abnormality. Dunlap, a heroin addict, pleaded guilty to two counts of bank robbery. Jackson wrote that Dunlap ""did not have a weapon and did not specifically threaten violence"" and that he didn't pose a danger to anyone but himself. She ordered him released, with the first six months of his 36-month term of supervised release under home incarceration.


Morris Gemal Johnson, who was convicted of weapons-related offenses. Johnson was an honorably discharged veteran with no prior criminal history who completed two tours in Afghanistan and had since been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Johnson had generally complied with release conditions for the 3.5 years it took to bring his case to trial. 


In a case unrelated to the pandemic, Jackson granted release to a 72-year-old prisoner who had served 49 years in prison and had medical conditions. LaVance Greene in 1971 fatally shot a marshal as Greene assisted his half brother from escaping custody during a funeral furlough. Greene, 23 at the time, was found guilty of felony murder and armed robbery. Prison officers supported his request for release and said he was a model inmate. 
Our ruling 
Blackburn said that at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Jackson advocated that ""each and every criminal defendant in D.C. Corrections custody should be released."" 
Blackburn plucked out part of a statement by Jackson in an April 2020 ruling while omitting that the judge also wrote that statutes mandate assessment of an inmate's flight risk and the danger they pose. Jackson concluded that the inmate had not met the conditions for release and denied his motion. 
Blackburn's statement suggests that Jackson released all inmates who came before her en masse, and that's wrong.
Jackson denied some inmates' requests for release and granted other ones, taking into account factors such as the likelihood they would reoffend and whether they would comply with conditions of release. 
We rate this statement Mostly False.

Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.
On Jan. 20, 2021, Kamala Harris placed her hand on a Bible and took the oath of office, becoming the first woman in United States' history to be sworn in as vice president. Shortly after, a photograph from the inauguration started circulating along with the claim that Harris' hand wasn't actually on a Bible. Rather, the social media post claimed Harris was sworn in on a clutch purse:

This is a genuine photograph, but the object Harris is touching is not a purse, it's a Bible. 
Harris was sworn in on two Bibles. The Bible at the top of this picture belonged to the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. The Bible on the bottom belonged to close family friend Regina Shelton.  






NPR reported:
Harris used two Bibles in the ceremony. The first belonged to Regina Shelton, a family friend whom Harris viewed as a surrogate mother. Harris has used this Bible before, when she took the oath of office as both California attorney general and U.S. senator. The second Bible was previously owned by the late Justice Thurgood Marshall, the first Black member of the Supreme Court and Harris' lifelong political role model.
This rumor likely stems from (in addition to general misogyny toward the first female vice president and unfounded conspiracy theories that Democrats are Satanists) the fact that this Bible was in a zipped leather case. While Bible cases may be unfamiliar to those spreading this false rumor, they are not uncommon. Harris' cover even includes the words ""Holy Bible"" along its spine.
The photograph at top of this article provides another angle of Harris taking the oath of office where the words ""Holy Bible"" are clearly visible. Here's a closer look at the Bibles used during Harris' inauguration:

09.NoJoeBidenDidNotLowe,"
In early 2021, readers asked Snopes to look into social media posts claiming U.S. President Joe Biden had lowered the age of sexual consent to 8 years old.
The false and completely fabricated claim came in two principle forms. One was a screenshot of a fake NBC headline, which contained a photograph of Biden and the text ""BREAKING -- President Biden has officially lowered the age of consent to 8"":

It's not clear where the meme originated, but Facebook users began to share it widely in late January 2021, after Biden's inauguration. 
The second meme was a screenshot of a fake CNN article which included the headline ""Biden Administration Lowers Age of Consent to 8"" and the following text:
President Joe Biden's administration confirmed that the legal age of consent will be lowered to 8 starting February 16th. During a speech Tuesday afternoon, Biden stated ""We have to do it... The age, the kids, they should be about this old."" Biden then held up a gesture suggesting the historic decrease. This change is a huge win for progressives everywhere seeking to increase freedom for children. The incoming Defense Secretary detailed their plan to export this progress worldwide, freeing savage countries who let children become weary with old age before breeding is allowed. 







Those reports were, of course, egregious and distasteful nonsense. Biden never made the remarks attributed to him in the fake CNN article, and the screenshot copied and pasted the byline (including the rather specific ""Updated"" time and date) from a real CNN story published on Jan. 27, and shown below:

Neither Biden nor his administration, nor the Justice Department, nor any official in the Biden administration, announced an intention to change the age of sexual consent. Such reports made little sense anyway, since the age of consent is governed by criminal statutes on a state-by-state basis, rather than a federal level. (Federal law does prohibit interstate travel for the purpose of engaging in a sexual encounter with a person aged under 18, but that's not quite the same thing.) 
The memes appeared to form part of a broader set of conspiracy theories, aligned with QAnon and Pizzagate, which falsely claim a global liberal elite, including figures such as Biden, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and others, are engaged in child sexual abuse, ritual sacrifice, and Satan-worshipping on a massive scale. During the 2020 presidential election, then-President Donald Trump amplified such baseless conspiracy theories by promoting tweets that described Biden as a pedophile.

11.AaronSalterJrwaskilledbyamassshooterbecausehewasworkingoncreatingawaterpoweredcarengine,"
Aaron Salter Jr. was working as a security guard at Tops Friendly Markets in Buffalo, New York, on May 14 when an 18-year-old man opened fire on shoppers. Police say Salter, 55, fired at the gunman several times before he himself was slain -- one of 10 people shot to death by a white man who police say was motivated to kill Black people.
But a claim on Facebook is spinning a different tale about Salter, a retired police lieutenant who has been hailed as a hero, suggesting that he was actually killed because he was working on making a water-powered vehicle.
""Mr. Salter was just on the news about a month ago explaining an invention he made, which was an engine that runs completely off water, no fuel needed,"" said a man in a Facebook video posted May 30 and shared tens of thousands of times. ""A completely hydrogen-fuel(ed) system. And we all know what happened to the last person who decided to come forth with an invention similar to this one.""
That's an apparent reference to Stanley Meyer, an inventor of a water-powered fuel cell for car engines. Meyer, who died in 1998, has been at the center of a decades-old conspiracy theory that he was killed by the government for his invention. We've fact checked that claim to be False.
Like the claim about Meyer, this video about Salter was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
It's true that Salter was working to power vehicles with water. But there is no evidence that work made him a target in a mass shooting.
In a May 16 call to law enforcement, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray was clear about what investigators believe motivated these killings: ""From everything we know, this was a targeted attack, a hate crime and an act of racially motivated violent extremism.""
Payton Gendron, armed with three firearms and tactical gear, drove more than 200 miles from his hometown, Conklin, New York, to the Tops grocery store, according to police. He shot four people in the parking lot of the store, three of whom died, then went inside and shot eight more, police say. Video that Gendron live streamed from the scene captured glimpses of Salter's attempts to halt the rampage, according to reporting by the Buffalo News.
An 180-page screed that was posted online and attributed to Gendron detailed his belief in the ""great replacement theory,"" a racist conspiracy that claims immigrants and people of color will replace white people in the country in order to outvote them and replace them racially. The document described Black people as ""replacers.""

Says an image shows the Highland Park shooting suspect ""in jail or rehab or a psychiatric center"" before the shooting.












By Bill McCarthy * July 5, 2022







None of the victims in the mass shooting are named in the online document, and there is no evidence that Gendron knew who his victims were ahead of time. But 11 of the 13 killed or injured in the attack were Black, including Salter. 
Friends and family remembered Salter for his nearly 30 years on the Buffalo police force. 
""Even in his retirement, he literally made Tops his priority,"" Salter's son, Aaron Salter III, told the Democrat & Chronicle newspaper. ""He made sure he was there and he was making sure that the store was safe at all times.""
Salter was also working to complete his bachelor's degree at Canisius College and, according to his LinkedIn profile, ran a business called AWS Hydrogen Technologies, LLC. While the Facebook video described Salter as being on the ""news"" for his car technology, it appears to have drawn clips from two 2015 YouTube videos in which Salter spoke about his work applying  water electrolysis, the process of using electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, to fuel vehicles.
""I'm always working on my vehicles and or my project of running engines on water for the last four years or so,"" Salter wrote on his LinkedIn profile. ""I would like to realize my dream of getting cars to run off of water using my newly discovered energy source some day.""
In one of the YouTube videos, Salter showed the hydrogen electrolysis generator he had built in the back of his truck and gave a step-by-step presentation of how the generator worked, along with the truck's original gas engine, to power the vehicle. Salter also tested how long the vehicle could run on hydrogen by using only the generator. In another video, he told a colleague that his interest in alternative energy sources started with solar power.
Our ruling
A viral conspiracy shared across social media, including in a Facebook post, claims that Aaron Salter Jr. was killed in the Buffalo mass shooting due to his work creating a water-powered engine for vehicles.
Salter was indeed working on water-powered vehicle technology. But there is no evidence backing the claim that he was targeted because of it. Salter, along with nine other victims, was shot and killed by a gunman who police say targeted them because they were Black. Three other people were injured in the attack. 
We rate the social media claim False.

Deaths from COVID-19 continue to rise across the globe. New York City continues to be in the mist of an unprecedented public health crisis. The prime minister of the United Kingdom, diagnosed weeks ago with COVID-19, was recently released from intensive-care hospitalization. Despite these incontrovertible realities, some individuals online remain invested in convincing you the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is an overblown media invention. One such person is Eric Nepute, a chiropractor described on YouTube as a ""real doctor telling it like it is.""
A 20-minute screed live-streamed by Nepute is memorialized on that platform (confusingly attributed to ""Frank Hahnel"" in many cases). The video, at least one version of which had been viewed 1.3 million times, makes several unsupported, contradictory, or dangerously misinformed arguments about a) the media's misrepresenting the severity of the pandemic; and b) the efficacy of Schweppes tonic water in preventing or treating COVID-19. Here we analyze the claims, misrepresentations, and pseudoscientific assertions that make this video potently dangerous in the time of a global pandemic.
Who is Eric Nepute?
Despite being described as a ""real doctor"" on YouTube, Nepute is not an MD or DO -- the two degrees that allow one to be recognized as a medical doctor in the U.S. He holds a Doctorate of Chiropractic degree from Logan University and is accredited by the state of Missouri where he runs his own clinic. It is unclear how this training makes him an expert in epidemiology, virology, or the science of pandemics. ""I'm a physician,"" he stated at one point in the video.
Should I 'Go Get Some Schweppes Tonic Water'?
Nepute spends a perplexing amount of time in the livestream advocating Schweppes tonic water for the prevention of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease. These claims are problematic for several reasons, but perhaps the most obvious is Nepute's interchangeable use of quinine, the chemical, with Schweppes tonic water, the mixer.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) limits quinine content in tonic water to no more than 83 parts per million. Put another way, this is approximately 83 milligrams of quinine per one liter of tonic water. For comparison, the amount of quinine approved as a treatment for simple cases of malaria is ""648 mg every 8 hours for 7 days."" To get a sense of how little quinine is in tonic water compared to the amount required for medical use, think of it this way: You would need to drink more than 12 liters of Schweppes tonic water every eight hours to maintain those therapeutic levels of quinine (usually provided in pill form) from tonic water. Despite this reality, Nepute frequently conflates the two:
Tonic water has a ton of quinine in it. ... If you know someone who's got flu like symptoms, if they've got symptoms of COVID-19, the cold, the flu, whatever, go and get some ... quinine and/or Schweppes Tonic Water 






Regardless of any alleged efficacy against COVID-19, in other words, the amount of quinine in tonic water is medically negligible.
Are Quinine, Chloroquine, and Hydroxychloroquine Interchangeable Treatments?
To bolster his argument in support of tonic water, Nepute falsely equates quinine (all 83 milligrams per liter of it) with the drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine -- two antimalarials promoted aggressively by U.S. President Donald Trump and others. In support of that argument, Nepute cited a local news article about a Los Angeles doctor who claims he has been treating patients at his private practice with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and zinc successfully.
""When people get on this protocol, typically within 12 to 24 hours, they're literally walking out of the hospitals,"" he stated in the video. This claim, based on the testimony of a doctor/CEO who benefits financially from people visiting his clinic and provided without any data about the condition of the patients treated, is at best anecdotal and more likely than not scientifically useless. 
At several points, Nepute broadly implied that chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and quinine work in ""similar-ish"" ways and are therefore interchangeable. The ""similar-ish"" mechanism shared by these three chemicals, according to Nepute, is their alleged ability to make ""the cell wall more permeable so that it helps get toxins out of the cell and helps get nutrients in."" Suggestions of the interchangeability of these three chemicals are misleading and falsely imply the same level of risk associated with each treatment.
Quinine is a naturally occurring chemical derived from quinoline, an alkaloid found in the bark of cinchona trees. Two synthetically produced drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, are based structurally on quinoline as well -- they belong to a group of chemicals called 4-aminoquinolines. As antimalarials, these drugs have a similar mechanism of action: Their structure allows them to block the ability of the malaria-causing parasite to digest the chemical hemoglobin found in blood without poisoning itself. 
As antiviral treatments, however, things are far less clear cut. Researchers have long observed that some quinoline drugs appear to act against some kinds of viruses, including coronaviruses, but the mechanism for these actions is poorly understood, and almost all of the research in support of the notion comes from cell culture studies that may have limited relevance in demonstrating efficacy in humans. Most research suggests that these chemicals' antiviral properties stem from an ability to alter intracellular pH levels in a way that blocks viruses from replicating. The proposed ""toxin"" mechanism in no way describes the reason for the potential antiviral properties of quinoline drugs.
Zinc, too, could play a role in limiting viral replication, but the evidence here is conflicting as well. Research suggests that zinc may be able to inhibit the spread of some viral infections, but the question remains unsettled. A 2010 study using cell cultures published in PLOS One found evidence that increasing intracellular zinc concentrations ""can efficiently impair the replication of a variety of RNA viruses"" including coronaviruses. According to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, ""trials conducted in high-income countries since 1984 investigating the role of zinc for the common cold symptoms have had mixed results."" The idea behind mixing zinc with quinoline-style treatments stems, as suggested by Nepute, from laboratory studies that suggest the former aids in the cellular absorption of the latter. It remains unclear if this mechanism would have a clinical relevance in the human body, however. 






In sum, quinine, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine may or may not have some kind of action against COVID-19 due to vaguely understood antiviral properties, but the ""mechanisms"" described by Nepute are either flat out wrong or overstate the scientific certainty behind their use. From a big-picture perspective, unless you are planning on drinking around 25 liters of Schweppes tonic water a day, any claim that equates tonic water with any of these three treatments is meaningless.
Will 'Getting Healthy' Prevent COVID-19?
Nepute asserts that an adequate defense against COVID-19 is healthy living, adding that ""we're going to get through this in the next couple of weeks"" -- an assertion that bears scant semblance to any scientific reality:
You know what? Here's the truth. The truth is this. Get healthy and now's the time to do it. Most of you guys are on lockdown for the next two weeks to four weeks. It's time instead of getting fat, let's get fit. Let's eat right. Let's exercise, let's move. Let's take our supplements. Let's get some C, some zinc, some vitamin D. Let's get some elderberries, some astragalus. Let's get some quinine. Let's get a good probiotic and let's eat good, clean, healthy foods. Not the crap in the middle of the aisles, this process, but go get some vegetables, eat a little bit of fruit, eat some clean meat, some grass fed beef.
Not only does such a line of thinking downplay the severity of the disease, it falsely suggests that people with healthy immune function have nothing to worry about with regard to it.  This is simply not true -- a significant subgroup of COVID-19 deaths or complications occur in young, healthy people with no known risk factors, as reported in Vox:

""A lot of young patients without comorbidities are getting very sick, and we wish we knew who was going to deteriorate,"" Dr. Rochelle Walensky, chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor of medicine at Harvard, told reporters last week. ""We do know it happens precipitously. One day they're okay, the next day they require intubation. [It's] one of scariest parts of this disease.""

Is the Media 'Lying' to You?
Nepute's video jumps between the problematic medical advice discussed above and anti-media conspiracy theories -- oftentimes mid-sentence. In his video Nepute asserted that, ""You guys are being lied to, propagated to us by the false news fake narratives that are out there. People are trying to get us all riled up and in a panic."" To make this argument, Nepute claimed that the media and/or the government overcounts COVID-19 deaths. To do this, Nepute cherry-picked two news reports that, he seems to believe, prove the media's duplicity. 






The first report concerned the death of an extremely preterm baby in Louisiana born after the infant's mother, severely ill with COVID-19, was placed on a respirator. Speaking to NBC News, William Clark, a coroner for the East Baton Rouge Parish in which this event occurred, explained why this death is counted as a COVID-19 death despite the baby testing negative for the disease:
""We all agree that this would be considered a COVID-19 related death because of the positive nature of the mother in this scenario,"" he said. ""Had she not been COVID-19 positive, had not required ventilatory support, had not had shortness of breath and the hypoxia that's associated with the virus, likely she would have not gone into preterm labor and there would have been a different outcome.""
This explanation evidently incensed Nepute, who used this single incident as evidence that COVID-19 death counts, in general, are incorrect. The second story cherry-picked by Nepute stems from the death of a 7-month-old Connecticut baby described by Gov. Ned Lamont as ""probably the youngest person to ever die of COVID."" Though the baby had tested positive for COVID-19, the official cause of death has not yet been determined, leading Nepute to accuse Lamont and the media of scaremongering or narrative-pushing.
In reality, the uncertain nature of this death and its reporting in the press stem from two different standards of evidence. ""The Department of Public Health tally of COVID-19 deaths includes all people who test positive for the virus just before or after their death,"" Connecticut State Epidemiologist Matthew Cartter explained on April 10. ""That's different from saying COVID-19 caused someone's death."" An autopsy is currently being performed to determine the cause of death.
Regardless, armchair speculation about fraudulent COVID-19 deaths counts miss, catastrophically, the bigger picture of the pandemic. That picture is one of unprecedented mortality -- regardless of classification -- in so-called COVID-19 hot spots like New York City. On April 10, The New York Times presented monthly data on all deaths in New York City, finding there to be twice as many overall in March 2020 compared to previous years, for example:

Should You Go to Hospitals To Find Out 'What Is Really Going On'?
In one of the most aggressively flawed bits of advice proffered in the video, Nepute implored his viewers to go ""to hospitals right now,"" suggesting a need to expose the actual truth behind the pandemic. ""I mean independent people should be going and ask to volunteer at hospitals and see how crazy it is,"" Nepute told his viewers. ""Journalists should be going inside of the emergency rooms in the ICU to find out what the hell is really going on in there.""
Do not do this. Such a move would expose you to potentially contagious individuals, directly expose front-line healthcare workers to more risk than they already have, and place an undue burden on a medical system already unprepared for this pandemic. Several qualified individuals, it also bears mentioning, have already done valuable work documenting the pandemic.
Jeff Rhode, a staff photographer at a hospital in Teaneck, New Jersey, has been documenting the response to COVID-19 there almost daily since the pandemic began. His reporting is vivid and can be viewed without endangering anyone's health here. You can also view videos leaked to the media from ER doctors fighting COVID-19, such as this one published by The New York Times. The account of a Chicago doctor who volunteered  to be the person in charge of the dangerous job of placing respirators into patients with severe and often fatal COVID-19 cases also provides harrowing details into what ""is really going on"" inside these hospitals.
The Bottom Line
Nepute's video is a case study in the abuse of anecdotal information. From a single news report about a handful of cases at one clinic in Los Angeles, Nepute concluded that chloroquine and zinc ""crushes"" COVID-19. From two news reports about young children's deaths being classified, with some controversy, as COVID-19 related, Nepute has concluded that the news media is trying to cause a COVID-19 panic with the ultimate goal of pushing a new vaccine on the American populace.
On top of the limited evidence to support his wild claims, Nepute went further by making a series of scientifically impossible claims about the relationship between antimalarials and Schweppes tonic water. Nepute used (anecdotal) evidence about chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as if it were evidence for the efficacy of tonic water. This is dangerous on its own, given the fact that quinine and those two drugs each come with different risks, but it is also self-evidently absurd given the dearth of quinine in tonic water.
For valid information and hard data from actual medical doctors with expertise in virology, immunology, or pandemic responses, we recommend the COVID-19 information portals at the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or Johns Hopkins University.

President Donald Trump repeated a viral claim from conservative media that President Barack Obama granted U.S. citizenship to 2,500 Iranians, including family members of government officials, as part of the Iran nuclear agreement reached in 2015.
""Iranian Official Drops Bombshell: Obama secretly gave citizenship to 2,500 Iranians as part of nuke deal,"" said a July 2 headline on Diamond and Silk, who are pro-Trump activists.
Facebook users flagged this story as part of efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The story was largely lifted from Fox News and repeated by Trump and other websites.

How big (and bad) is that?"" tweeted Trump, who announced in May that the United States was pulling out of the agreement to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions.
We found that the claim lacks evidence. Our fact-checking friends at Factnameh, a Canada-based website that fact-checks claims about Iran, found that the statement by the Iranian official has no evidence to back it up.

Fox News attributed report to one Iranian official
Fox News attributed its report to Hojjat al-Islam Mojtaba Zolnour, chairman of Iran's parliamentary nuclear committee and a member of its national security and foreign affairs committee.
Zolnour made the allegations during an interview with the country's Etemad newspaper, cited by the country's Fars News agency, a ""semi-official"" organ of the Iranian government.
Zolnour claimed that the citizenships were granted as a favor to senior Iranian officials linked to President Hassan Rouhani, Fox said.
""When Obama, during the negotiations about the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly referred to as the Iran deal), decided to do a favor to these men, he granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians and some officials started a competition over whose children could be part of these 2,500 Iranians,"" he claimed.
Fox News analyst and former Obama State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told Fox News, ""This sounds like totally made up B.S.""
Other officials in the Obama administration also said the statement was false.
Richard Nephew, who works for Columbia University and was the State Department's lead sanctions expert from August 2013 to December 2014, told PolitiFact that the claim ""is entirely nonsense.""

""It would have made no sense for us to have done this and less sense for the officials to have agreed/requested citizenship,"" he said. ""While I was on the team, this wasn't even discussed, considered or thought about. I would bet any sum you'd care to wager that this didn't come up after I left the talks. And, it is worth noting that after years of congressional inquiry into this, we never heard of it. I find it hard to believe that's because this one opposition politician in Iran was the only person who knew about it.""
Suzanne Maloney, deputy director of the Foreign Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, who served on State's Policy Planning Staff from 2005-07, also expressed disbelief. (She held a part-time outside advisor role during the early part of Obama's administration.)
Maloney said the issue of U.S. citizenship or green cards has long been a contentious one within the Iranian establishment. There are a few Iranians within the ruling establishment who have or had U.S. citizenship or permanent residency, typically dating from the pre-revolutionary period.
There are also Iranian officials whose children have attended U.S. universities and stayed in the United States, or married dual nationals and obtained residency or citizenship.
""Given the longstanding estrangement between the U.S. and Iran, the allegation alone is used as a smear, to impugn the patriotism and question the motives of rival officials by essentially accusing them of hypocrisy and ideological opportunism,"" she said.
Zolnour is a hard-line cleric, she said.
""So it's not surprising that a politician who is critical of the nuclear deal would use this line of attack, especially in the aftermath of President Trump's dismantling of the deal, which has generated an intense backlash toward the proponents of the agreement,"" Maloney said. ""And yes, Iranians of all political stripes are prone to indulging fairly creative conspiracy theories, especially hardliners and especially conspiracy theories about the U.S.""
Ali Vaez, the anti-war Crisis Group's Iran Project Director, told PoltiiFact that Zolnour is a firebrand who is well known for his false claims.
Vaez said that Zolnour is using this claim to undermine President Hassan Rouhani and his allies as the parliament is trying to pass a bill to ban dual-nationals from serving in the Iranian government.
We emailed the Diamond and Silk website and did not get a reply. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment to Fox News, and we didn't get a reply to our email. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert was asked about Trump's tweet at the July 3 press briefing and referred reporters to homeland security.
Our ruling
A headline on a Diamond and Silk website said ""Obama secretly gave citizenship to 2,500 Iranians as part of nuke deal.""
The article stemmed from a Fox News report which was based on comments by Hojjat al-Islam Mojtaba Zolnour, an Iranian official, who made the allegation during an interview with the country's Etemad newspaper, cited by the country's semi-official Fars News agency. The report doesn't appear to include any actual evidence.
Fox News' report contained no confirmation by U.S. government officials working in the Trump administration. Former Obama administration officials denied the report and experts expressed skepticism.
We rate claims based on available evidence, and so far have found none to support the claim.

President Donald Trump has deployed an array of claims to undercut the substance, process and key figures of the Democratic-driven impeachment investigation.
Many were wrong. PolitiFact named one our 2019 Lie of the Year. Here are 10 other significant ones we heard and fact-checked in 2019.
RELATED: Trump's claim that whistleblower got his Ukraine call 'almost completely wrong' is the 2019 Lie of the Year
1. ""What is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP.""
Pants on Fire. There are lots of different kinds of coups, and what's underway in Washington doesn't match any of them. A coup is the sudden removal of a leader, outside of any regular or legal process. The constitutional convention of 1787 established impeachment as one of the guardrails of American governance.
2. ""They gave the server to Crowdstrike or whatever it's called, which is a company owned by a very wealthy Ukrainian. And I still want to see that server, you know the FBI has never gotten that server, that's a big part of this whole thing. Why did they give it to a Ukrainian company?""
Hollow conspiracy theory. Crowdstrike is a California cybersecurity company that is owned by Americans, not anyone in Ukraine. The DNC hired the firm in 2016 after Russian agents hacked its servers. The notion that any servers -- the DNC's or Hillary Clinton's -- wound up in Ukraine is a myth, ginned up on internet sites like Reddit and 4chan.
3. ""Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, and the rest of the corrupt Democrats made a promise to their crazy left-wing base that they would impeach me even BEFORE I took office."" 
False. Pelosi and Schiff were very late to impeachment, pushing back against calls that came from more fiery members of their party. In the irony department: The day Trump had his call with Zelensky, July 25, Schiff told CNN that the country shouldn't be put through impeachment.
4. Says Joe Biden ""said he never spoke to the Ukrainian company, and then the picture came out where he was playing golf with the company boss and Hunter"" Biden.
False. There's a picture of Biden and three others on a Long Island golf course. None of them owned or ran the Ukrainian gas company that hired Biden's son.
5. ""Longstanding whistleblower rules (were changed) just before submittal of the fake whistleblower report.""  
False. The same rules have been in place since 2014, when they were first written to protect intelligence worker whistleblowers. There was a recent change in the forms whistleblowers submit, but that had no effect on what was required for a whistleblower report to move forward.
6. ""Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its prosecutor .... the prosecutor said he was forced out for leading a corruption probe into Hunter Biden's company. ... Democrats want to impeach President Trump for discussing this investigation with Ukraine's President.""  
False. This Trump campaign ad would have people believe that there was an active investigation in 2015 of the Ukrainian energy company that hired Biden's son Hunter. But the investigation had been sidelined -- by the prosecutor Biden said should be replaced.
7. ""They never thought ... that I was going to release that call and I really had no choice because Adam Schiff made up a call."" 
False. Trump has things backward. First he released the memo that described his July 25 call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. Schiff then delivered a dramatized ""essence"" of the call the next day. 
8. ""Europe and other nations (need to) contribute to Ukraine. Because they're not doing it. Just the United States. We're putting up the bulk of the money."" 
Mostly False. The European Union and member nations gave much more to Ukraine than the United States. Depending on how you count, it was $12 billion to $15 billion, compared to $1.5 billion from the United States. The American aid was largely military, however, while Europe's was aimed at economic development and boosting government capacity in Ukraine.
9. Says William Taylor and George Kent, two public witnesses in the House impeachment inquiry, are ""Never Trumpers.""
False. Both Taylor and Kent are career officials, who served under Republican and Democratic presidents, and were appointed to their current jobs on Trump's watch. Neither signed letters opposing Trump, and those who did sign say Taylor and Kent never associated with the group.
10. ""A lot of people are talking about"" the removal of a ""very fair prosecutor"" in Ukraine.
False. The Ukrainian prosecutor Trump referred to was well known for playing a familiar game in Ukraine of pursuing or dropping investigations as a form of political punishment or reward. That's why the International Monetary Fund, the European Union and the U.S. State Department wanted him gone.

70.Factcheckingnewcomer,"
Just days into her new job as a congresswoman from Colorado, Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert has drawn attention for her tweets, her resistance to some security protocols at the Capitol, and her intent to carry her firearm into the Capitol building.
Democratic lawmakers have also chastised Boebert for tweeting about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's movements during the Jan. 6 Capitol riots.
Before her election, Boebert gained national attention for appearing to be open to the QAnon conspiracy theory. In a May interview, Boebert said that ""everything that I've heard of Q, I hope that this is real, because it only means America is getting stronger and better and people are returning to conservative values, and that's what I am for.""
But later, in October, she told a Colorado TV news station: ""I'm not a follower of QAnon.""
PolitiFact reviewed some of her latest claims made on the House floor, on Twitter and in a Jan. 11 statement.
Claim: ""The hypocrisy of the left is on full display ... 'Take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.' ... Sound familiar?""
Boebert's claim goes back to remarks Joe Biden made in reaction to Trump's lewd comments about women, caught in an ""Access Hollywood"" video before Trump became president. The 2005 video surfaced weeks before 2016's Election Day.
""The press always asks me, don't I wish I were debating him?"" Biden said in October 2016. ""No, I wish we were in high school, I could take him behind the gym. That's what I wish.""
Biden made similar remarks during a March 2018 event at the University of Miami: ""They asked me if I'd like to debate this gentleman, and I said, 'No.' I said, 'If we were in high school, I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him'.""
In a podcast interview later that month, Biden said he ""shouldn't have said what I said.""
Claim: ""What about the gentlewoman from New York who defended the looting by saying looters just wanted loaves of bread.""
Boebert misrepresented what Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-.N.Y., said about an uptick in New York crime.
In July 2020, Ocasio-Cortez offered several reasons why crime could be increasing in New York during a virtual town hall, among them: ""Maybe this has to do with the fact that people aren't paying their rent and are scared to pay their rent and so they go out and they need to feed their child and they don't have money. ... They are put in a position where they feel like they either need to shoplift some bread or go hungry.""
Claim: ""I am legally permitted to carry my firearm in Washington, D.C. and within the Capitol complex.""
This needs context. In another tweet, Boebert said she had a concealed carry permit issued by the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police. The law in D.C. says that a person needs to be licensed to carry a concealed firearm; open carry is prohibited.
In the Capitol complex, members of Congress are allowed to keep firearms in their offices and to transport them within Capitol grounds ""unloaded and securely wrapped,"" according to regulations from the Capitol Police Board. Lawmakers are prohibited from taking firearms inside the House and Senate chambers.
Federal law prohibits the general public from carrying firearms on Capitol grounds.
Claim: Democrats ""accuse me of live-tweeting the Speaker's presence after she had been safely removed from the Capitol, as if I was revealing some big secret, when in fact this removal was also being broadcast on TV.""
Some Democratic lawmakers have criticized Boebert for tweeting about Pelosi during the riots at the Capitol. That day, Boebert tweeted at 2:17 p.m. that members were locked in the House chamber. She tweeted an update a minute later: ""The Speaker has been removed from the chambers.""
Boebert's office said this was also obvious based on the video airing on C-SPAN. Around 2:14 p.m. Pelosi recognized Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., for his chance to speak on the House floor. About two minutes into his speech objecting to Arizona's Electoral College votes, Gosar looked straight up and began to say ""Madam Speaker"" -- but then corrected himself to say ""Mr. Speaker"" -- and asked for order in the room. The C-SPAN video showed that Pelosi was no longer at the speaker's chair.
Boebert's press office told PolitiFact that Pelosi and Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., changed seats in the middle of Gosar's speech and that chaos ensued.
""The C-SPAN video also shows shouting and other high-level members of Congress being escorted out of the chamber. People can be heard yelling to lock the doors before the House goes into recess and the cameras are shut off. Anyone watching C-SPAN at the time realized that the Speaker was in the Chair when Rep. Gosar started his speech and that the Speaker was no longer in the chair at the end of his speech and had been removed from the chamber,"" Boebert's press office said.
Boebert's office offered a statement from the congresswoman that said she ""never disclosed secure locations.""
Claim: ""The reality is that Joe Biden didn't condemn antifa when he had a chance to.""
We rated False a similar claim fromTrump. We've found that Biden has condemned antifa, a term used for a collection of far-left, anti-fascist groups that rally against white supremacy and other causes, at times resorting to violence.
A reporter for WGAL, an NBC affiliate in Pennsylvania, asked Biden early September whether he condemned antifa. ""Yes, I do, violence no matter who it is,"" Biden said. Biden on several occasions also has denounced violence, arson and looting tied to protests against excessive use of force by police.
Boebert's office sent links to a Wall Street Journal opinion piece and an article on the National Review, which said that during a late September debate with Trump, Biden described antifa as ""an idea, not an organization."" Biden during the debate said he was citing FBI Director Chris Wray's characterization of antifa. The debate moderator, Fox News' Chris Wallace, during the debate did not directly ask Biden to condemn antifa. Biden didn't offer a direct condemnation either, though he said ""violence in response is never appropriate, never appropriate. Peaceful protest is, violence is never appropriate.""
Claim: ""Kamala Harris spent much of the summer helping those arrested for violent behavior post bail and get back on the streets as quickly as possible.""
This is misleading. Harris in June asked people on Twitter to chip in to the Minnesota Freedom Fund ""to help post bail for those protesting on the ground in Minnesota."" The nonprofit pays bail for low-income people. As we reported in June, not all who were arrested during demonstrations following the death of George Floyd were rioting or engaged in violent behavior. People arrested included curfew violators, working press and others.
Harris in the summer of 2020 said she supported peaceful protesters, and urged to ""not confuse them with those looting and committing acts of violence.""
Claim: Pelosi ""encouraged uprisings all over the country.""
This needs context.
In June 2018, Pelosi spoke out against the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border. She told reporters that an association of evangelicals said in testimony to Congress that the U.S. refugee resettlement system was the ""crown jewel of American humanitarianism.""
""And in order to do away with that crown jewel, they're doing away with children being with their moms,"" Pelosi said. ""I just don't even know why there aren't uprisings all over the country. And maybe there will be, when people realize that this is a policy that they defend.""
The context of Pelosi's quote shows that she used the word ""uprising"" but did not instruct that violence be part of it.
Boebert's office also linked PolitiFact to a June 2020 letter that Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., sent Trump asking him to reopen Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C., the area where federal officers cleared protesters using chemical irritants. The letter said that the square had long been a place where Americans freely express their constitutional rights and urged Trump to ""tear down these walls, reopen Lafayette Square, and allow the public to gather there for you and all the world to hear their voices.""
The point of the letter was to get Trump to open up the square so people could gather; it did not green light violence.
Claim: Democrats ""objected in 2001, 2005 and 2017"" to Electoral College certification.
Boebert is right that some House Democrats objected to Electoral College certifications in 2001, 2005, and 2017. But those attempts were notably different from the one Republicans charged in 2021. The Democratic presidential nominees in those cases -- Al Gore, John Kerry, and Hillary Clinton -- had already conceded their loss.
Trump, on the other hand, refused to concede and encouraged the objections.
In 2017, several House Democrats cited voter suppression and objected to the certification of Trump's Electoral College victory in several states. But without a single senator supporting their challenge, the objections were not debated and went nowhere.
In 2005, two Democrats -- Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones of Ohio and Sen. Barbara Boxer of California -- objected to Ohio's electoral votes for George W. Bush, saying there had been voting irregularities. Both chambers held debates and rejected the objection.
In 2001, after the contest between Bush and Gore, several House Democrats objected to the certification of Florida's Electoral College votes, arguing that Black voters had been disenfranchised in the election. No senator supported their objection.

50.DidDHSSecretlyWaterm,"
Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.
In the uncertain days following the 2020 U.S. presidential election, a fantasy pushed by QAnon personalities and die-hard supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump went viral. In broad brushstrokes, the idea was that Democrats would soon be exposed in a massive voter-fraud sting operation orchestrated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The basic premise is that Democrats, in an effort to steal the election in favor of their party's nominee, Joe Biden, printed extra ballots. But, the claim goes, Trump's DHS anticipated this and added a secret watermark to the ballots, making it easy to identify the fraudulent ballots.
""The DEMS fell right into the trap of this sting operation and President Trump has it all,"" a viral bit of Facebook copypasta asserted. ""Fraud will be exposed for the world to see.""
As with most conspiracy theories, there are myriad variations on this broad claim, each with its own purported evidence. These variations, both tedious and irrelevant, generally concern the type of watermark used, and the presence or absence of some sort of blockchain-based security. Going into each of these different claims is unnecessary, as all versions of the claim hold that the ruse was possible because the federal government controls the production of ballots. This is, emphatically, not the case.
In fact, this is left up to the states, each of which has its own regulations to follow. Practically speaking, most elections are administered at the county level, where they are run either by a board of electors, an election official or officials, or both. This means there are, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than more than 10,000 unique election administration jurisdictions in the U.S., each of which with their own balloting procedures. The large conspiracy alleged here would necessarily involve infiltrating thousands of different election boards or jurisdictions.
The federal government is not responsible for printing or auditing the ballots, either. In most cases, private companies contracted by those local election boards to do the printing. DHS has explicitly stated this in response to these rumors:
While DHS and CISA assist states and localities with securing election infrastructure, DHS and CISA [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency] do not design, print, or audit ballots. State and local election officials manage ballot design and printing, as well as the auditing of results.
Local election offices have security and detection measures in place that make it highly difficult to commit fraud through counterfeit ballots. While the specific measures vary, in accordance with state and local election laws and practices, ballot security measures can include signature matching, information checks, barcodes, watermarks, and precise paper weights.
As such, DHS does not control ""official ballot production,"" nor does any central federal authority have that power. Therefore the central premise behind this QAnon fantasy and its claim of secretly watermarked ballots suffers from a profound ignorance of how American presidential elections actually work. For these reasons, the claim is false.

31.OnlineRantsbyWouldBe,"
BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Their anger is all over social media for the whole world to see, with rants about minorities, relationships gone bad or paranoid delusions about perceived slights.
The perpetrators of mass shootings often provide a treasure trove of insight into their violent tendencies, but the information is not always seen by law enforcement until after the violence is carried out. In addition, rants and hate speech rarely factor into whether someone passes a background check to buy guns.
The massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue, the pipe bombing attempts from last week and the Florida high school shooting this year have underscored the dilemma of law enforcement around the country in assessing the risk of people making online rants at a time when social media has become so ubiquitous.
""We can go out on Twitter and there are loads of people saying insane stuff, but how do you know which is the one person? It's always easy after the fact, to go: 'That was clear.' But clearly everyone spouting their mouth doesn't go and shoot up a synagogue,"" said David Chipman, a retired agent of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and now senior policy adviser for the Giffords Center.
Robert Bowers, the man accused of opening fire at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, expressed virulently anti-Semitic views on a social media site called Gab, according to an Associated Press review of an archived version of the posts made under his name. The cover photo for his account featured a neo-Nazi symbol, and his recent posts included a photo of a fiery oven like those used in Nazi concentration camps during World War II. Other posts referenced false conspiracy theories suggesting the Holocaust was a hoax. 






It was only just before the shooting that the poster believed to be Bowers seemed to cross the line, posting: ""I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in."" Authorities say Bower killed 11 people and injured six others, including four officers who responded.
Keeping tabs on social media posts has been used for years by law enforcement to try to identify potential threats. The task is enormous and it's an inexact science. The volume of posts is significant and the question arises: Is something a true threat or free speech?
They are mindful of the fact that the First Amendment protects Americans' right to express even speech that many in society find abhorrent -- and have to make often-subjective decisions about what crosses the line.
Among more than 550 police departments across the country surveyed several years ago by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, about three-quarters said they regularly searched social media for potential threats.
Lt. Chris Cook, spokesman for the Arlington, Texas, Police Department, said the searches are often done manually, using keywords to try to identify troubling posts.
""It's very time consuming, it's very staff and resource intensive and you have humans involved in the process so there is the potential that law enforcement can miss something,"" Cook said, adding that departments can't rely on social media alone. The community needs to be involved to report any suspicious behavior.
""Everyone has to be our extra eyes and ears out there,"" he said.
In one case where vigilance paid off, authorities say a black woman received troubling racist, harassing messages on Facebook from a man she didn't know, prompting her to call police. The tip from the New Jersey woman led Kentucky police to a home where they found Dylan Jarrell with a firearm, more than 200 rounds of ammunition, a bulletproof vest, a 100-round high-capacity magazine and a ""detailed plan of attack."" He was arrested just as he was leaving his driveway. 






Bowers is not alone among alleged mass shooters in making racist or bigoted comments online.
Dylann Roof, convicted of the 2015 slaying of nine black churchgoers in South Carolina, had posted a 2,000-word racist rant and posed in photos with firearms and the Confederate flag. Nikolas Cruz, the teenager charged in the slaying of 17 students and adults at a high school in Parkland, Florida, hurled online slurs against blacks and Muslims, and went so far as to state he wanted to be a ""professional school shooter.""
The rants did not affect their ability to buy guns. When purchasing a firearm, criminal background checks only look for any records showing a criminal past or mental health problems that led to an involuntary commitment.
""I always felt as an ATF agent, the way our laws were structured, ATF stood for 'After the Fact',"" Chipman said.
There have been some changes, however, to make it easier to alert authorities to warning signs. ""Red flag"" laws have been enacted in 13 states in the past couple of years, allowing relatives or law enforcement with concerns about a person's mental health to go to court and seek to have firearms removed at least temporarily.
But Erich Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, cautioned against using social media content to deny someone the constitutional right to own a firearm.
""I abhor hateful comments by the left or the right but I don't think you lose your rights for simply uttering,"" Pratt said.
He likened it to the Tom Cruise movie ""Minority Report,"" about law enforcement in the future using psychic technology to nab murderers before they commit a crime.
""It's dangerous to go down this road of Minority Report with pre-crime,"" he said. ""Nobody should lose their rights without due process.""

86.MarjorieTaylorGreene,"
This article is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.

When Georgia representative and sometime QAnon enthusiast Marjorie Taylor Greene met with fellow House Republicans on Feb. 3, she may have apologized. Or she may not have.
During the closed-door meeting in which Greene's conspiracy theory beliefs came up, we don't know exactly what went down because, well, it was behind closed doors.  






Speaking after the event, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy described Greene's remarks as an apology, saying that Greene had denounced her previous statements and social media postings - which included the idea that mass school shootings are ""false flag"" operations and that California forest fires were started by Jewish space lasers - and that ""she said she was wrong."" 
U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, one of 10 Republicans who voted in support of the 2021 impeachment of Donald Trump, had a different take: ""She was somewhat contrite, but personally I never heard an apology."" He added: ""I didn't hear an 'I'm going to say this publicly.'""
As a scholar who has written about the art of the public political apology, I found the whole episode fits into a larger pattern of nonapology apologies in the modern political landscape. 
Sorry seems to be the hardest word
An apology, according to the Canadian sociologist Erving Goffman, is ""a splitting of the self into a blameworthy part and a part that stands back and sympathizes with the blame giving."" Goffman goes on to say that after an offense has occurred, the job of the person apologizing is to show an understanding of the norm violated and the harm done.
What this means in practice is that offenders must identify what they did wrong and then demonstrate that they take responsibility for that wrong, that they accept the blame. To be a true apology this has to be accompanied with some sincerity and with a sense of how the offender will act differently in the future.
If a public apology includes these four elements - naming the harm, taking responsibility, sincerely accepting blame and committing to act differently - then it can help repair a relationship or even save a reputation.
Even if we are to take McCarthy's word that an apology occurred in Greene's case, we are none the wiser as to which parts of her embrace of QAnon and other conspiracies she had said sorry for. 






The day after the Republican conference meeting, Greene took to the floor of the House of Representatives and characterized her past posts in this way: ""These were words of the past and these things do not represent me, they do not represent my district and they do not represent my values.""
She went on say that she had ""stumbled across"" QAnon and ""was allowed to believe things that weren't true, and I would ask questions about them and talk about them. And that is absolutely what I regret.""
So, is this to be taken as an apology? 
Whether Marjorie Taylor Greene has met the criteria established by Goffman is, at best, open to interpretation.
But she isn't alone - good public apologies seem rare today.
'Mistakes were made'
Part of the difficulty has to do with the loss of standards held in common by a community. For a scholar like Goffman, it was taken for granted that an apology reflected common norms of behavior.
Gone are the days when Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy could agree, as they did in their second debate in 1960, that the United States should apologize when it is wrong, as when a long-planned Paris summit in 1960 collapsed after it was revealed the U.S. had covered up spy-plane flights over the Soviet Union. They naturally disagreed about whether the U.S. was in the wrong, but they agreed that apology was sometimes necessary.  






Nixon went on to become an expert in the art of the nonapology, as seen in his response to the Watergate scandal. His ""mistakes were made"" approach, which uses a passive voice to avoid laying the blame directly on oneself, was later adopted by others, including Ronald Reagan over the Iran-Contra affair.
Today's culture is too fractured for most public figures to risk a full-fledged apology. In the U.S., gerrymandered districts, continual fundraising appeals to a base, hyperpartisan media and a polarized electorate have conspired to deliver an environment in which apologizing is fraught with concerns. If one apologizes, it signals a backtracking to the base one is courting. If one refuses to apologize, that rallies supporters and donors.
In such circumstances, it is hard to admit you are wrong much less that you have behaved badly. In such an environment, it is perhaps understandable why Greene's apology was behind closed doors and not delivered in public.


'Never make excuses' might have been a more accurate line for John Wayne's Capt. Brittles.
Silver Screen Collection/Moviepix via Getty Images


The death of the public apology has been long in the making. It fits an approach best exemplified by Nathan Brittles, a character played by actor John Wayne in the John Ford Western ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon."" The 1949 film popularized the expression ""Never apologize - it's a sign of weakness,"" which has become the slogan of a type of public toughness over the past half-century. Ironically, that slogan is misunderstood; Nathan Brittles takes responsibility for the failure of his mission in the movie. The line should be ""Never make excuses - it's a sign of weakness.""
This (mis)understanding of the apology as a sign of weakness has certainly been the mantra of Donald Trump for many years. The former president's style was to attack and insult, playing effectively to a base, and never say sorry. 






Four-star apology
In the absence of public apologies from elected political leaders, perhaps it is better to look to the military, like the fictional Capt. Brittles, for outward signs of contrition.
While Trump avoided taking responsibility over failings in the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the four-star general heading the government's Operation Warp Speed vaccine program, Gustave Perna, was more accountable.
Speaking in late December, Perna took responsibility for how errors in the projections of COVID-19 vaccines to be distributed resulted in states getting fewer doses than they had been promised. 
""I want to take personal responsibility for the miscommunication. I know that's not done much these days. But I am responsible. And I take responsibility for the miscommunication,"" he said, adding, ""I failed. I am adjusting. I am fixing. And we will move forward from there.""
That apology names the harm, takes responsibility, accepts blames and commits to doing better. And it was delivered in public, in stark contrast to Greene's expressions of regret.

164.SayocPicturedwithSoc,"



1.2KQ: Was Cesar Sayoc, the man suspected of sending pipe bombs to high-profile liberals, photographed with ""a Billionaire Democrat donor""? 

A: No. The man in the photo with Sayoc is a retired soccer coach and his former teammate who has no record of any campaign donations.


FULL ANSWER
Cesar Sayoc, 56, is accused of sending at least 15 homemade bombs to high-profile critics of President Donald Trump, including former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and liberal philanthropist George Soros.
Since his arrest on Oct. 26, a photo of Sayoc has been circulating online, contributing to the baseless conspiracy theory that the bombs were a hoax and Sayoc worked with the Democratic Party.
There is no evidence to support that theory. Sayoc registered as a Republican in Florida on March 4, 2016, and voted early in the 2016 primary, the 2016 general election and the 2018 primary, according to the Florida Department of State. A spokeswoman told us the department has no record of a change in his party affiliation.
The photo circulating online does show Sayoc, but it has been accompanied by false information like this: ""Here with Cesar Sayok is Izzy Hernandez, a Billionaire Democrat donor. Now why would a Trump supporter living out of his van, be at a democratic rally, hanging out with a billionaire democrat who gives millions of dollars to Democrats and their agenda?""
Another popular version of the photo includes this text: ""PIPE BOMBER SUSPECT pictured last year with Izzy Hernandez. Sayok does not appear destitute. In addition, why would a Trump enthusiast attend a banquet and have a photo OP with a Democrat Donor/Supporter? Facebook keeps trying to take down this photo,,,pls share this ASAP!""
There are a few problems with those statements. First and foremost, Israel ""Izzy"" Hernandez is not ""a Billionaire Democrat donor."" He is a retired high school soccer coach in North Carolina who played on the Brevard College soccer team with Sayoc in the early 1980s -- the two are pictured next to each other in the school's 1981 and 1982 yearbooks.
Hernandez is not registered with a political party, according to records from the North Carolina State Board of Elections, although he did vote in the Republican primary in 2016. And, according to records from the Federal Election Commission, he has not given contributions to any party or candidate, let alone ""millions"" to Democrats.
Also, the photo wasn't taken at a ""democratic rally"" or ""last year."" It was likely taken at Brevard College's distinguished alumni awards in 2015, when Sayoc's and Hernandez's former coach, Don Scarborough, was inducted into the school's athletic hall of fame. The event was held in Brevard's Porter Center for Performing Arts and photos posted by the school show Sayoc and Hernandez with Scarborough.

15.Thecurrentmonkeypoxoutbreakwasplannedbygovernmentandindustryleaders,"
As monkeypox cases spread around the world, conspiracy theories about the virus are also spreading across social media.
On Facebook, different users are suggesting the monkeypox outbreak was planned by government and industry leaders.
One post is a screenshot of a tweet that says, ""Last year the U.S. government, Chinese government, Bill Gates, J&J, the UN, WHO, Merck and more participated in a monkeypox 'tabletop exercise' where terrorists released an engineered monkeypox virus on May 15, 2022. Weird."" The caption reads, ""Surely this is just a coincidence.""
A Rumble video titled ""BOOM! Caught Red Handed Planning Monkeypox Pandemic,"" referenced the same event.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The notion that the outbreak was planned also has gone viral on social media in China, the Daily Mail reported.
There is no evidence the recent surge in monkeypox cases was planned. Public health investigators are still researching how the disease spread. An adviser to the World Health Organization said the outbreak ""appears to have been caused by sexual activity at two recent raves in Europe,"" the Associated Press reported.
In 2021, leaders from public health, the biotechnology industry, international security and philanthropy gathered for discussion of a simulated scenario where an oubreak of an ""unusual strain of monkeypox virus"" was ""caused by a terrorist attack using a pathogen engineered in a laboratory,"" according to a report by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, the event organizer.
NTI is a nonprofit organization, founded by former U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn and philanthropist Ted Turner, that is focused on reducing biological threats. The organization also led a February 2022 exercise that centered on a fictional virus called Akhmeta.
The 2021 monkeypox event did include the attendees listed in the tweet -- except for Bill Gates. He did not personally attend, but a representative from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation did.

Featured Fact-check
















Instagram posts


stated on June 20, 2022 in an Instagram post








According to International Olympic Committee data, ""an average of 29 athletes under the age of 35 suffered sudden death per year from 1966 to 2004. From March 2021 to March 2022, 769 athletes have died or suffered cardiac arrest.""












By Samantha Putterman * June 23, 2022







The simulated scenario also listed the initial ""attack"" occuring on May 15, 2022, as the tweet says. The first cases in the current outbreak were reported to the WHO on May 13.
The event report said the exercise was aimed at examining ""gaps in national and international biosecurity and pandemic preparedness architectures"" and ""exploring opportunities to improve capabilities to prevent and respond to high-consequence biological events.""
Simulated events have been the subject of misinformation before, but the events are not unusual when it comes to pandemic planning --and they are not proof that pandemics or disease outbreaks are an inside job.
Unlike the 2021 tabletop scenario, though, there's nothing unusual or mysterious about the origin of the current monkeypox strain. Cases linked to the current outbreak have all belonged to one of two previously identified genetic groups of the monkeypox virus, according to the WHO. And genetic sequencing of one sample from a confirmed case indicated that the virus currently circulating matches cases exported from Nigeria to other countries in 2018 and 2019, the WHO reported.
The World Health Organization reported that the virus currently seems to be spreading by ""human-to-human transmission ...occurring among people in close physical contact with cases who are symptomatic."" Cases have been identified primarily among men who have sex with men.
Our ruling
A Facebook post suggests the current monkeypox outbreak was planned by government and industry leaders.
There is no evidence the outbreak was planned.
In 2021, leaders from government, public health and industry discussed a simulated scenario of a monkeypox outbreak. The event was aimed at examining gaps in biosecurity and exploring ways to improve responses to threats.
We rate this claim False.

60.WashingtonTimesRetra,"
On 10 July 2016, Democratic National Committee (DNC) staffer Seth Rich was shot and killed just after 4 AM in Washington, D.C., in a case that remains open.  His death quickly became fodder for myriad unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, including that Rich was covertly working to expose election fraud, was collaborating with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on an unspecified investigation, was about to testify against Hillary Clinton in an unspecified case, and was the person who had supposedly provided WikiLeaks with thousands of leaked DNC email messages.
In May 2017, Fox News retracted a report claiming that Rich had leaked thousands of DNC e-mails to the WikiLeaks website before he died.  In October 2018, the Washington Times followed suit and retracted elements of a March 2018 op-ed column on the same subject.
In that (since-deleted) op-ed, the Washington Times stated as fact that ""data on [Seth Rich's] laptop revealed that Mr. Rich downloaded thousands of DNC emails and was in touch with Wikileaks,"" that Seth and his brother Aaron had ""downloaded the DNC emails and was paid by Wikileaks for that information,"" and that ""Joel and Mary Rich ... confirmed that their son transmitted the DNC emails to Wikileaks"":

Data on [Seth Rich's] laptop revealed that Mr. Rich downloaded thousands of DNC emails and was in touch with Wikileaks. The file with evidence of what was on Mr. Rich's laptop sits with the FBI in a co-shared space with the D.C. police department. According to Ed Butowsky, an acquaintance of the family, in his discussions with Joel and Mary Rich, they confirmed that their son transmitted the DNC emails to Wikileaks.
Since then, the DNC hired a ""spokesperson,"" Brad Burman, a known hatchet man to basically cut off any further communications with Mr. Rich's parents. Interestingly, it is well known in the intelligence circles that Seth Rich and his brother, Aaron Rich, downloaded the DNC emails and was paid by Wikileaks for that information.

As to the last sentence quoted above, in their retraction the Washington Times noted that they now ""believe [it] to be false"" and do ""not have any basis to believe any part of that statement to be true"":

The Washington Times published an op-ed column titled, ""More cover-up questions: The curious murder of Seth Rich poses questions that just won't stay under the official rug,"" by Adm. James Lyons (Ret.) (the ""Column""), on March 1 online and on March 2 in its paper editions. The Column included statements about Aaron Rich, the brother of former Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich, that we now believe to be false.
One such statement was that: ""Interestingly, it is well known in the intelligence circles that Seth Rich and his brother, Aaron Rich, downloaded the DNC emails and was paid by Wikileaks for that information."" The Washington Times now does not have any basis to believe any part of that statement to be true, and The Washington Times retracts it in its entirety.
The Column also stated: ""Also, why hasn't Aaron Rich been interviewed [by law enforcement], and where is he?"" The Washington Times understands that law enforcement officials have interviewed Mr. Rich and that he has cooperated with their investigation. The Washington Times did not intend to imply that Mr. Rich has obstructed justice in any way, and The Washington Times retracts and disavows any such implication.

CNN reported that Aaron Rich's attorney, Michael Gottlieb, said the retraction was part of a settlement Aaron Reached with The Washington Times after suing that news outlet for harm to his reputation and emotional distress caused by the suggestion he had played a role in the supposed DNC email theft:

Police have said evidence indicates [Seth Rich] was the victim of a botched robbery, but in the wake of his death, far-right activists and media organizations suggested something far more sinister. Without real evidence, they peddled a conspiracy theory that said Seth Rich leaked a trove of DNC emails to Wikileaks and was killed in retribution for the supposed leak. The theory was convenient for some on the right as they disputed allegations Russia hacked the DNC, something President Trump had raised doubts about.
Aaron Rich's lawsuit seeks damages for harm to his reputation and emotional distress, among other things, against ... The Washington Times for suggesting he played a role in the supposed email theft.
The suit alleges those people and media companies pushed a conspiracy theory about Aaron Rich that used his background as a defense contractor with technical expertise to suggest he worked with his brother to leak DNC documents to Wikileaks, received money for doing so, and then worked to cover-up the crime.

On 26 February 2017, TheLastLineOfDefense.org published an article appearing to report that seven ""liberal heroes"" were arrested during an Oscar party drug raid:
Oscar night is Hollywood's big chance to come together to celebrate each others' achievements, strut around in a million dollars worth of gowns and tuxedos, show the world how elitists rule our society and then get together for a drug-filled night of partying and debauchery afterward. This year, on the orders of our president, Hollywood would pay for sticking its nose up at our laws, denigrating the good name of our president and protecting the illegal aliens and terrorists we all want gone.
[...]
Arrested in the raid were Allison Janney, Bradley Cooper, Bette Midler, Seth Rogan, Drew Barrymore, Miley Cyrus and Justin Timberlake. They were all charged with providing safe haven for drug abuse, possession of various classes of substances, resisting arrest and inciting violence against the government. The drugs seized at the different parties included cocaine, molly, ecstasy, marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine. Rogan's party also had large quantities of powerful psychotropic drugs like LSD, MDMA and the ubiquitous brain chemical DMT.

58.TheTrialoftheChicago,"
Editor's note: Have you ever wondered if the movie you just saw -- that claimed to be based on a real story or historical events -- was really accurate? So have we. With this year's Oscars featuring historically based movies up for Best Picture honors, we wanted to help you sort out the facts from the dramatic liberties. (We've also fact-checked Judas and the Black Messiah and Mank.) Warning, major spoilers and plot points ahead!
What happens when one of Hollywood's most famous writer-directors undertakes retelling one of the most infamous trials in modern U.S. history?
In Aaron Sorkin's ""The Trial of the Chicago 7,"" which debuted on Netflix in October 2020, the answer is a mixture of accuracy and narrative embellishment. It tells the story of a group of activists who were on trial after they traveled to Chicago to protest U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.
Four days of riots and violence broke out Aug. 25-28 as Chicago police, armed with tear gas and billy clubs, tried to enforce an 11 p.m. curfew in the city's parks, where many of the protesters were camped.
Originally the Chicago Eight, the activists featured in the film faced federal charges of conspiracy and crossing state lines with the intent to start a riot. The defendants included Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, David Dellinger, John Froines, Lee Weiner and Bobby Seale, who was a co-founder of the Black Panther Party. Seale was eventually removed from the proceedings due to a mistrial, dropping the number of defendants to seven.
The trial drew widespread media attention and lasted nearly five months, from September 1969 to February 1970. On Feb. 18, 1970, all were acquitted of conspiracy charges, with Froines and Weiner being acquitted of all charges. Five -- Davis, Dellinger, Hayden, Hoffman and Rubin -- were fined $5,000 each and convicted of crossing state lines with the intent to riot, which carried a five-year prison sentence.

From left, Lee Weiner, Rennie Davis, David Dellinger (with granddaughter), Abbie Hoffman, Tom Hayden (behind Hoffman), Jerry Rubin and John Froiners. (AP)
 
In 1972, all charges were overturned. Among other reasons, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit cited Judge Julius Hoffman's ""antagonistic"" courtroom conduct. In the ruling, the three-judge panel concluded that ""the demeanor of the judge and the prosecutors would require reversal, if other errors did not."" 
The seven defendants and their attorneys were also sentenced for the more than 170 contempt citations handed out by Judge Hoffman. Most of the contempt citations had a seperate appeal with many being thrown out, but not all. 
The movie has received critical acclaim since its release, racking up five Oscar nominations, including ones for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay. 
But how does its portrayal measure up to history? Let's look.

Frank Langella as Julius Hoffman in The Trial of the Chicago 7.  (Netflix)
 
In the movie: Judge Hoffman behaves erratically and shows disdain for the defendants, holding them and their lawyers in contempt of court repeatedly. 

In reality: The defendants were known to disrupt and mock the judge throughout the trial. But the film's portrayal of Hoffman being combative and biased is on the money.
Did Judge Hoffman, who was 74 at the time of the trial, actually treat the defendants and their lawyers as poorly as the film portrays? 
Several accounts throughout history say he did. The judge, played by Frank Langella in the film, was known for enforcing strict courtroom decorum and had a reputation for being a bit of a crank. He was described in Joseph Goulden's 1974 book about federal judges, ""The Benchwarmers,"" as ""impetuous and rude."" 
Multiple scenes in the film show the defendants disrupting proceedings, but the film actually understates their antics. For example, Seale was noted for calling the judge a ""fascist dog,"" a ""pig,"" and a ""racist,"" among other things.
Still, even at the time of the trial, Judge Hoffman's behavior was widely denounced, and the disdain he exhibited for the defense played a pivotal role in the sentencing appeal.
Douglas Linder is an author, historian and law professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, as well as the creator of ""Famous Trials,"" a website that covers and chronicles over 50 famous trials throughout history. 
Linder, who has written extensively about the Chicago 7 trial, told PolitiFact that the judge was quite close to Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, who was furious over the U.S. Justice Department's initial lack of interest in prosecuting protest leaders.
""I was shocked by Judge Hoffman's treatment of the defense lawyers, Kunstler and Weinglass,"" said Charles Henry, professor emeritus of African American studies at the University of California, Berkeley, who attended the trial while in college. ""On several occasions they rose to make objections and were either told to sit down or overruled before they had completed their first sentence. Of course they were threatened and then fined for contempt of court.""
Judge Hoffman issued a total of 175 contempt of court citations during the trial, for everything from argumentation to laughing, blowing kisses and correcting him when he mispronounced names.
In the movie: Bobby Seale has no legal representation in court because his attorney was undergoing surgery. The judge denies Seale's requests to delay the trial or to let him represent himself. 
In reality: Seale's lawyer, Charles Garry, had gallbladder surgery and was unable to represent him because the court wouldn't grant a continuance. 
During the pretrial, Seale was represented by a group of lawyers that included Charles Garry, a civil rights attorney who was chief counsel to the Black Panther Party. Seale believed that Garry alone would represent and fired his other lawyers.
That was before Garry unexpectedly needed gallbladder surgery and moved for the trial to be postponed six months, a motion that Judge Hoffman denied. 
According to Tucker Carrington's ""The Role of Judging 50 Years After the 'Chicago Seven' Trial: A Remembrance of Charles R. Garry,"" Garry promised the court that he would try the case immediately after his operation and recovery. By  Garry's account, Judge Hoffman turned the request down cold, despite having granted several other continuances that morning.
That left Seale without counsel, which he disruptively noted throughout the proceedings.
One thing the film gets wrong is that it exaggerates Fred Hampton's role in the trial. In the movie, Hampton, the chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party, is seen in the courtroom speaking to Seale, giving him advice while Seale is seated at the defense table. But, while some Black Panthers were likely at the trial -- including Hampton-- there is no evidence that Hampton provided advice to Seale in the open courtroom. Rather, the marshals prevented the two from talking to each other.
In Hayden's memoir ""Reunion,"" he says that Hampton did work on Seale's behalf, but in a way that was not so visible during courtroom proceedings. Hampton ""brought messages to Bobby faithfully every morning in court and made calls in his behalf during the day,"" Hayden wrote. ""In addition, a black law student named Mickie Leaner kept the Panther lawyer supplied with legal citations ... which Bobby carefully wrote into his yellow pads.""

In this file photo, attorney Charles Garry, left, greets client Bobby Seale, Black Panther leader, upon his return to San Francisco, Nov. 10, 1969, after Seale was sentenced by Judge Julius Hoffman for contempt of court. Due to surgery, Garry could not be in Chicago to represent Seale. (AP)
In the movie: A female undercover FBI agent seduces Jerry Rubin and shows sympathy for him during the trial.
In reality: Agent Daphne O'Connor is a fictional character, but there were multiple undercover intelligence agents who infiltrated the activists.
In the film, FBI agent Daphne O'Connor played by actress Caitlin Fitzgerald, is shown seducing Rubin, portrayed by Jeremy Strong, and later in the trial appears to show sympathy for him. But the character was entirely Sorkin's creation. Rubin was married to Nancy Kurshan at the time.
There were three undercover agents -- all male -- who infiltrated the protesters and testified during the trial. FBI director J. Edgar Hoover only allowed men to be special agents -- a rule that changed only after his death in 1972. The closest equivalent to O'Connor was Robert Pierson, an investigator for the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, who became Rubin's bodyguard. In his testimony, Pierson said he grew his hair and beard out and dressed up as a biker to blend in with a motorcycle gang.
Thanks to his undercover work, Pierson was able to overhear and later repeat many of the conversations among the Yippies, the activist group that Rubin and Abbie Hoffman led. 
""Basically, the prosecution's case was made through these undercover agents coupled with the activists' public speeches,"" Linder told PolitiFact. ""These agents tried to link things and suggested tactical moves and the specific things they (the Yippies) did that were not public knowledge.""
In the movie: Tom Hayden tells the crowd, ""If blood is gonna flow, let it flow all over the city,"" but intended to say ""our blood,"" meaning only the protesters'. 
In reality: There's no indication Hayden was referring only to the blood of protesters, and not police. 
Experts and witnesses say that Hayden, portrayed by Eddie Redmayne, did not accidentally forget to use the pronoun ""our'' in the speech, as the film implies.
The speech in question took place in the late afternoon of Aug. 28, 1968, at the peak of the week's violence. Dellinger, Seale, Davis and Hayden addressed 10,000 to 15,000 demonstrators at the bandshell in Grant Park, opposite the Democratic Convention headquarters hotel. 
But Hayden didn't want a march to the convention, according to Dean Blobaum, the owner of Chicago68.com, a website devoted to examining myths and facts about the events during the 1968 convention. 
As the rally came to an end, Hayden and Dellinger did have a disagreement (as the movie shows) but it was about tactics. Dellinger wanted the crowd to march to the International Amphitheatre while Hayden wanted people to break into small groups and disperse around the Loop.
They presented the crowd with alternatives, with Dellinger speaking first and laying out instructions to assemble for the march. Hayden spoke next and ended with: ""If blood is going to flow, let it flow all over the city. If gas is going to be used, let it come down all over Chicago. If police are going to run wild, let them run wild all over the city.... Don't get trapped in some kind of large, organized march which can be surrounded. Begin to find your way out of here. I'll see you in the streets.""
Hayden's entire speech was entered into evidence by the prosecution, but we could find no instance in the edited transcripts that Abbie Hoffman was asked any questions about Hayden's words at the bandshell, as the movie shows.

In the movie: Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman show up in judges robes. The judge orders them to take the costumes off, at which point the pair throw the garments to the floor to reveal that they are wearing police uniforms underneath.
In reality: Rubin and Hoffman did show up toward the end of the trial in judges robes, but some reports say it was only Hoffman wearing a police uniform.
Rubin and Abbie Hoffman did show up to court one day in judges robes, but this happened toward the end of the trial, on Feb. 6, 1970, a few days before closing arguments. But there are contradictory reports about whether both men were wearing police uniforms underneath the robes. Some reports say only Hoffman, who is played by Sacha Baron Cohen in the movie, donned both costumes. 
It wasn't the only stunt the defendants pulled. They also brought a birthday cake into the courtroom, bared their chests and placed the flag of the National Liberation Front on the defense table.

In the movie: Judge Hoffman orders Bobby Seale to be bound and gagged over his disruptions. Richard Schultz, a junior prosecutor on the case played by actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt, decries the action and pushes for the judge to declare a mistrial, which he eventually does.
In reality: Seale was bound and gagged for multiple days before his case was declared a mistrial. There's no evidence that the prosecution pushed for the mistrial.
In the film, Seale, portrayed by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, repeatedly interrupts the proceedings, noting that he has no attorney present. Due to his disruptions -- at one point, Seale stands and decries the slaying of Hampton the previous night -- Judge Hoffman orders that Seale be taken away. In Seale's absence, the courtroom is still as the horrific sounds of Seale being beaten off-camera overtake the room. Seale soon returns, bound and gagged.
Seale was indeed seated on trial in an American courtroom, bound and gagged -- but the scene was, by some measures, more brutal than the one-time incident depicted in the film. In reality, he was gagged, tied up and chained to his chair at the defense table for at least three days. And a full week elapsed between the first time Seale was forcibly restrained and when the judge declared a mistrial. 
Blobaum says there isn't a clear record that those in the courtroom could hear marshals struggling with Seale in another room as is depicted in the movie. But he said there was one day, Oct. 30, when those present in the courtroom watched the marshals struggle with Seale, Rubin and Hoffman as Seale's arm came unbound, his chair tipped over and he cried out, saying he was being hit in the scrotum.
""Seale talks a lot about those three days in his memoir 'Seize the Time,'"" Blobaum said. ""He put up a lot of resistance to being gagged, and he was physically restrained by the marshals. Other than what happened in the courtroom on the 30th, he doesn't talk in terms of being punched or abused by them, beyond the abuse of binding and gagging.""
Judge Hoffman's treatment of Seale drew wide condemnation. After a week, the judge allowed Seale's restraints to be removed on the condition that the defendant stop disrupting. Seale continued to interrupt, and the judge declared a mistrial in his case. It wasn't because the prosecution or defense attorneys requested it in open court, as the movie portrays. Kunstler made a motion on Nov. 3 for a mistrial of all defendants, which was denied. Seale's case was severed on Nov. 5.
Sorkin's screenplay also rearranged time. In real life, Seale was chained to his chair on Oct. 29, 1969. But Hampton wasn't killed until Dec. 4.
In the movie: Hayden reads the names of fallen Vietnam soldiers in court at the close of the trial.
In reality: Defendant David Dellinger, not Hayden, attempted to read the names of the war dead earlier in the trial before the judge shut him down.
The film's climactic finale, which shows Hayden reading the names of the Americans who died in the Vietnam War during the trial, never happened.
A reading of some of the war dead took place earlier in the trial on Oct. 15, 1969, when Vietnam Moratorium Day, a massive, national anti-war demonstration and teach-in, was being observed by millions of Americans. 
It was also read by Dellinger, not Hayden. Dellinger read names of both U.S. and Vietnamese casualties but didn't get far before the judge cut it off.

In his historic testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh defiantly accused Democrats and the Clintons of orchestrating a political ""hit"" to keep Kavanaugh off the country's highest court.
The statement was controversial enough. But some heard Kavanaugh go even further, saying that if confirmed to bench, ""what goes around comes around.""
""Perhaps the most chilling line in Kavanaugh's speech was, 'what goes around, comes around.' He did not say it with any evident sadness, nor did he renounce it as a value,"" Jonathan Chait wrote in New York magazine. ""Here was a man apparently threatening revenge on his political enemies, and asking for a lifetime appointment with supreme power of judicial review with which to do it.""
"" 'What goes around comes around' sounds like a threat,"" said USA Today columnist and CNN contributor Kirsten Powers.
U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., took to Twitter to vent on the day that the FBI gave senators the results of its supplemental investigation into allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh.
""After I spend my 5 min today with the single copy of the FBI report I will be thinking of how Kavanaugh calls Democrats 'embarrassments', thinks we are engaged in conspiracy against him on behalf of the Clintons, and promises when he's on the Court 'what goes around comes around'.""
After I spend my 5 min today with the single copy of the FBI report I will be thinking of how Kavanaugh calls Democrats ""embarrassments"", thinks we are engaged in conspiracy against him on behalf of the Clintons, and promises when he's on the Court ""what goes around come around"".-- Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) October 4, 2018


There's enough discussion about Kavanaugh's comments that we think it's important to show his words in context, so you can interpret whether he was threatening Democrats or making some other point.
Here's the relevant passage from Kavanaugh's testimony on Sept. 27, in which he blasted his critics as partisans trying to keep him off the court through what he termed a last-minute smear.
""This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election. Fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record. Revenge on behalf of the Clintons. And millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups.
""This is a circus. The consequences will extend long past my nomination. The consequences will be with us for decades. This grotesque and coordinated character assassination will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions, from serving our country.
""And as we all know, in the United States political system of the early 2000s, what goes around comes around. I am an optimistic guy. I always try to be on the sunrise side of the mountain, to be optimistic about the day that is coming. But today, I have to say that I fear for the future.
""Last time I was here, I told this committee that a federal judge must be independent, not swayed by public or political pressure. I said I was such a judge. And I am.""
Here's the video of the same passage:

Unanswered questions do remain about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, and plenty of distortion has been present in some sources' pursuit to politicize those questions.
In early June 2021, more than 3,000 private emails from Fauci were obtained by the Washington Post, Buzzfeed News and CNN through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. The timeframe for the emails spanned from January to June 2020 and offered a perspective into the United States' response to COVID-19 in the early days of the pandemic. A review of the emails showed correspondence between the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director and well-known public figures, including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and actor Morgan Fairchild.
And what prompted controversy following the release of Fauci's correspondence was a new push by Republican leaders and conspiracy theorists that suggested content in his emails provided evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was manufactured and leaked from a lab in Wuhan, China.
Also contained in the emails were communications between Fauci and an executive at the U.S.-based EcoHealth Alliance, the global nonprofit that collaborated with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and provided some funding for research at China's Wuhan Institute of Virology. As we have previously reported, misinformation peddlers like Tucker Carlson have used this connection to suggest that Fauci was ""responsible"" for the COVID-19 pandemic based, in part, on speculation that NIH-funded ""gain of function"" research efforts resulted in a manipulated form of the coronavirus ""spilling over"" from the lab.
What we do know as of this writing is that there is no evidence of wrongdoing on Fauci's behalf. Though the precise origins of the virus remain unclear, a joint investigation conducted by the World Health Organization in March found that transmission of the virus from bats to humans through another animal was the most likely scenario, and that the lab leak theory is ""extremely unlikely."" However, some political leaders have argued that the report did not adequately answer questions surrounding the origins of the virus, and U.S. President Joe Biden went as far as to order U.S. intelligence officials to ""redouble"" their efforts in finding the source of the pandemic.

53.BlackRockdoesntown75ofAncestry,"
A Facebook post has claimed that the investment management firm BlackRock owns 75% of the genealogy company Ancestry.
This isn't true. Ancestry is actually owned by another investment management firm called Blackstone.
Ancestry was acquired back in 2020
We can see where the confusion might come from, but Ancestry was actually bought by a different, though similarly titled investment management firm, called Blackstone, back in 2020.
The deal saw Blackstone acquire the family history website and DNA testing service for around $4.7 billion, representing around a 75% stake in the company, according to multiple reports at the time.
Despite the similarity between their names, Blackstone and BlackRock are two separate asset management companies. 
Blackstone says it manages $915 billion worth of assets, making it much smaller than BlackRock, which, with around $10 trillion in assets under its management, is the largest investment management company in the world.
What are the concerns over DNA?
The size of BlackRock and the number of companies around the world in which it has invested has led to the development of conspiracy theories suggesting that the firm exerts a sinister influence over global affairs, which appears to be what this post is implying when it claims that Ancestry's new owners--wrongly claimed to be BlackRock--""have a lot of DNA.""
It is true that a major part of Ancestry's business involves collecting and processing DNA from members of the public looking to learn more about their family history. The company's website currently claims to have 20 million people ""in the world's largest DNA network."" Following Blackstone's buyout of the company, concerns were raised about whether the investment firm might be able to access or sell this huge DNA database to other companies.
In 2021, in response to these concerns a Blackstone spokesperson told the LA Times: ""Blackstone has not and will not access user DNA and family tree data, and we will not be sharing this data with our other companies... To be crystal clear, doing so was never part of our investment thesis -- period.""
There is currently no evidence to suggest that this policy has changed. 
In addition, Ancestry told the newspaper that it ""does not sell or share customer DNA data with insurers, employers or third-party marketers."" Its privacy statement states that the company will share genetic information with its research partners only if users provide ""informed consent.""

In early April 2020, social media users shared an essay on Facebook claiming, among other things, that the ongoing COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic was the result of a biological weapon created by the Chinese government.
The essay text began with ""Written by Bill O'Reilly,"" which prompted many readers to write to Snopes, asking whether the former Fox News host and political commentator had in fact written it. 
The essay attributed to O'Reilly amplifies a widely debunked conspiracy theory that posits the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is the result of a human-made bioweapon as opposed to a new, naturally occurring virus. It reads, in part: 
The communist regime has millions of its own citizens slaving in gulags simply for speaking against the government or openly practicing Christianity. Knowing they could not attack us openly they needed to be coy, like a deceptive fox. In my opinion, I believe the regime released a biological weapon upon the world that doesn't kill everyone, but kills ""enough,"" especially the elderly and in-firmed. Back in WW 2 Hitler thought the same way. He got rid of what he considered the useless and rejects of society.
However, we found no evidence that O'Reilly, who currently publishes commentary on his own website, wrote the essay in question. Readers reported spotting the essay on Facebook and also in forwarded emails. But it was not posted by O'Reilly on his website or his social media accounts. We also found no evidence via other news sources that O'Reilly promoted the debunked conspiracy theory that the COVID-19 pandemic was an act of biological warfare by the Chinese government.
In point of fact, the essay's true author appears to be a Facebook user named Tim Besmer Sr., who posted it to his page on April 2 with a copyright notice in his own name and the words ""Permission given for public sharing"" appended. At that time, the post was labeled ""False"" by Facebook's independent fact-checking partners.
We have not been able to ascertain who added O'Reilly's byline to the essay, but within days of its initial posting a version appeared containing both Besmer's name and O'Reilly's, followed by variants attributed to O'Reilly alone.
In a statement to Snopes, a representative for O'Reilly's website confirmed that ""Bill O'Reilly did not write a single word of the essay in question,"" adding that the pundit ""does not traffic in conspiracy theories.""
We therefore rate this quoted item ""Misattributed.""

211.BarackObamawasarrested,"
A conspiracy theory linked to QAnon is using footage from 2013 to falsely claim former President Barack Obama is behind bars.
In a video published Jan. 17, Gage Nelson, host of the conservative podcast America Divided, said: ""Barack Obama was arrested.""
""With over 30,000 National Guard troops in DC, the rumor on the street is that, on Jan. 20, many people are going to jail,"" he said. ""Now there's a video of Barack Obama in a jail cell.""
The clip was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It was more than 42,000 views.
Video evidence of Obama in jail sounds like a shocking scoop. But the footage Nelson shared doesn't show that -- it shows Obama visiting the cell where Nelson Mandela was held during South Africa's apartheid government.

The same clip was published by the Guardian on YouTube. It shows Obama looking around the cell on Robben Island where Mandela was imprisoned for 18 years. The Obamas visited the former prison in June 2013.
Watch for yourself below:

Unproven claims that Democrats will be arrested in the lead-up to Joe Biden's inauguration have circulated on social media over the past few weeks. They're related to the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory, which says President Donald Trump will soon announce mass arrests and executions of Democrats who are part of an underground child sex trafficking ring.
If a former president were in jail, it would be big news. But we could find no evidence that Obama was arrested. We've debunked several similar hoaxes over the years.
We reached out to the Obama Foundation for a comment, but we haven't heard back.
The Facebook post is inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire!

103.IsObamaCommandinganA,"
On 13 February 2017, InfoWars.com (the web site belonging to excitable conspiracy theorist Alex Jones) posted a story reporting a claim that former United States President Barack Obama was marshaling an ""army"" of 30,000 foot soldiers while choosing to live near the White House in order to plot against his successor, President Donald Trump:
Throughout American history, most ex-presidents have chosen to move away from Washington D.C. once their terms have ended, and the vast majority of them have tried very hard not to interfere with their successors.
Unfortunately, Barack Obama has opted for the exact opposite approach. His new home is less than two miles from the White House, and from this ""command center"" he will be directing the activities of an army of more than 30,000 anti-Trump activists. In fact, as you will see below, this army has already been heavily involved in many of the protests and riots that have been popping up around the nation in recent days. ""Sabotage"" is a very strong word, but it is becoming apparent that Obama intends to do all that he can to sabotage the Trump administration, and that is very bad news for the American people.
The InfoWars story is based entirely on a story published two days earlier in the New York Post, which speculated that President Obama (who vacationed overseas after leaving office) is somehow pulling the strings on an army that he operates through the non-profit organization Organizing for Action:
He's doing it through a network of leftist nonprofits led by Organizing for Action. Normally you'd expect an organization set up to support a politician and his agenda to close up shop after that candidate leaves office, but not Obama's OFA. Rather, it's gearing up for battle, with a growing war chest and more than 250 offices across the country.
Organizing for Action officials told us that Obama does not currently have any formal relationship with the group. Meantime the Obamas have reportedly decided to stay in Washington D.C. temporarily to allow their youngest daughter to finish high school. They made no mention of remaining near the White House to act as a shadow administration:
Over lunch with a small group of supporters in Milwaukee, Obama said he and his family plan to stay in Washington for a couple of years after his presidency so that Sasha, the younger of his two daughters, can finish high school...
""We haven't figured that out yet,"" he said. ""We're going to have to stay a couple of years so Sasha can finish"" school, he said. ""Transferring someone in the middle of high school -- tough."" 






The organization's executive director is Katie Hogan, and Obama's name is not listed on financial forms as an ""officer, director, trustee or key employee."" Spokesman Jesse Lehrich told us:
OFA is a non-profit group dedicated to grassroots organizing. We have volunteer-led chapters around the country who are working to engage fellow members of their communities and enact positive change on key issues - it's not a very diabolical endeavor.""
No doubt Organizing for Action, which as of 2014 lists a total of 32,525 volunteers, has been associated politically with Obama, first as a candidate and then as 44th president of the United States. Various iterations of the organization backed his presidential campaigns, and many of its goals involve defending aspects of Obama's legacy, like the Affordable Care Act, immigration reform and gun legislation. Some of its key staffers, like Jim Messina and Jon Carson, are a former Obama campaign manager and White House aide, respectively.
Obama, who is 55 years old, has hinted that he may have a politically active future upon leaving office, saying at a town hall event in North Carolina in October 2016:
Most prominently we're gonna be interested in figuring out how we can develop the next generation of leaders...
Michelle and I, I think, If we look back 20 years from now and can say that we helped to contribute to the leadership of the next generation to replace us and to exceed what we've accomplished, we'll feel pretty good about ourselves.
The former president may well engage in civic activity or political activism in his post-presidential life, and the non-profit group that has been aligned with him for years is engaged in political opposition activity during the term of a president with vastly different policies. Neither of these items are particularly surprising, but neither do they mean that President Obama is hunkered in Washington in a ""shadow White House"" from which he sends forth armies to thwart President Trump.

91.DidMelindaGatesWeara,"
Melinda Gates has been a frequent target of misinformation campaigns during the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. So it was perhaps not surprising in May 2020 when her jewelry raised new suspicions among conspiracy theorists that she -- the famous philanthropist and partner to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates -- had sold her ""soul to the devil.""
In at least three video segments with journalists that posted online between May 7 and May 11 (via Politico, Yahoo! Finance, and NBC's ""Today""), Gates criticized the U.S. federal government's response to the pandemic under U.S. President Donald Trump and discussed the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's work on finding a vaccine to build people's immunity against COVID-19 to end the crisis. On May 8, Gates tweeted:

But it did not appear to be Gates' comments in the video interviews that sparked controversy on social media. Rather, critics fixated on her appearance.
She was seen in a series of broadcast interviews wearing a pink blouse, hoop earrings, and a necklace -- the latter of which conspiracy theorists believed to have displayed an upside-down or ""inverted"" cross that symbolized Gates' alleged allegiance to Satan and denouncement of the Christian faith.  A viral Facebook post read: 







Another popular post, which a YouTuber recited in a May 12 video, said:
Roman Catholic Melinda Gates in an interview on TODAY Show pushing hard for a global COVID-19 vaccine was wearing a bright and shiny upside-down cross around her neck. ... Who likes to wear inverted crosses? Satanists, pagans, witches, warlocks, New Agers, most people in Hollywood.

The claim is two-pronged: that Gates did in fact wear an upside-down or inverted cross in video interviews, including for NBC's ""Today"" show, and that an inverted cross is a symbol of Satanic worship.
While unpacking the former, keep in mind that Bill and Melinda Gates have been major targets of misinformation campaigns by anti-vaccine advocates and conspiracy theorists for more than 10 years, a result of their foundation's aggressive research to curb health disparities worldwide via vaccines, or shots that build populations' immunity against certain viruses.
Yet a new era of dubious claims involving the billionaire couple surfaced during the COVID-19 pandemic, ever since the coronavirus was first reported in humans in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. Doomsday theorists came up with the idea that the Gateses were trying to ""microchip"" or control world populations via a COVID-19 vaccine -- a conspiracy theory that surfaced in various forms, including a doctored image that supposedly showed the words ""Center for Global Human Population Reduction"" inscribed on a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation building.
For the jewelry claim, though, when asked by Snopes if Melinda Gates owned a necklace with an inverted cross, and if she was wearing it during the May 2020 interviews, representatives of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (which handles most media requests for the couple) did not respond to the inquiry as of this writing. 






Upon examination of the interview footage on the ""Today"" show website, for example, Gates was indeed wearing a necklace that appeared to have a charm in the shape of a cross and one of the cross' arms looked longer than the rest.
But here's what makes the answer to the claim murky: It's unclear whether the cross pendant itself had four equilateral arms, like a Greek cross or plus sign, or if it had one longer arm like the Latin cross.
For the former theory, it was possible the Greek cross included a rounded clasp to attach the pendant to the necklace chain and that clasp made one of the cross' vertical arms appear longer than it actually was. That was the case in low-resolution photos of Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of former U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, when conspiracy theorists online raised similar questions about her cross-shaped necklace in 2018. A spokesperson for Chelsea Clinton confirmed that she, indeed, sported a ""Greek Cross or an equilateral cross"" around her neck on ""rare occasion.""
On the other hand, Gates could be wearing a Latin cross, as critics claim. If that's the case, the next questions are these: Did she purposefully wear the cross upside down or did the charm flip unintentionally?
Based on the available evidence, we cannot make that call. We can, however, provide context as to why wearing a cross pendant, even one inverted, may or may not be a statement of Gates' ideologies. 
In several public statements, including a video interview with a reporter for The Guardian in 2012, Gates has identified as a follower of the Catholic Church. The reporter, for example, described Gates as a ""church-going, believing Catholic"" and Gates did not refute the claim.
That piece of her identity could be the reason for why she wore a necklace with a cross in 2020, or not. Nonetheless, according to Catholic Answers, which defines itself as a ""media ministry"" that explains and defends the Catholic faith, even if Gates' cross was upside-down, the piece of jewelry could still be a statement of her devotion to the church. Its website states:
The truth of the matter is that the upside down cross (without a corpus, so not a crucifix) is an ancient symbol of St. Peter's crucifixion. Tradition tells us that when St. Peter was martyred, he insisted that he be crucified upside down as he did not believe himself worthy to be crucified in the manner of his Lord. 






That said, some people believe an upside-down cross is a statement against Jesus Christ, who is revered in Christianity, and in favor of Satan. For example, a 1993 document, titled ""Satanic Cult Awareness"" and sponsored by the U.S. Department of Justice's National Institute of Justice, said an upside-down cross is ""blaspheme of the Christian cross"" and a symbol that law enforcement and criminal justice agencies should be aware of. 

On page 40 of the document:

But many people who call themselves Satanists reject the inverted cross as an official symbol. According to the Church of Satan, which  Encyclopaedia Britannica defines as ""counterculture group founded in the United States in the 1960s,"" the group's main symbol is the Sigil of Baphomet, incorporating a pentagram, a goat's head, and Hebrew letters.
Literature has long depicted anyone who has embraced Satan and thus rejected Jesus as having embraced the reversed cross as symbolic of that act. Satanists are free to employ any symbols which they feel have resonance, so if such an upside-down cross has personal meaning they could use it.

Additionally, for some people, the cross with one longer arm could have no meaning at all. In the words of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod:
Those are people who do not put any significance into using that symbol -- it's just the trendy thing. ... It means that when you see someone with an upside-down cross, you may not know what the intended message is until, and unless, you ask that person.  
In sum, given the fact that an upside-down or inverted cross could mean anything -- including a dedication to St. Peter's crucifixion, not necessarily a symbol of allegiance to Satan and denouncement of Christianity -- and the fact that Gates has publicly identified herself as a member of the Catholic Church, we rate this claim ""Mostly False,"" with the caveat that she did wear a necklace with a cross-shaped pendant for interviews with journalists in 2020 and the position and exact shape of the cross is difficult to discern in available video footage.

35.SynagogueShooterWasO,"
Just moments before the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting that left 11 people dead, the suspect is believed to have posted a final social media rant against a Jewish refugee settlement agency most people had never heard of, but which has increasingly become the target of right-wing rage and conspiracy theories.
""HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people,"" Robert Gregory Bowers wrote on the platform Gab early Saturday. ""I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in.""
The group, formerly known as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, was founded in 1881 in a Manhattan storefront to assist Jews persecuted in Russia and Eastern Europe. HIAS is now among nine groups that contract with the State Department to help refugees settle in the United States, and it has recently clashed with the Trump administration over policies that have throttled the flow of such newcomers.
Analysts who follow the extreme right say the fixation some extremists have with HIAS appears to be fueled by a mix of anti-Semitism and the recent caustic rhetoric about an immigrant caravan trudging slowly toward the United States.
Specifically, they believe Bowers ascribed to the ""white genocide"" conspiracy, which holds that Jews are prominent among the forces seeking to destroy the ""white race"" by bringing in non-white people. The Gab.com account believed to be Bowers' includes several recent postings or re-postings critical of HIAS. 






""Who do they blame for these immigration policies? Who do they blame for diversity multi-culturalism? It's the Jews,"" said Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. ""And so as a Jewish organization that is focused on issues of immigration, that's one of the reasons they were targeted.""
Based in the Washington, D.C., suburb of Silver Spring, HIAS has an annual operating budget of $42 million and receives about half of its money from the federal government. Among the thousands of people it has aided are Google co-founder Sergey Brin and singer Regina Spektor.
As the Trump administration restricted the number of refugees allowed into the U.S., HIAS and its local affiliates went from resettling 4,191 refugees in 2016 to 1,632 for the fiscal year that just ended.
Though HIAS strongly supports the rights of asylum seekers to a fair hearing, it has no connection to the immigrant caravan, said spokesman Bill Swersey.
""We're the people who go to the airport, that bring the refugees home, that make sure there's food in the fridge, make sure their kids know where the school is,"" said Melanie Nezer, HIAS's senior vice president for public affairs.
But right-wing extremists see HIAS in a more sinister light.
Heidi Beirich, who directs the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project, said HIAS's name comes up on white-supremacist message boards whenever posters become angry about refugees or immigrants. She noted that other resettlement agencies, such as those associated with Christian religions, have not raised the same sort of ire.
It happened toward the end of the Obama administration during the debate over Syrian refugees. Attention ratcheted up recently as President Donald Trump and others started drawing attention to the migrant caravan slowly making its way through Mexico toward the U.S. border. 






Trump intensified his warnings about the caravan Monday, tweeting, ""This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!""
""White supremacists are ginned up right now,"" Beirich said. ""Their words are being echoed back to them by high-profile public figures.""
HIAS also has been public in its opposition to Trump's immigration policies. It sued the administration in 2017 over the executive order halting refugee resettlement. In August, HIAS and the ADL led a delegation of national Jewish organizations to the U.S.-Mexico border.
Segal said the high-profile visit this summer could have drawn the attention of right-wing extremists.
As Bowers appeared in federal court in a wheelchair Monday, HIAS-affiliated offices across the country increased security.
Nezer said the group is still processing the tragedy.
""I think we need to redouble our efforts to stand up for these values and not cower and hide,"" she said, ""because to me that would be the most dangerous response.""

Claim:   Barack Obama's education and house were paid for with money obtained from questionable sources.

FALSE

Example:   [Collected via e-mail, October 2008] 







Written by a female Obama supporter who voted for him for president.
Legitimate Questions
To All My Friends, this is every important, please take the time to read it.
This election has me very worried. So many things to consider. About a year ago I would have voted for Obama. I have changed my mind three times since than. I watch all the news channels, jumping from one to another. I must say this drives my husband crazy. But, I feel if you view MSNBC, CNN, and Fox News, you might get some middle ground to work with. About six months ago, I started thinking 'where did the money come from for Obama'. I have four daughters who went to College, and we were middle class, and money was tight. We (including my girls) worked hard and there were lots of student loans.
I started looking into Obama's life.
Around 1979 Obama started college at Occidental in California. He is very open about his two years at Occidental, he tried all kinds of drugs and was wasting his time but, even though he had a brilliant mind, did not apply himself to his studies. 'Barry' (that was the name he used all his life) during this time had two roommates, Muhammad Hasan Chandoo and Wahid Hamid, both from Pakistan. During the summer of 1981, after his second year in college, he made a 'round the world' trip. Stopping to see his mother in Indonesia, next Hyderabad in India, three weeks in Karachi, Pakistan where he stayed with his roommate's family, then off to Africa to visit his father's family. My question - Where did he get the money for this trip? Nether I, nor any one of my children would have had money for a trip like this when they where in college. When he came back he started school at Columbia University in New York. It is at this time he wants everyone to call him Barack -- not Barry. Do you know what the tuition is at Columbia? It's not cheap! to say the least. Where did he get money for tuition? Student Loans? Maybe. After Columbia, he went to Chicago to work as a Community Organizer for $12,000 a year. Why Chicago? Why not New York? He was already living in New York.
By 'chance' he met Antoin 'Tony' Rezko, born in Aleppo Syria, and a real estate developer in Chicago. Rezko has been convicted of fraud and bribery this year. Rezko, was named 'Entrepreneur of the Decade' by the Arab-American Business and Professional Association'. About two years later, Obama entered Harvard Law School. Do you have any idea what tuition is for Harvard Law School? Where did he get the money for Law School? More student loans? After Law school, he went back to Chicago. Rezko offered him a job, which he turned down. But, he did take a job with Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland. Guess what? They represented 'Rezar' which Rezko's firm. Rezko was one of Obama's first major financial contributors when he ran for office in Chicago. In 2003, Rezko threw an early fundraiser for Obama which Chicago Tribune reporter David Mendelland claims was instrumental in providing Obama with 'seed money' for his U.S. Senate race. In 2005, Obama purchased a new home in Kenwoood District of Chicago for $1.65 million (less than asking price). With ALL those Student Loans - Where did he get the money for the property? On the same day Rezko's wife, Rita, purchased the adjoining empty lot for full price. The London Times reported that Nadhmi Auchi, an Iraqi-born Billionaire loaned Rezko $3.5 million three weeks before Obama's new home was purchased. Obama met Nadhmi Auchi many times with Rezko.
All of the above information I got on line. If you would like to check it - Wikipedia, encyclopedia, Barack Obama; Tony Rezko; Valerie Jarrett: Daily Times - Obama visited Pakistan in 1981; The Washington Times - September 7, 2008; The Times May 10, 2008.
Now the BIG question - If I found out all this information on my own, Why haven't all of our 'intelligent' members of the press been reporting this?
A phrase that keeps ringing in my ear - 'Beware of the enemy from within'!!!






   

Variations:   Versions of this item circulated in 2012 were prefaced with an added line stating that it was ""written by a female Obama supporter who voted for him for president.""  That statement is inaccurate, as this item originally appeared prior to the 2008 presidential election.
Origins:    The above-quoted piece combines a good deal of supposition and some elaborate conspiracy theory to question exactly where Senator Barack Obama obtained the money for his education and the purchase of a house in Chicago in 2005.  The answers are fairly straightforward.
As both Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, have noted many times, they paid for their educations via scholarships and student loans, in the process (like many people) incurring debts which were not fully paid off until many years later.  (In the Obamas' case, it was largely the revenue derived from Barack's pair of best-selling books that finally allowed them to retire their student loan debts.)
Likewise, the Obamas' financing of their house in Chicago was no mystery.  The couple experienced a significant jump in income from 2000 onwards (largely from royalties on book sales), and they purchased their Chicago home in 2005, a year in which their combined income was $1.6 million: 








The Obamas' best financial year came in 2005, when their total combined income was $1.6 million. That included $1.2 million in author fees for Obama's best-selling books. Michelle Obama's salary that year [as vice president for community and external affairs at the University of Chicago Hospitals] was $316,962 plus another $45,000 from TreeHouse Foods [for whom she served a member of the board of directors].


The copies of the Obamas' federal tax returns made available on the Internet show that the couple had an adjusted gross income of $207,647 in 2004, $1,655,106 in 2005, and $983,826 in 2006.
During the summer of 1981, Barack Obama traveled to Indonesia to see his mother and half-sister and went on to visit Pakistan with a college friend.  (There is no evidence that, as claimed above, he also went ""off to Africa to visit his father's family"" on that same trip.)  Since Obama had relatives and friends to stay with during that time, his only major expense would have been airplane fare, and it's not much of a stretch to believe that cost could have been covered by contributions from relatives and earnings from various summer jobs he held before and during his time at Occidental College.
As for why Barack Obama went to work as a community organizer in Chicago rather than New York (where he was currently living), he stated quite plainly in Dreams from My Father that he had made multiple efforts to find employment in that field without success and ""had all but given up on organizing"" when he received a job offer from Chicago-based social activist Jerry Kellman after responding to a help wanted ad in the New York Times.
It is true that Tony Rezko's wife, Rita Rezko, bought an undeveloped lot adjacent to the Obamas' home (at a time when Tony Rezko was under investigation by U.S. attorneys) and subsequently sold the Obamas a small portion of that lot, but (as noted above) the house was well within the Obamas' price range given their current income level and they would have required no help from the Rezkos (or anyone else) to afford it: 


In June 2005, Obama and Rezko purchased adjoining parcels in Kenwood. The state's junior senator paid $1.65 million for a Georgian revival mansion, while Rezko paid $625,000 for the adjacent, undeveloped lot. Both closed on their properties on the same day.
In January [2006], aiming to increase the size of his sideyard, Obama paid Rezko $104,500 for a strip of his land.


As Senator Obama explained to the Chicago Sun-Times, the timing of the real estate purchases was dictated by the seller, and the prices were based on current market conditions and competing offers for the properties:


Q: Have you or your wife ever done any legal work ever for Rezko or his companies?
A: No.
Q: How do you explain the fact your family purchased your home the same day as Rita Rezko bought the property adjacent to yours? Was this a coordinated purchase?
A: The sellers required the closing of both properties at the same time. As they were moving out of town, they wished to conclude the sale of both properties simultaneously. The lot was purchased first; with the purchase of the house on the adjacent lot, the closings could proceed and did, on the same day, pursuant to the condition set by the sellers.
Q: Why is it that you were able to buy your parcel for $300,000 less than the asking price, and Rita Rezko paid full price? Who negotiated this end of the deal? Did whoever negotiated it have any contact with Rita and Tony Rezko or their Realtor or lawyer?
A: Our agent negotiated only with the seller's agent. As we understood it, the house had been listed for some time, for months, and our offer was one of two and, as we understood it, it was the best offer. The original listed price was too high for the market at the time, and we understood that the sellers, who were anxious to move, were prepared to sell the house for what they paid for it, which is what they did.
We were not involved in the Rezko negotiation of the price for the adjacent lot. It was our understanding that the owners had received, from another buyer, an offer for $625,000 and that therefore the Rezkos could not have offered or purchased that lot for less.

177.Muellerreportaimstos,"
The Mueller report might not end the debate over what President Donald Trump did, but it has scuttled one conspiracy theory involving a murdered Democratic party staffer and WikiLeaks.
Well into 2017, Fox News host Sean Hannity championed the hunt for details about 27-year-old Seth Rich, who was shot and killed near his home in Washington, D.C., not long before the first WikiLeaks dump of Democratic emails in July 2016. Rich had been working on voter access projects for the Democratic National Committee. The police believed he was the victim of a botched robbery.
Hannity and others thought Rich had been killed because, as the conspiracy theory goes, he was the true source -- not Russia -- of the DNC files that WikiLeaks shared with the world to damage Hillary Clinton.
At one point, Fox News aired, and then quickly retracted, a report that said the FBI had proof that Rich was WikiLeaks' source. (We dug into the lawsuit that Fox News drew in the wake of that broadcast. The suit was unsuccessful.)
The special counsel's report places WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange at the epicenter of those rumors about Rich.
""As reports attributing the DNC and DCCC hacks to the Russian government emerged, WikiLeaks and Assange made several public statements apparently designed to obscure the source of the materials that WikiLeaks was releasing,"" the Mueller report says.
The report quotes from an Aug. 25, 2016, interview Assange gave to Megyn Kelly on Fox News. A couple of weeks earlier, WikiLeaks had offered a $20,000 reward for information on Rich's killer. Without flat-out saying that Rich was the WikiLeaks source, Assange did nothing to dispel the notion on Fox News.
""We're very interested in anything that might be a threat to alleged WikiLeak sources,"" he told Kelly. ""We're not saying that Seth Rich's death necessarily is connected to our publication. That's something that has to be established. But if there's any question about a source of WikiLeaks being threatened, then people can be assured that this organization will go after anyone who may have been involved in some kind of attempt to coerce or possibly, in this case, kill a potential source.""
Assange's fuzzy answer is consistent with another interview he gave. Assange had told CNN in July 2016 that WikiLeaks likes ""to create maximum ambiguity as to who our sources are.""
The special counsel report asserts without a shade of doubt that Russia hacked the Democratic servers and passed that material to WikiLeaks.
Investigators acknowledge that they can't be totally sure how those files were transferred. The material might have been downloaded or hand-delivered.
But one thing is certain: It wasn't Seth Rich.

19.ThatTimeFoxNewsRetra,"
On 23 May 2017, Fox News removed a discredited article from their web site suggesting that Seth Rich, a 27-year-old employee of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) who had been shot to death the year before in Washington, D.C., had leaked thousands of DNC e-mails to the WikiLeaks web site before he died.
The article was replaced by a statement that read:
On May 16, a story was posted on the Fox News website on the investigation into the 2016 murder of DNC Staffer Seth Rich. The article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting. Upon appropriate review, the article was found not to meet those standards and has since been removed.
We will continue to investigate this story and will provide updates as warranted.
A year has passed since that notice went up, so it seemed an apt time for us to look back at the genesis of the story, how and why it came to be retracted, and what Fox News has had to say about it since. The best place to start is with the known facts about the murder.
Seth Rich was found dead approximately one block from his Washington, D.C., apartment just before dawn on 10 July 2016. He had been shot twice. Rich was walking home from a local bar while speaking on the phone to his girlfriend, who later reported hearing voices and gunshots before his phone went silent. Bruises on his hands and face indicated that a struggle had taken place. 






No suspects were ever arrested in what the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPDC) theorized was a botched robbery attempt (even though none of Rich's possessions appeared to have been stolen), and the case remains unsolved to this day.
Seth Rich's death became the focal point of a baseless conspiracy theory holding that Rich leaked tens of thousands of DNC e-mails to WikiLeaks and was targeted for ""assassination"" after the notorious site published them online.
Rumors to that effect erupted within days of the shooting and were enthusiastically promoted by right-wing web sites and social media influencers noteworthy for their support of GOP presidential candidate Donald J. Trump (WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and Trump campaign surrogates Roger Stone and Newt Gingrich, to name three prominent examples).
As the Washington Post and other mainstream news venues quickly pointed out, however, U.S. intelligence agencies had already singled out Russian hackers as the perpetrators of the e-mail leaks, not a DNC insider. That, plus the utter dearth of evidence linking Rich to the hacked e-mails, WikiLeaks, or Assange (despite sly hints from the latter that Rich may have been the source), effectively put a lid on the conspiracist rumblings, which were relegated to lesser-known hyperpartisan blogs and discussion groups as the months wore on.
But 2017 saw a resurgence of the Seth Rich conspiracy theory thanks to a Fox 5 DC (WTTG-TV) report on 15 May (bylined Marina Marraco) suggesting that hard evidence existed showing Rich had been in direct communication with WikiLeaks:
Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death. Wheeler's services were offered to the family and paid for by a third party, according to a statement issued by the Rich family Tuesday which also includes that ""the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.""
Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.
Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich's murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation.
""The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,"" said Wheeler. ""They haven't been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both.""
When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said, ""Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.""
The story had serious problems, however. For one, Wheeler was quoted as saying a police source confided to him that the department was told to ""stand down"" from investigating the case -- an assertion the MPDC flatly denied. For another, Rich's family issued a statement dismissing Wheeler's claims as unsubstantiated and saying the private detective wasn't authorized to speak to the press:
We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth's murderers. The services of the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family. 






The story fell apart completely when Wheeler contradicted himself in statements to other news outlets. He told CNN's Oliver Darcy, for example, he learned of supposed evidence that Rich had been in contact with WikiLeaks from the news media, not from an FBI informant:
Wheeler instead said he only learned about the possible existence of such evidence through the reporter he spoke to for the FoxNews.com story. He explained that the comments he made to WTTG-TV were intended to simply preview Fox News' Tuesday story. The WTTG-TV news director did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
""I only got that [information] from the reporter at Fox News,"" Wheeler told CNN.
Asked about a quote attributed to him in the Fox News story in which he said his ""investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of e-mail exchange between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,"" Wheeler said he was referring to information that had already been reported in the media.
Specifically, Wheeler said in a 16 May interview with BuzzFeed, he had learned about the e-mails while being interviewed by Fox News reporter Malia Zimmerman, whose article alleging Rich was in contact with WikiLeaks was posted on FoxNews.com that same day.
For her part, Zimmerman attributed the revelation to an unnamed ""federal investigator"":
The Democratic National Committee staffer who was gunned down on July 10 on a Washington, D.C., street last July just steps from his home had leaked thousands of internal emails to WikiLeaks, law enforcement sources told Fox News.
A federal investigator who reviewed an FBI forensic report detailing the contents of DNC staffer Seth Rich's computer generated within 96 hours after his murder, said Rich made contact with Wikileaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time.
""I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,"" the federal investigator told Fox News, confirming the MacFadyen connection. He said the emails are in possession of the FBI, while the stalled case is in the hands of the Washington Police Department.
The revelation is consistent with the findings of Rod Wheeler, a former DC homicide detective and Fox News contributor and whose private investigation firm was hired by Rich's family to probe the case. Rich was shot from behind in the wee hours, but was not robbed.
Wheeler told other news outlets he had been misquoted and in fact had no direct evidence or personal knowledge of communications between Rich and WikiLeaks. He first learned of the alleged e-mails, he said, from Zimmerman herself.
CNN reported, moreover, that according to law enforcement officials the information did not come from the FBI, which neither had possession of Seth Rich's laptop nor had conducted a forensic examination of its contents. 
Six days later, FoxNews.com retracted Zimmerman's article and substituted a statement (quoted at the top of this page) saying the piece didn't pass editorial muster. Fox 5 DC, instead of deleting their version of the story, simply added a preamble noting Wheeler had ""backtracked"" on his claim that he had sources at the FBI who confirmed contacts between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks. 






Even as the Seth Rich story was crumbling, pro-Trump Fox New Channel commentator Sean Hannity latched onto the conspiracy theory and continued promoting it on his nightly broadcasts and Twitter, calling on Congress to investigate the murder:

Congress, investigate Seth Rich Murder! @JulianAssange made comments u need to listen to! If Seth was wiki source, no Trump/Russia collusion https://t.co/QPHZwypU34
-- Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) May 22, 2017

Hannity finally relented -- sort of -- on 23 May 2017, after Rich's brother sent a letter to the commentator and his executive producer begging them not to ""drag our family name through the mud"" with ""baseless accusations."" That night, Hannity said on his program that he would no longer discuss the matter ""for now"" out of respect for the family's wishes, then tweeted the following hours later:

Ok TO BE CLEAR, I am closer to the TRUTH than ever. Not only am I not stopping, I am working harder. Updates when available. Stay tuned!
-- Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) May 24, 2017

Fox News would not publicly comment on the matter again until more than two months later, on 2 August 2017, when private investigator Rod Wheeler sued the network, reporter Malia Zimmerman, and sometime Fox contributor Ed Butowsky (who allegedly financed Wheeler's investigation), alleging they had fabricated quotes and ""created fake news to advance President Trump's agenda."" The complaint said the Trump administration not only approved the story but was involved in its creation.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders denied any White House involvement, and Fox News President Jay Wallace issued a statement denying the rest of the lawsuit's claims:
The accusation that FoxNews.com published Malia Zimmerman's story to help detract from coverage of the Russia collusion issue is completely erroneous. The retraction of this story is still being investigated internally and we have no evidence that Rod Wheeler was misquoted by Zimmerman. Additionally, Fox News vehemently denies the race discrimination claims in the lawsuit -- the dispute between Zimmerman and Rod Wheeler has nothing to do with race. 






Fox News employees interviewed by CNN's Oliver Darcy expressed puzzlement over the lack of disciplinary (or exculpatory) action in connection with the botched story despite an ongoing internal investigation. The inaction was ""classic Fox,"" in the words of one Fox staffer quoted by Darcy. ""No one ever gets fired from Fox for publishing a story that isn't true,"" the senior employee maintained.
Another lawsuit followed in March 2018, this time filed by Seth Rich's parents, Joel and Mary Rich, against the same three defendants. Their complaint alleged that the false narrative Fox News promoted about about their son made the Riches ""collateral damage in a political war to which they are innocent bystanders."" The network responded by filing a motion to dismiss on several grounds, including the plaintiffs' failure to plead ""outrageous or extreme conduct"" on the part of Fox News or state a claim for ""intentional infliction of emotional distress.""
The network did not issue a statement to the press, citing the pending litigation.
Indeed, Fox News has neither commented nor issued updates on the Seth Rich story or its aftermath since August 2017, a fact duly noted in a tweet by Oliver Darcy on the one-year anniversary of the story's publication:

One year ago today, Fox News retracted its Seth Rich story & said it would investigate the matter.
Thus far, there has been no disciplinary action announced or update on how it got published. When I asked about its status, a Fox spox declined comment.. https://t.co/hP5jL6Iu14 pic.twitter.com/kYds3oybfU

We reached out to Fox News for a response to Darcy's comments and any other information they might care to share about the retracted article and their internal investigation.
Citing pending litigation, Fox declined to comment.

In February 2021, the husband of U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, was mentioned in an online advertisement. It read: ""[Photos] Marjorie Taylor Greene's Husband Might Look Familiar."" The ad led to a lengthy, multi-page slideshow story with the headline: ""Celebrity Marriages: The Shortest - and Longest - in Hollywood History.""

However, this was misleading. Greene's husband is not a celebrity. Her husband, Perry Greene, was listed as the president of Taylor Commercial, Inc. The company was described as ""a professional general contractor, headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia.""
Further, the Greene family never ended up appearing on any page in the slideshow article. The ad was misleading clickbait ""arbitrage.""
According to this U.S. House of Representatives page, she has been married to him for 23 years. They have three children. 






Rep. Greene previously made headlines about her ""incendiary words"" and belief in the QAnon conspiracy theory. On Jan. 4, she wore a ""Stop the [2020 Election] Steal"" mask on the steps of the Capitol. A deadly riot inspired by the same movement occurred at the Capitol two days later.
On Feb. 4, 2021, The Associated Press (AP) reported that she had been removed from her committee assignments:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, has been stripped of her committee assignments by the House Democratic majority over racist remarks, her embrace of conspiracy theories, and her past endorsement of violence against leading Democratic officials.
Greene, 46, is a newcomer to politics, and previously worked for her family's construction business in Georgia. She was labeled a ""future Republican Star"" by former President Donald Trump, whose political style she emulates. The House Democrats took the unusual step on Thursday.
The story detailed several controversial takes by Greene. For example, she once suggested that the deadly 2017 shooting spree in Las Vegas had been staged. Greene could also be seen in a video hounding a student survivor of the Parkland school massacre.
When California was subjected to wildfires in 2018, she appeared to blame space lasers and referenced Jewish people. She also suggested that a plane didn't hit the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001, and liked a comment that claimed the U.S. government carried out the attacks. Other controversies were covered in the AP story as well.
The ""might look familiar"" text is a staple of misleading online advertisements. For example, we previously reported on an ad that falsely claimed actress Sandra Bullock's young son ""might look familiar."" It also appeared to falsely claim that actor Keanu Reeves was her son.
In sum, an online advertisement appeared to claim that Greene's husband was a ""familiar"" celebrity. However, the resulting article never ended up mentioning the Greene family at all. Her husband, Perry Greene, works at a construction company in Georgia.


Snopes debunks a wide range of content, and online advertisements are no exception. Misleading ads often lead to obscure websites that host lengthy slideshow articles with lots of pages.

The headline of a Jan. 5 blog post that's spreading widely on social media suggests that Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger is putting himself in the crosshairs of an investigation. 
""SoS Brad Raffensperger to Investigate Himself Over Voter Fraud...10 to 1 He Will Find Himself Innocent,"" the headline says. 
This post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The blog post goes on to say that Raffensperger said he was opening an investigation into ballot harvesting accusations.
""Since the 2020 election, Raffensperger has spent all of his time covering up the voter fraud that occurred,"" the post says. ""He is basically investigating himself."" 
Raffensperger, a Republican, has regularly pushed back on false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen, incurring the wrath of former President Donald Trump and his supporters. On Jan. 6, he tweeted: ""One year ago, rioters stormed the Capitol driven by baseless stolen election claims and conspiracy theories.""

The claim in the blog headline that he's investigating himself is not accurate. 
The post references a Jan. 4 report from Just the News, a site founded by former Hill reporter John Solomon. Solomon reported that Raffensperger had confirmed that ""Georgia authorities have launched an investigation into an allegation of systematic ballot harvesting during the state's 2020 general election and subsequent U.S. Senate runoff and may soon issue subpoenas to secure the evidence."" 
It's illegal in Georgia for third-party activists to pick up and deliver ballots on behalf of voters, Solomon wrote, and in 2019, Raffensperger ""led a successful effort"" to strengthen the law.

The National Desk, a Sinclair Broadcast Group outlet, and the Washington Post also reported on the Just the News report. The Post noted that Raffensperger told the National Desk that his office had received the ballot harvesting tip from a group called True the Vote, but that the organization ""does not allege the ballots delivered by couriers were fraudulent."" 
""Those are still lawful ballots,"" Raffensperger said, ""but they've just been handled fraudulently with, obviously, the ballot harvesting.""

Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.
On Nov. 2, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump took to Twitter to rail against a United States Supreme Court decision allowing Pennsylvania election officials to accept mail-in ballots received several days after Election Day. Trump claimed, baselessly, that the decision could, ""induce violence in the streets.""
Twitter slapped Trump's tweet with a warning that the information it contained ""is disputed and might be misleading"" about the imminent election. Twitter also limited the tweet's reach by axing the ability of other users to ""like"" or comment on it, and anyone choosing to share it received a pop-up carrying vetted information on mail-in voting: 
The action taken by Twitter on Trump's tweet was a sign that the free-wheeling days of 2016, when armies of Russian government-controlled social media bots and trolls, political personalities, and media outlets, amplified misinformation in a campaign to influence the U.S., were over.
The warning applied to Trump's tweet contains a link to Twitter's civic integrity policy which states in part:
You may not use Twitter's services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. This includes posting or sharing content that may suppress participation or mislead people about when, where, or how to participate in a civic process. In addition, we may label and reduce the visibility of Tweets containing false or misleading information about civic processes in order to provide additional context. 






Despite these efforts, plenty of misinformation spread on social media on Election Day. For example, a troll impersonating a Pennsylvania poll worker created a hoax on Facebook-owned Instagram, claiming he had thrown out ballots for Trump. The post containing the false information was shared by various Trump supporters with large Twitter followings, including Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr.

You know there is a gaping hole in our sociotechnical security, when a single post on instagram can cause such confusion. Thank you to those on the beat today! https://t.co/n3qPhVAy3Q

Darren Linvill, an associate professor in communications at Clemson University who researches state-sponsored disinformation, told Snopes that yes, things are better in 2020 -- but the bar was set pretty low in 2016.
""In 2016 the Russians were paying for Facebook ads with rubles,"" Linvill told us by phone. ""They were registering Twitter accounts with Russian phone numbers. [The platforms] were so blind in 2016.""
But Linvill cautioned against giving too much credit to the platforms, noting that in terms of recent, major take-downs of foreign disinformation networks, ""We have the FBI to thank for that."" He added, ""It's a victory for everyone who's working in this space.""
But now, Linvill said, there are more bad actors online than in 2016 -- many of them domestic. As an example, Linvill pointed to an October 2020 Facebook take-down of a network of trolls hired by the right-wing political action committee Turning Point Action. The trolls created profiles using fake names and profile pictures, and they commented on posts from mainstream media organizations and public figures ""to create the perception of widespread support of their narratives,"" Facebook's head of security, Nathaniel Gleicher, told Politico.
Linvill also pointed to the fact that Scott Atlas, an adviser to Trump on the coronavirus pandemic, sat for an interview with Russian state-controlled media network RT. Atlas apologized for allowing himself to be ""taken advantage of,"" claiming he didn't know that RT was a registered as a foreign agent. 






Come Election Day 2020, both Facebook and Twitter have mitigating measures which in and of themselves demonstrate that the 2020 election is an election like no other in recent history.
Trump's Election Disinformation
Trump has spent weeks making unfounded statements undermining people's trust in the process. Notably, he has baselessly and repeatedly claimed that mail-in ballots, which played a big roll in 2020 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, were vulnerable to widespread fraud.
Trump has also refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden wins. Public officials and authorities are preparing for the possibility of political violence resulting surrounding the election.
Additionally, Axios reported that Trump may further undermine the election process by prematurely declaring victory if early returns appear to favor him.
Social Networks' Policies Mitigate Potential Unrest
Both Facebook and Twitter have rules against a candidate claiming victory before results are final. They also have measures in place for the potentially uncertain days immediately following the election and rules against posts encouraging political violence.
Twitter's policy against premature election victory declarations reads:
People on Twitter, including candidates for office, may not claim an election win before it is authoritatively called. To determine the results of an election in the US, we require either an announcement from state election officials, or a public projection from at least two authoritative, national news outlets that make independent election calls. Tweets which include premature claims will be labeled and direct people to our official US election page. 






Facebook's policy states that the platform is prohibiting claims in ads that prematurely declare electoral victory and ads that, ""Attempt to delegitimize the election because the result cannot be determined on the final day of voting and/or before ballots are lawfully counted.""
Additionally, Facebook stated:
Getting the final election results this year may take longer than previous elections due to the pandemic and more people voting by mail. So we're preparing a range of policies and products to keep people informed and prevent the spread of misinformation.
For example, when polls close, we will run a notification at the top of Facebook and Instagram and apply labels to candidates' posts directing people to the Voting Information Center for more information about the vote-counting process. But, if a candidate or party declares premature victory before a race is called by major media outlets, we will add more specific information in the notifications that counting is still in progress and no winner has been determined.
On Election Day, Facebook said posts promoting ""poll watching"" activities ""when those calls use militarized language or suggest that the goal is to intimidate, exert control, or display power over election officials or voters"" are also not permitted.
Once polls close, Facebook said it will keep users informed of the ballot counting process:
""If presidential results aren't known for days or weeks, we will help people understand the ongoing process with notifications at the top of Facebook and Instagram, facts about voting from the Bipartisan Policy Center and curated news in News Feed and the VIC.""
Additionally, Facebook said it is blocking ads from foreign state-controlled media outlets.
Twitter and Facebook both said they prohibit posts inciting violence. Per Twitter:
""Tweets meant to incite interference with the election process or with the implementation of election results, such as through violent action, will be subject to removal. This covers all Congressional races and the Presidential Election.""
Linvill said that despite the platforms' efforts, disinformation that doesn't break the law or violate rules can still easily spread. RT and Sputnik, another Russian government-owned outlet, still spread disinformation online. And followers of the dangerous QAnon conspiracy theory still thrive on the platforms, despite recent enforcement actions against it.
""The flip side [to the social media platforms' efforts] is that there are a lot more bad actors than there used to be,"" Linvill said. ""In 2016 it was just the Russians and a few outliers. Now you've got Russian, Cuban, Chinese, a lot of Iranian [influencing efforts]. And, just a whole bunch of domestic stuff. We're our biggest problem.""

201.WhatWeKnowSoFarAbout,"
On 22 July 2016, Wikileaks published a gigantic dump of 20,000 e-mails sent inside the Democratic National Committee (DNC) between January and May of 2016 and hashtagged #DNCLeaks; the release was said to be the first in a series and came three days ahead of the Democratic National Convention.
What are #DNCLeaks, and why were they so controversial?
Initial information on the scope and basic information can be found in an earlier article on this web site, and summarized in an infographic tweeted by WikiLeaks on 25 July 2016:

What's all the fuss about today in the US? WikiLeaks DNC emails. Read them yourself, here! https://t.co/kpFxYDoNyX pic.twitter.com/PElssgFmZV
-- WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) July 25, 2016
Issues of dispute regarding the content of the leaks were legion. Unquestionably, the e-mails demonstrated that the DNC operated as an arm of the Hillary Clinton campaign, planting information in the media to flatter Clinton and damage opponent Bernie Sanders. The revelations were particularly damaging because the DNC was obligated to behave neutrally, and had repeatedly denied the demonstrated favor toward Clinton existed. Following a contentious and later debunked claim Sanders supporters ""incited violence and chaos"" at a Nevada caucus (and threw chairs), former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz both reiterated the now-debunked ""chair"" claim and at the thirty-second mark stated that campaign neutrality was part of the DNC's charter:
 






As the former chairperson alluded during that May 2016 appearance on CNN, the DNC's Charter & Bylaws (current as of 28 August 2015) held [PDF]: 
The National Chairperson shall serve full time and shall receive such compensation as may be determined by agreement between the Chairperson and the Democratic National Committee. In the conduct and management of the affairs and procedures of the Democratic National Committee, particularly as they apply to the preparation and conduct of the Presidential nomination process, the Chairperson shall exercise impartiality and evenhandedness as between the Presidential candidates and campaigns. The Chairperson shall be responsible for ensuring that the national officers and staff of the Democratic National Committee maintain impartiality and evenhandedness during the Democratic Party Presidential nominating process.
The later-substantiated claim was foreshadowed during a December 2015 data breach controversy during which the Sanders campaign was accused by the DNC of accessing Clinton campaign data and swiftly blocked access to a vital campaign tool. The Sanders campaign immediately filed suit [PDF] against the DNC to restore access, maintaining in a complaint that an agreement between candidates and the Committee was violated (as it allowed for 10 days to remedy a breach) and that the Clinton campaign was not sanctioned for identical actions in 2008.  In another controversial communication, a DNC staffer included ""a script for a new video we'd like to use to mop up some more taco bowl engagement, and demonstrate the Trump actually isn't trying."" The language employed was seen by critics as offensive and a cynical view of the Latino vote.  
What happened after WikiLeaks released the e-mails?
The release immediately made massive waves first on social media (where users widely accused Facebook and Twitter of censoring the leaks), before largely reaching the national media on 24 July 2016:
 






  On 23 July 2016, Twitter denied accusations of censorship in response to tweets from WikiLeaks: 
Re: #DNCLeaks: These links haven't been and are not currently blocked. Anyone saying otherwise is uninformed. https://t.co/XjQgwsCu6j -- Twitter PR (@TwitterPR) July 23, 2016
Immediately, social media users seized upon what were perceived as particularly worrisome e-mails among the 20,000 released. Among them were communications heavily suggesting favor to the Clinton campaign, evidence of story-planting in concert with media outlets such as the Wall Street Journal and Politico, an April 2016 drafted announcement proclaiming Sanders' ostensible exit from the race, and a suggestion from DNC CFO Brad Marshall that a member of the press be tapped to smear Bernie Sanders on his religious beliefs.  Media watchdog Fair.org summarized the #DNCLeaks aftermath in a compendium piece, surmising:
While it's impossible to know whether systemic pro-Hillary Clinton bias at the DNC was decisive in the 2016 Democratic primary race, we now know beyond any doubt that such a bias not only existed, but was endemic and widespread. DNC officials worked to plant pro-Clinton stories, floated the idea of using Sanders' secular Judaism against him in the South, and  routinely ran PR spin for Clinton, even as the DNC claimed over and over it was neutral in the primary. The evidence in the leaks was so clear that Debbie Wasserman Schultz has resigned her role as DNC chair--after her speaking role at the Democratic National Convention this week was scrapped--while DNC co-chair Donna Brazile, who is replacing Wasserman Schultz in the top role, has apologized to the Sanders camp. Pro-Clinton pundits were quick to dismiss what was literally a conspiracy to railroad the Sanders campaign as nothing more than a yawn[.] ... what was once dismissed out of hand--that the DNC was actively working against the Sanders campaign--is now obviously true, but not a big deal. This is a textbook PR spin pattern seen time and time again, what might be called the Snowden Cycle: X is a flaky conspiracy theory - X is revealed to be true - X is totally obvious and not newsworthy.
On 24 July 2016, Debbie Wasserman Schultz was ousted on the eve of the convention and was invited to a purely symbolic role with the Clinton campaign.    






Have the leaks been authenticated?
On 24 July 2016, Politico acknowledged collusion between staffer Ken Vogel and the campaign on a piece prior to its submission to editors. The same outlet reported that Marshall apologized for his pitching of a religious smear. Alongside Wasserman Schultz's ouster and an apology to the Sanders campaign by Donna Brazile, the discrete developments were widely viewed as indirect confirmation the leaked e-mails were authentic:

Who is responsible for the leaks? Are Russian spies trying to install Donald Trump as President?
Commentator and Democrat Van Jones vocally denounced the DNC collusion with the media:

Other Democrats took a different stance on the #DNCLeaks scandal. As what appeared to be an actual conspiracy was unearthed in real time, many substituted a second conspiracy in its place holding that WikiLeaks and/or hackers were working with the Russian government in order to essentially install Donald Trump as President.  Fair.org noted that the theory lay largely unproved since first floated by a DNC contractor in June 2016: 
Talking Points Memo editor Josh Marshall (7/23/16) released a rather paranoid rundown the day of the leaks on how Putin was conspiring with Trump (a fairly good debunking of which can be found here), soon after dismissing the substance of the leaks as Russian propaganda white noise. Manysoonfollowedsuit: The DNC leaks as Russian spy operation was the preferred talking point of the day, omitting or glossing over what the leaks actually entailed. The actual culpability of Russia for those leaks, it's worth noting, is still unproven. The only three parties that have audited the hack are contractors for the US government, and the DNC's initial story has since changed considerably. At first the DNC (and by extension their security firm CrowdStrike) said ""no financial, donor or personal information appears to have been accessed or taken,"" but this later turned out not to be true at all. Six weeks since the hack was first revealed by the Washington Post(6/14/16), no one in the US government, including the FBI and White House (who have reportedly reviewed the situation in detail), have implicated or even suggested Russian involvement in the leak-neither on the record nor anonymously. Thus far, all suggestions to this effect have taken place outside the organs of the United States government -- a common and deliberate conflation that even led to this correction in the Vox recap of the situation (7/23/16): Correction: I misread the Washington Post's story on last month's DNC hack and misattributed the Russia link to the US government rather than independent security researchers.
The cited Talking Points Memo piece by Marshall didn't mention the leaks by name nor outwardly connect them to Russia, it simply made a vague case for Donald Trump maintaining a ""bromance"" with Vladimir Putin vis a vis advisor Paul Manafort. On 24 July 2016, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said ""voters need to reflect"" on the possibility floated by unnamed ""experts"" (mentioned multiple times but not specified) that Russian operatives were affirmatively working to elect Trump via the release:
 
Although Mook claimed the timing was suspect, WikiLeaks held:

#DNCLeak: WikiLeaks chose the publishing date. As usual, we published as soon as the docs were verified & as fast as resources permitted.
-- WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) July 24, 2016
Shortly after the Russia conspiracy theory was injected into the news cycle by the DNC and its contractor Crowdstrike Bloomberg reported DNC officials believed drawing such a connection might outweigh voter concern over the content of then-forthcoming leaks: 
The hackers' link to the Russian government was first identified by CrowdStrike Inc., working for the Democratic Party. A law firm reviewing the DNC's initial findings, Baker & McKenzie, has begun working with three additional security firms -- FireEye Inc., Palo Alto Networks Inc. and Fidelis Cybersecurity -- to confirm the link, according to two people familiar with the matter, underscoring Democrats' concerns that the stolen information could be used to try to influence the outcome of the November election. If the Democrats can show the hidden hand of Russian intelligence agencies, they believe that voter outrage will probably outweigh any embarrassing revelations, a person familiar with the party's thinking said.
Almost exactly a month later, Vox reported on 23 July 2016 that evidence from the interim period to support the widespread conspiracy theory was questionable: 
Still, it's worth being clear that there's zero evidence that Trump or Manafort has direct ties to the Russian government. On the other hand, there is significant circumstantial evidence that the attacks on the DNC were closely linked to Russian intelligence agencies. Multiple security researchers have looked at forensic evidence from the attacks and concluded that the attackers used the same kind of techniques that Russian intelligence agencies have used against other targets around the world.
Investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald, known primarily in part for his collaboration with former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden to leak damaging information about surveillance, reiterated that the claim appeared to come solely from Democratic officials (i.e., individuals interested in discrediting the source of the leaks to bury their content): 
@binarybits Just one point: it wasn't really the WashPost that said it was Russia, but just unnamed Dem officials & experts who claimed it. -- Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) July 23, 2016
WikiLeaks also weighed in on the claims, repeatedly maintaining anyone claiming to know the source of the leaks was lying:
Note on sourcing #DNCLeaks. We have, as usual, not revealed our sources. Anyone who claims to know who our source is has no credibility.
-- WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) July 22, 2016
Clinton campaign pushing lame conspiracy smear that we are Russian agents. Last time we were Mossad. Get it right. https://t.co/WrTt175zfe

Clinton campaign pushing a lot of 'Russia' spin to divert from #DNCLeak. We have not revealed our sources & no one disputes veracity.
-- WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) July 24, 2016
Wikileaks also suggested the leak might have come from inside the DNC. Similarly, in a July 2016 interview with Democracy Now! Assange insinuated that the leaks were internal in nature. Moreover, Assange stated that the DNC's ""Russian spies"" claim did not itself agree with the dates it provided for breaches. Assange referenced the above-embedded interview [audio] between Robby Mook and Jake Tapper; Assange stated that the clip was cut off early, and Mook was unable to name the ""experts"" referenced: 
AMY GOODMAN: So, that was Robby Mook citing experts saying the DNC emails were leaked by the Russians. You were the one who released these 20,000 emails, Julian Assange. Where did you get them? JULIAN ASSANGE: Well, what's not in that clip there by Robby is that, just afterwards, he was asked by Jake Tapper, ""Who are these experts? Can you name them?"" The answer was no, a refusal to name the experts. But we have seen one of the experts, so-called experts, that the Democratic Party is trying to base its incredible conspiracy theory on about WikiLeaks. And that is this--what we jokingly refer to as the NSA dick pic guy. He's a former National Security Agency agent who started to produce conspiracy theories about us in 2013, when we were involved in the Edward Snowden rescue, as a means to try and undermine the Snowden publications, subsequently embroiled in some amateur pornography scandal. That's why they don't want to name their experts, because they are people like this. In relation to sourcing, I can say some things. A, we never reveal our sources, obviously. That's what we pride ourselves on. And we won't in this case, either. But no one knows who our source is. It's simply speculation. It's, I think, interesting and acceptable to speculate who our sources are. But if we're talking about the DNC, there's lots of consultants that have access, lots of programmers. And the DNC has been hacked dozens and dozens of times. Even according to its own reports, it had been hacked extensively over the last few years. And the dates of the emails that we published are significantly after all, or all but one--it's not clear--of the hacking allegations that the DNC says have occurred.
Are any additional leaks anticipated?
According to WikiLeaks, the dump was part of a ""series."" However, that outlet didn't provide a timeline for further leaks: 
@Rob_Hoffman We have more coming. -- WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) July 24, 2016

Have the leaks thus far impacted the convention?
As of early on 25 July 2016, the convention wasn't officially underway. But in addition to Wasserman Schultz's cold reception at the Florida delegation's breakfast on that morning, Sanders was cheered by delegates for vowing to defeat Trump but booed for suggesting a goal of electing Clinton:

Bernie Sanders: We have to defeat Donald Trump and we have to elect Clinton and Kaine https://t.co/aezIyyZAOE https://t.co/55ckVZaVnw
-- CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) July 25, 2016
It remained unclear whether further #DNCLeaks would appear prior to or during the convention. In the late afternoon on 25 July 2016, the DNC released a formal apology to Sen. Sanders, his supporters, and the party for their role in the scandal:

328.SaysDemocraticleadersarentwearingmasksorsocialdistancinginprivate,"
One of the many COVID-19 conspiracies circulating on Facebook focuses on the supposed benefits Democrats get from the presence of the virus.
A June 30, 2020, post in a conservative Facebook group said ""hype"" about COVID-19 allows Democrats to limit President Donald Trump's campaign rallies, minimize public attention on former Vice President Joe Biden and to cancel the national convention scheduled for Milwaukee to block Bernie Sanders from gaining support there.
The post includes a picture of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi talking with several other Democratic leaders in Congress.
In addition to facebook, the picture and claim were posted on an array of conservative websites, all implying a conspiracy while asserting COVID-19 hype benefits Democrats.
But the Facebook post added one other element.
The text above the list of supposed benefits says in bold letters, ""NO MASK in private. NO SOCIAL DISTANCE.""
Let's take a closer look at that part of the claim.
This post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook).
Did Democratic leaders including Pelosi huddle up as pictured without standard COVID-19 precautions?
Timing is everything
Pelosi has been a strong proponent of mask-wearing (in contrast to Trump's refusal to wear one in public).
Two days before this Facebook post, CNN quoted her as saying a federal mandate on mask wearing is ""long overdue.""

Featured Fact-check
















Tony Evers


stated on June 13, 2022 in Campaign email








""Wisconsin's archaic abortion ban is older than 20 states.""












By Laura Schulte * June 22, 2022







A New York Times story from a month earlier said Pelosi has ""relentlessly, and strategically, made masks a part of her platform.""
So the allegation of hypocrisy here is noteworthy, particularly with the supposed photographic proof.
But the picture is not what it seems.
The image, taken by Andrew Harnik of the Associated Press, dates to Dec. 18, 2019. It shows Pelosi speaking with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal after the House voted to impeach President Trump, the original caption says.
At that point, the COVID-19 outbreak was just beginning in Wuhan, China. The first case in the U.S. wasn't confirmed until more than a month later. The first stay-at-home order enforcing social distancing wasn't imposed until March 2020, in California.
So, of course, Pelosi and the others pictured would not be social distancing or wearing masks.
And we'll note, Pelosi has been very conscious of mask and social distancing recommendations.
When joined by other Democrats at a recent news conference, the dozens of lawmakers were spaced for social distancing. House committee meetings have been held virtually, and for in-person meetings, masks have been the norm. What's more, Pelosi consistently wears a mask when appearing in public.
Our ruling
A Facebook post shows Pelosi and other Democratic leaders huddled together, criticizing them for not wearing masks or following social distancing guidelines.
But the image is from December 2019, months before masks and distance became part of the national response to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Citing it as proof in a dramatically different landscape eight months later is ridiculous, particularly when Pelosi has actually been a strong supporter of mask-wearing and social distancing for herself and the Congressional body she oversees.
We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

27.MediaOutletTheBLEvad,"
In a series of reports published between October and December 2019, Snopes exposed an Epoch Times-linked media outlet called The Beauty of Life (or The BL) for inauthentically amplifying its content using a massive network of fake Facebook profiles. Part of a sprawling web of loosely connected pro-Trump media properties associated with a spiritual movement known as Falun Gong, The BL played a clumsy game of cat and mouse with journalists --  adapting their methods as previous tactics were exposed.
In our three months' of coverage, for example, the profile photos used by the outlet's fake accounts shifted from stolen pictures, to obvious stock photos, to computer-generated faces incapable of being reverse-image searched. Ostensibly, that game came to an end in late December when Facebook removed the entire network for coordinated inauthentic behavior and blocked all links to The BL from being shared.
Here, Snopes reports that The BL briefly found a way around that link-sharing ban by making a complete clone of The BL -- branding it as a new, unrelated website that goes by the name The Lion. The BL did not respond to our request for comment. The Lion lists no contact person, and its ""About us"" page is blank. This quick-fix operation was no less clumsy or obvious than any of The BL's previous attempts to circumvent Facebook's policies. On Aug. 4, Snopes reached out to Facebook seeking comment on The Lion; a link ban was placed on The Lion the following day. In response to our query, a Facebook spokesperson simply directed us to their ""Continuous Enforcement"" policies that monitor ""efforts to re-establish a presence on Facebook by networks we previously removed for CIB [Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior].""

TheLionTimes.com was registered on July 5, 2020 -- about six months after The BL was banned from Facebook. All of the stories on The Lion, which appear without any author byline, can also be found on TheBL.com (where they do contain an author byline). In most cases, all you need to do to find The BL version of a story that appears on The Lion is to swap out ""theliontimes"" with ""thebl"" in the URL: 







Outside of a shared URL structure, the site betrays other tell-tale signs that both websites are drawing from the same database of material in a coordinated way. The post ID (i.e., the number assigned to the story in each website's database) is identical between outlets, as is the timestamp. This holds true even for stories published by The BL well before The Lion existed.
Despite only a month of existence, The Lion found a large and receptive Facebook audience in pro-Trump or conspiracy theory-focused groups. An article published two days after The Lion's creation garnered over 93,000 Facebook interactions and over 14,000 shares, according to CrowdTangle data downloaded on Aug. 4, 2020:

Snopes discovered this scheme in part because several articles from The Lion were shared amongst a network of far-right, Islamophobic Facebook pages associated with fringe evangelical figure Kelly Kullberg -- a network Snopes first reported on in May 2019.

22.DoesThisPhotographSh,"
In November 2018, a purported photograph of a young Barack Obama began making its way around social media, attached to the claim that it pictured the former president during his college years with Saudi prince Al-Waleed bin Talal:

No evidence (beyond a vague resemblance) suggests that this photograph features Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal. Furthermore, an investigation into the gestation of this conspiracy theory shows that it was pulled from thin air.
This photograph doesn't appear to have any official origin trail. We could not find it archived by news photo outlets such as Getty Images or the Associated Press, nor could we locate it any galleries covering Barack Obama's college years. The earliest posting of this image (sans black arrow) that we could uncover came from a March 2013 Reddit discussion about a different picture of Barack Obama's mother. Reddit user ""einmalistkeinmal"" claimed to have received the photograph circa 2008 and stated it was taken by a friend's drug dealer's father who used to be friends with Obama ""back in the day"":
I have a unique picture of Obama from that time period as well:
I got the picture about 5 years ago from a friend. Apparently their grower's dad used to hang out with Obama, the original caption was ""My dad and Barry back in the day"" 






While this third-hand information is certainly not enough to confirm the context of this photograph (or even document that the man in the white shirt is truly Barack Obama), it does demonstrate that this photograph predates the ""Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal"" claim by several years and was originally shared with a rather harmless caption. (We reached out to ""einmalistkeinmal"" for more information about the photograph but have yet to hear back.)
This unverified image of Barack Obama in college received little attention over the next few years, but in September 2018 a ""Qanon"" conspiracy theorist shared a version which obscured one man's face and offered the picture to followers with the insinuation that it indicated Barack Obama was homosexual:

A number of Twitter users chimed in to guess the identity of the ""masked"" man. While most pushed the idea that the faceless man was actually Michelle Obama (a certain sect of the population maintains, without evidence, that the former first lady was once a man), others posited that it showed members of the Muslim brotherhood, a mysteriously murdered boyfriend, or ""Christine Blasey Ford's uncle.""
The Q community, 4chan, and the pro-Donald Trump section of Reddit r/The_Donald, however, started to push the rumor that this image featured Saudi prince Al-Waleed bin Talal. Why? Most likely to support a small portion of the ever-expanding ""Q"" conspiracy theory which holds that bin Talal paid for Barack Obama to attend Harvard Law School.
No evidence has been presented to show that this person is truly Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal. Furthermore, a side-by-side comparison of the man in the viral photograph (left) and bin Talal from 1996 (right) show that the two men don't bear much of a resemblance. Particularly, Al-Waleed bin Talal has a much lighter complexion than his mysterious counterpart and a mole on his right cheek that the ""mystery"" man does not share:

We have not been able to positively identify the people in this photograph. It is likely, however, that if this image hasn't been doctored, it simply captures Barack Obama with one of his Pakistani friends from his days at Occidental College. Obama's freshman roommate was a Pakistani man named Imad Husain, and the former president quickly became friends with two other Pakistanis, Mohammed Hasan Chandoo and Wahid Hamid.

60.IsLauraPhelpsaCrisis,"
In the aftermath of the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary shooting that left dozens of people dead, some local parents had their names dragged through a cesspool of conspiracy theories and they were falsely accused of being ""crisis actors."" That includes Nick and Laura Phelps, who are the parents of two children who attended the school in Newtown, Connecticut and survived the shooting.
A new wrinkle was added to these rumors after another school shooting in February 2018. The devastation at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which left 17 dead, somehow inspired conspiracy theorists to claim that the Phelps had returned to the headlines as ""crisis actors,"" this time with a daughter who attended Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.
We first encountered this rumor in a 16 February 2018 Facebook post from Melissa Wean:
This is the same twatwaffle who was yelling at president Trump to do something about guns in schools yesterday.
My god the powers that be are becoming so fucking lazy these days. Hire more people FFS and stop reusing the same old played crisis actors.
This poor lady lost two children in two different states in two different mass shooting.
Wake the fuck up people!

This Facebook post is riddled with errors, misinformation, and unfounded claims. For one, we found no record of Phelps ""yelling at president Trump to do something about guns in schools"" in the aftermath of the Parkland, Florida shooting. 






This post also claimed that Phelps' lost children in the school shootings at both Sandy Hook and Marjory Stoneman Douglas. That is not true. The parents have publicly described their fears after their children survived the Sandy Hook shooting:
Laura Phelps, another parent who has two children at the school aged six and nine, described the experience this way yesterday: ""It was like reaching into your insides and pulling them out."" Both survived, but the younger one lost friends.
It should also be noted that a list naming the 17 people who were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas does not include anybody named Phelps or Sexton, the alias conspiracy theorists accuse the couple of using. 
Wean wasn't the only person who tried to connect the Phelps family to the Parkland, Florida shooting. Several other Facebook posts, as well as a Reddit thread on r/The_Donald, claimed that these ""crisis actors"" were posing as the Sexton family in Florida:

Both of these images are years old and neither are related to the shooting in Parkland, Florida.
The top image was taken from a CNN interview with the Phelps family in December 2012 after the school shooting at Sandy Hook (not Parkland). 
The lower image of the Sexton family can also be dated back until at least 2012 when it was shared by disreputable web sites claiming that the Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax. As we noted at the time, these images simply show two different groups of people:
The notion that Homeland Security is employing ""crisis actors"" to portray grieving parents and others connected with the Sandy Hook shootings (such as Laura and Nick Phelps) is based on nothing more than some superficial physical similarities between persons connected to the Sandy Hooks shootings and completely unrelated persons.
In fact, the false claims here make no efforts to offer any sort of verifiable proof. The photos do not depict the so-called crisis actors in the actual act of pretending to be anything. They do not offer support or proof of, say, an interview with a news organization or a timely photograph of either family in Florida at the site of the shooting. The sole string that seems to attempt to connect the Phelps to the Sextons is a passing resemblance to one another. The claims are utterly baseless.
It isn't the first time fake news peddlers have confused people who happen to be brunettes. Laura Phelps was also accused of being the Sandy Hook shooter's lawyer. Although both women had brown hair, they were not the same person.
Conspiracy theorists have been attempting to prove that Nick and Laura Phelps are ""crisis actors"" since more than two dozen people were gunned down at an elementary school in December 2012. These despicable claims were not true at the time and are not true now.

198.ObamaBribedIran400Mi,"
In January 2016, the Obama administration successfully negotiated the release of four Americans who had been imprisoned in Iran in exchange for the release of seven Iranians who had been imprisoned in the United States.(A fifth American prisoner was released separately.) At around the same time, the U.S. airlifted the equivalent of USD $400 million in various currencies to Tehran, sparking conspiracy theories about the timing:
House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) was among those who seized on the timing and cloak-and-dagger delivery method, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, saying it proved suspicions that the Obama administration had tried to hide a payment for the four Americans, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian. GOP candidate Donald Trump called it an example of the administration's foreign policy failures.
""Obama administration sent plane load of cash to #Iran as ransom as part of deal on hostages. Just unreal,"" tweeted Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a long-standing critic of the Iran talks.
As with other issues that would normally fall by the wayside in a normal daily news cycle, the payout to Iran became prime fodder for yet another election-year debate:
State Department spokesman John Kirby joined Bill Hemmer on ""America's Newsroom"" to defend a $400 million cash transfer to Iran during the release of four Iranian-held U.S. hostages.
Kirby said the money had been frozen in a trust fund in the U.S. for decades and it was ""their money.""
He asserted that the fact that the transaction occurred during the release of the detained Americans was ""coincidental."" Hemmer pressed Kirby, saying that it appears that this cash transfer was kept secret and was effectively a ""ransom.""
""It looks bad,"" Hemmer said.
However, the $400 million dollar transfer was actually an openly announced one, paid in settlement of a nearly 40-year dispute between Iran and the United States -- a settlement that likely saved the United States several billion dollars. 






Back in late 1979, after Iranian revolutionaries took 52 Americans hostage at the US Embassy in Tehran, the United States severed diplomatic relations with Iran and froze Iranian assets in America. Among those frozen assets was a $400 million delivery of fighter jets from the U.S. that Iran's previous government had already paid for.
Although the American hostages were finally released a year later, issues such as the frozen Iranian assets (including that $400 million) were not settled at that time. Instead, an international court based in the Hague, the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal was established to deal with such legal claims. The tribunal process dragged on for years and years without a ruling on the $400 million being issued, and finally, when arbitration process was apparently about to wind up (quite possibly not in American's favor), the U.S. agreed to pay Iran back the $400 million principal along with $1.3 billion in interest. If the issue had gone to the tribunal for a decision, as was expected, the U.S. could have been on the hook for the full $10 billion in compensation Iran was seeking.
It is true the U.S. agreed to the settlement at the same time it was negotiating a nuclear deal with Iran and for the return of four U.S. citizens who had been detained by Iran. However, the negotiations over these these issues were conducted by completely separate teams in order to avoid any overlap or suggestions of connections between them.
As Vox noted, charges that the U.S. had paid ""ransom"" to Iran for the release of hostages didn't even make logical sense:
The payment, which sounds really shady out of context, was actually the end of a boring, decades-old international legal case totally unrelated to the hot-button nuclear and prisoner issues.
[T]here was no direct evidence to back up [the ransom] theory. The speculation about timing was just that -- speculation.
Iranian negotiators on the prisoner exchange were not the same negotiators involved in the weapons deal settlement. Therefore, they couldn't make demands of the US team negotiating the weapons deal settlement, which means they couldn't negotiate a quid pro quo of money for hostage release, the definition of a ransom.
Moreover, the basic logic of it didn't make any sense. Iran was going to get that money back no matter what through the arbitration process -- probably more, if the Obama administration was right. Why would [Iran] release potentially valuable hostages in exchange for money it would have gotten otherwise? Iran would have to be the world's dumbest hostage taker.
Even though the Obama administration openly announced the settlement in January 2016, it wasn't until several months later that claims the U.S. had offered a ""ransom payment"" began to circulate due to spin from some Iranian officials. But Vox also noted that spin wasn't too credible:
[One cited] piece of evidence for the payment being a ransom is that the Iranians spun it that way.
But of course Iranian officials would spin it as a hostage payment. This makes them look strong to their domestic audience and America look weak. We don't take political spin from American officials at face value, so we shouldn't take Iranian spin at face value either -- especially when it's contradicted by independent evidence.
By delivering the payment on the same day as the prisoner release, Iranian officials could claim that they got the money as part of a ransom deal.
But the truth is that the Iranians could have claimed that no matter when the cash was delivered. If the Obama administration had forked over $400 million six months later, those same Iranian defense officials could have lied and said it was part of the prisoner release deal rather than the weapons settlement.
The lie isn't significantly more credible just because the cash was delivered on the same day. Nor should American media and politicians help validate the Iranian lie by treating Iranian propaganda as actual evidence.
On 18 August 2016, the Obama administration acknowledged that delivery of the $400 million payment due to Iran in settlement of the dispute over payment for military equipment had been held up until officials were sure that American prisoners Iran had agreed to free in a separate deal were safely away:
State Department spokesman John Kirby addressed questions by explaining that the U.S. held on to the $400 million cash payment until American prisoners were on a plane and safely away from Iran to ""retain maximum leverage."" Kirby said the arrangement did not in any way constitute a ransom payment, as President Barack Obama's Republican critics have alleged.
""We deliberately leveraged that moment to finalize these outstanding issues nearly simultaneously,"" he said. ""With concerns that Iran may renege on the prisoner release, given unnecessary delays regarding persons in Iran who could not be located as well as, to be quite honest, mutual mistrust between Iran and the United States, we of course sought to retain maximum leverage until after American citizens were released. That was our top priority.""

The fact that the money was physically sent to Iran in various currencies  rather than simply transferred by wire may seem odd in the context of the United States' increasingly cashless society, but that was done in order to avoid existing Treasury Department sanctions that banned the use of American currency in transactions with Iran, and international sanctions which at that time kept Iran from accessing the global financial markets (and which were lifted in January 2016).

178.WhatDemocratssaidabo,"
Republicans have been having a field day rubbing the Democrats' noses in the outcome of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. As the summary from Attorney General William Barr quoted Mueller's report, ""the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.""
Donald Trump Jr. said it is ""time to hold the conspiracy caucus in Congress accountable.""
""These Democrat Truthers spent the last 2 years knowingly lying to the American people about collusion,"" Trump Jr. tweeted March 25. ""They've disgraced their offices and should step down.""
The video attached to Trump Jr.'s tweet video featured Democratic lawmakers, all saying in some fashion that there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.
The Trump campaign sent a memo to television producers, listing top Democratic lawmakers and others and sound bytes of their past statements on collusion. It challenged the producers to ask, ""Does this person warrant further appearances in our programming, given the outrageous and unsupported claims made in the past?""
To be sure, we still know very little of what's in Mueller's report. We don't know what his team found and why he decided it fell short of a tacit or express agreement between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.
With that in mind, we wanted to review what Democrats said before Barr's memo came out.  
They used the collusion word a lot.
The 2016 Trump Tower meeting where a Russian lawyer dangled the promise of damaging information on Hillary Clinton loomed large in the Democratic narrative. So did the contacts between campaign insiders and WikiLeaks.
The most common refrain was they believed President Donald Trump or others in the campaign colluded with the Russians. But they generally stopped short at predicting what Mueller would do.
For Republicans, that is a distinction without a difference. For the record, here are some key quotes, with added context from the interviews.
Adam Schiff
As the top Democrat and current chair of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., has been a point man for the Democrats throughout the investigation. In December 2017, he appeared on CNN's State of the Union.
""The Russians offered help, the campaign accepted help, the Russians gave help, and the president made full use of that help, and that is pretty damning, whether it is proof beyond a reasonable doubt of conspiracy or not,"" Schiff said. ""Can you prove beyond a reasonable doubt, (that) will be Mueller's question to answer.""
By that point (see our timeline), the public record included the Trump Tower meeting between campaign officials, including Trump, Jr., and a Russian lawyer, who offered damaging information on Hillary Clinton. Campaign adviser George Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, as had national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The intelligence community broadly agreed that Russia had interfered with the 2016 election.
About a year later, Schiff said, ""there's clear evidence on the issue of collusion,"" in a CNN interview on January 10, 2019.  ""But whether it amounts to conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt, I think, we still have to wait for Bob Mueller's work.""
Schiff tweeted similar comments after Barr's letter was released March 24.
""Mueller did not find sufficient evidence to establish conspiracy, notwithstanding Russian offers to help Trump's campaign, their acceptance, and a litany of concealed interactions with Russia,"" Schiff wrote. ""I trust Mueller's prosecutorial judgement, but the country must see the evidence.""
Richard Blumenthal
""The evidence is pretty clear that there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians,"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal told MSNBC host Chris Hayes Nov. 17, 2018.
Hayes asked if it really was that clear.
""The evidence is there, whether they have enough of it to bring criminal charges is another issue in town,"" Blumenthal said.
A few days before Mueller delivered his report, the Connecticut Democratic senator delivered an ominous prediction.
""There are indictments in this president's future,"" Blumenthal said March 21 on MSNBC. ""They're coming. Whether they're after his presidency or during it.""
Blumenthal was talking about ""the credible case of obstruction of justice that is right now against President Trump, about other crimes that clearly there's evidence he's committed."" That covers a lot of legal ground, so it's not entirely clear what crimes he expected Trump to face indictment for.
On obstruction of justice, according to Barr, Mueller said the evidence failed to exonerate Trump. Barr's decision not to pursue that charge left Blumenthal's forecast high and dry.
Other issues related to banking and tax filings and campaign contributions remain open, so Blumenthal has yet to be proved wrong on that front.
Jerry Nadler
CNN interviewed Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., House Judiciary Committee chairman, on Nov. 30, 2018. Nadler said he definitely saw collusion.
""The fact that Manafort and Trump Jr. met with Russian agents who told them they wanted to give them dirt on Hillary as part of the Russian government's attempt to help them, and that they said fine,"" Nadler said. ""I mean, it's clear that the campaign colluded, and there's a lot of evidence of that. The question is, was the president involved?""
Nadler told ABC News March 3 that impeachment ""is a long way down the road. We don't have the facts, yet.""
""There can be crimes that are impeachable offenses and impeachable offenses that are not crimes,"" Nadler added. ""We have to focus much more broadly on abuses of power.""
Ron Wyden
""When you look at Donald Trump Jr., and what is on the record, there was clearly an intent to collude,"" Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said Dec. 14, 2017.
Wyden's focus was more on Russian money and the Trump Organization -- a follow-the-money approach.
""Their portfolio consisted of a lot of Russian money,"" Wyden said. ""Then the  president didn't disclose his taxes... There's a lot to do here.""
Wyden called the Barr memo ""little more than a public relations strategy.""
""The Barr letter doesn't square with what is publicly known about Mueller's investigation,"" Wyden wrote. ""The indictments and other documents Mueller released revealed all kinds of links between the Trump campaign and family and the Russians. You would think from the Barr summary that they had nothing to do with each other.""
Tom Perez
""Over the course of the last year we have seen, I think, a mountain of evidence of collusion between the campaign and the Russians to basically affect our democracy,"" Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said after the DNC filed a civil suit against the Trump campaign, the Russian government and Wikileaks in April 2018.
Ted Lieu
Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., said it all in a one-word tweet.
""Collusion!"" he wrote Dec. 27, 2018.
""If you look at the indictment that was handed down on Roger Stone, it very clearly says that a senior Trump campaign official was directed by someone even higher to go seek dirt on Hillary Clinton from Wikileaks, which is a front for the Russians,"" Lieu told CNN Feb. 12, 2019. ""That looks like collusion to me. In addition, you have Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chair, handing over internal polling data to a Russian operative, so I think the investigations need to continue before any judgements are made.""
Eric Swalwell
""There's circumstantial evidence that (Trump) colluded,"" Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., said March 19. ""He knew they were doing this. His family was meeting with them. Offers being made. It was being passed to him. He would publicly go out and encourage them to do it.""
Maxine Waters
One of the strongest voices for impeachment has been that of Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.
At a town hall meeting of the Black Congressional Caucus Foundation in Washington, Waters urged activists to press for impeachment.
""Here you have a president who I can tell you, I guarantee you, is in collusion with the Russians to undermine our democracy,"" Waters said Sept. 21, 2017. ""Here you have a president who has obstructed justice and here you have a president that lies every day.""
The March 16, 2017, tweet pinned to the top of her profile shows ""Trump's Kremlin Klan,"" with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump prominently featured, surrounded by the faces of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, Michael Flynn, Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, former Russian Ambassador to America, Sergey Kislyak, and many others.

James O'Sullivan, a special agent with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, died at his home in Metter, Ga., on Dec. 14. 
His obituary did not say a cause of death. But online, some social media users are spreading unfounded conspiracy theories that he was killed in connection with the presidential election. 
""They k_nock_ed him off for investigating the Georg!a e1ect!on$,"" one Facebook post said. 
""Do you all remember Georgia Gov. Kemp's daughter's boyfriend who died in the car crash the day after Kemp called for a signature audit in Georgia?"" another post said. ""Do you all remember the death of his daughters boyfriend was under investigation by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation? Well the lead investigator, James O'Sullivan just died Monday of an 'apparent suicide' in his home. THE INVESTIGATOR IS DEAD... of an 'apparent suicide.'"" 
These posts were flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
We've already looked into another claim related to the person the second post described as ""Kemp's daughter's boyfriend."" 
Harrison Deal -- a campaign staffer for Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., and a close friend of Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's daughter -- died in a traffic collision on Dec. 4. 
A spokesperson for the police department in the town where Deal died said a flatbed truck struck his vehicle from behind, causing him to hit another vehicle and catch fire. Social media posts claimed without evidence that President-elect Joe Biden had Deal murdered because Kemp had called on the Georgia secretary of state's office to conduct a signature audit of ballots there.

168.TuckerCarlsonsayswhi,"
Fox News personality Tucker Carlson claimed white supremacy is a hoax and ""not a real problem in America."" But that's not what the evidence shows.
Speaking on his Aug. 6 show, which reaches around 3 million viewers nightly, Carlson said:  
""The combined membership of every white supremacist organization in this country would be able to fit inside a college football stadium. I mean, seriously. This is a country where the average person is getting poorer while the suicide rate is spiking. White supremacy, that's the problem. This is a hoax. Just like the Russia hoax, it's a conspiracy theory used to divide the country and keep a hold on power. It's exactly what's going on.""
As a social ill, white supremacy is difficult to quantify -- despite Carlson's suggestion that a headcount is easily obtainable.
But the available data suggests a more pressing story than Carlson's take. While the FBI doesn't code incidents as being committed by white nationalists, officials reported a 17 percent increase in hate crimes in 2017 over the previous year, and more than half were motivated by biases based on race, ethnicity or ancestry.
David Sterman, a policy analyst who studies violent extremism at the left-leaning think tank New America, said Carlson's argument amounted to willful denialism.
""The United States has a long history of white supremacist violence,"" Sterman said. ""The claim that it is a hoax is absurd."" 
Here are five points that refute Carlson's claim. (Fox News did not respond to a request for comment.)
White supremacists killed more people than any other domestic extremist group from 2000-16
An unclassified May 2017 intelligence bulletin, jointly authored by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security, found that white supremacist extremists killed more people than any other domestic extremist movement from 2000 to 2016. (The domestic terror classification excludes the Sept. 11 attacks by jihadists.)
The agencies warned that white supremacist extremists ""likely will continue to pose a threat of lethal violence over the next year,"" and cautioned that the ""often spontaneous and opportunistic nature"" of this type of violence makes it particularly hard for law enforcement to prevent. 
Yet the intelligence memo also revealed that law enforcement had managed to foil a mass-casualty plot in which a juvenile suspect, whose phone contained Nazi imagery and language advocating the slaughter of Jews and African Americans, planned a shooting at an Ohio high school.  
The Anti-Defamation League reached findings that paralleled the federal agencies'. As a share of all killings committed by right-wing extremists in the United States over the last decade, 76 percent were committed by white supremacists, the Anti-Defamation League told PolitiFact. Last year, 39 of 50 domestic extremist killings were committed by white supremacists, the ADL's head Jonathan Greenblatt wrote on Twitter in response to Carlson's claim.
.@TuckerCarlson, *white supremacy is no hoax.*39/50 domestic extremist killings in 2018 were committed by white supremacists: https://t.co/9eDBdLxxfm (1/6) https://t.co/gdHaWf7QA9-- Jonathan Greenblatt (@JGreenblattADL) August 7, 2019 
FBI director: White supremacy a 'persistent, pervasive threat'
Carlson's claim is at odds with the view of top law enforcement. At a hearing before a congressional panel in April, FBI Director Christopher Wray was asked what danger white supremacy poses to the country. 
""The danger, I think, of white supremacists, violent extremism or any other kind of violent extremism, is significant,"" Wray told the House Appropriations Subcommittee. ""We assess that it's a persistent, pervasive threat.""
In July, following Wray's appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the FBI said a majority of arrests related to racially motivated domestic terrorism over the previous nine months were believed to be inspired by white supremacy. 
A substantial number of Americans sympathize with neo-Nazis and white supremacists
Carlson said you could fit white supremacists in a college football stadium. We reached out to Fox News and didn't hear back, and we didn't find a solid calculation of how many people this would include.
Experts told us to look at polls to get an idea of how prevalent white supremacy is in the United States.
After the deadly 2017 clashes in Charlottesville, Va., one poll asked Americans: Do you think it's acceptable or unacceptable to hold neo-Nazi or white supremacist views? According to the ABC-Washington Post poll, 9% percent said such views are acceptable. 
As the country has seen a rise in hate crimes among most groups, American attitudes about the state of race relations have soured, according to a trove of opinion polling cited by Brian Levin, who directs the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism.
""Recent social surveys mirror these findings, showing an increase in social distancing and fear,"" as well as reduced tolerance for people belonging to other groups, Levin wrote in the center's annual report.
The Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights organization that has tracked hate groups since the 1980s, says that the number of white nationalist groups grew from 100 to 148 in 2018. Many of the groups on the list are various state chapters of the same umbrella organization. (For example, The Right Stuff is listed dozens of times.)
Rise in white extremist terrorist attacks in North America, Europe and Australia
White extremist terror attacks have been on the rise in recent years. This finding comes from an investigation the New York Times published in April that drew from the Global Terrorism Database and coded attacks carried out from 2011-17 by ideological motive. 
The newspaper defined ""white extremist"" as including white nationalist, white supremacist, neo-Nazi, xenophobic, anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic ideologies. As the chart below shows, the paper identified a surge in the number of white extremist terror attacks in 2015, largely owing to attacks on migrants residing in Europe, with a dropoff in attacks the next year followed by an uptick in 2017:

Source: The New York Times.
Technology is extending white extremist terrorists' reach  
With today's social media platforms, it is easier for white supremacists to share their views.
""We know the rise in violent white supremacy is partly fueled by their use of social media platforms that connect like-minded individuals who are geographically isolated to share hate-filled, violent material,"" said Elizabeth Neumann, an assistant Homeland Security secretary, in recent written testimony for a House committee hearing. 
For example, the shooter who killed 50 people in an attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, drew inspiration from far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik, who killed 77 in Norway in 2011, as well as other perpetrators.
Authorities are investigating an online post uploaded before the Aug. 3 shooting in El Paso. The opening line reads: ""In general, I support the Christchurch shooter and his manifesto.""

39.DidaShadowyConspirac,"
In 2017 and 2018, the FBI's investigation into possible electoral collusion between agents of the Russian state and members of Donald Trump's presidential campaign team prompted many conspiracy theories. Some of them were clearly designed to corrode and undermine the credibility of the investigation and the integrity of those perceived as being hostile or potentially damaging to President Trump, including former Federal Bureau of Investivation director James Comey, former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and those surrounding her, and several other Department of Justice officials, including Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. 
One particular theory -- although it is more a cluster of speculation and innuendo than a coherent theory -- went one step further, targeting former Justice Department lawyer and attorney for the National Institutes for Health Lisa Barsoomian, who is also Rod Rosenstein's wife.
Conspiracy theorists have been speculating and alleging that a shadowy ""deep state"" conspiracy has forced records of and references to Barsoomian (supposedly a secret Clinton loyalist) be ""purged"" from the Internet. In reality, there are ample references to Barsoomian throughout the internet, and her record as an attorney remains well documented in court records over the past two decades. 
Those alleging conspiracies and conflicts of interest in the fact that Barsoomian has acted as an attorney for former United States President Bill Clinton appear to understand little about the nature of a government attorney's work -- or else to be deliberately misrepresenting that reality. In March 2018, the conspiracy theorist web site Patriots4Truth.org wrote:
Barsoomian...represented Bill Clinton in 1998...You may be saying to yourself, okay who cares, who cares about the work history of this Barsoomian woman? Apparently someone does BECAUSE :  Someone out there cares so much that they've ""purged"" all Barsoomian court documents for her Clinton representation in Hamburg vs. Clinton in 1998 and its appeal in 1999 from the DC District and Appeals court dockets (?) Someone out there cares so much that the internet has been ""purged"" of all information pertaining to Barsoomian. Historically this indicates that the individual is a protected CIA operative. 






Nobody has ""purged all Barsoomian court documents"" relating to her role in the 1998 case Hamburg vs. Clinton. This is false. It took us only a few minutes to find that case on a court records database and locate a document written and signed by Barsoomian. 
In 1998, a Wyoming military veteran named Al Hamburg -- an eccentric ""perennial candidate"" and letter-writer who once attempted to register his dog as a presidential candidate -- filed a civil rights case against Clinton in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief.  Hamburg alleged anti-white discrimination by Clinton and claimed that the president was part of a conspiracy to bring about an ""alien invasion"" by Mexican-American military members. He demanded an upgrade to his Vietnam-era ""undesirable discharge"" from the Army, along with three months' pay allegedly due to him since 1967, and ""at least ten thousand dollars.""
Clinton's response to Hamburg's claims is signed by several Justice department officials -- including Barsoomian, who was acting in her capacity as an Assistant U.S. Attorney. The case was quickly dismissed by a judge. 
Far from being the smoking gun in an elaborate, decades-long conspiracy, Barsoomian's role in the case singled out by the conspiracy theorists was utterly mundane, routine, and entirely in keeping with the ordinary course of her job as an attorney in the Department of Justice. The spurious, factually inaccurate claim appears to have originated in a June 2017 blog post written by the controversial conservative political consultant Roger Stone, who was briefly Trump's campaign manager in 2015. On his web site, Stone wrote:
Lisa Barsoomian works for R. Craig Lawrence, an attorney who has represented Robert Mueller three times, James Comey five times, Barack Obama forty-five times, Kathleen Sebellius fifty-six times, Bill Clinton forty times, and Hillary Clinton seventeen times between 1991 and 2017.
Barsoomian participated in some of this work personally and has herself represented the FBI at least five separate times.  It would be great to research the specifics of the cases she worked in, many of the documents from the Court Docket relating to these cases have been removed from the D.C. District and Appeals Court, including her representation for Clinton in 1998's case Hamburg. V. Clinton.
What is especially notable about this particular line of argument is its insidious misrepresentation of the work of a government attorney. 
Neither Barsoomian nor Lawrence were acting as attorneys in private practice, and neither represented Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, anyone else in a personal capacity. As United States attorneys, it would at times have been part of their job to act in court on behalf of the President of the United States and other government officials, departments and agencies. 
Naturally, this also extends to Republican politicians, appointees and Republican-run agencies and departments, something that Stone and other conspiracy theorists fail to mention. As part of their Justice Department duties, Barsoomian and Lawrence also defended -- among others -- Colin Powell, John Ashcroft, and Tom Ridge, all Republicans appointed by former President George W. Bush.

TRUMP, trying to cast suspicion on the more than 80 million votes recorded for President-elect Joe Biden: ""When he made a Thanksgiving Day speech on the internet, they say he had less than a thousand people. ... How do you have 80 million votes if you have less than a thousand people?""
THE FACTS: This is a grossly false tally and one example among many of Trump grasping at the thinnest of straws. Millions of people watched Biden's Thanksgiving remarks.
The bogus claim that fewer than 1,000 watched appears to have grown from a screenshot someone posted on Twitter showing the number of viewers at one point tuned into a single live stream of the speech. But Biden's Thanksgiving address a day before the holiday streamed live on multiple major media sites -- each with its own viewer count -- and netted more than 1 million online views over the first few days, as measured by just a sampling of sites.
A video of Biden's speech on his official Facebook page alone showed more than 540,000 views, and more than that watched on NBC's and ABC's YouTube channels combined.
Biden put out a shorter video on the holiday itself. It registered more than 5 million views on Twitter a day later.

TRUMP, suggesting ballots were found in nefarious places: ""When the numbers come out of ceilings and come out of leather bags you start to say what's going on.?""
THE FACTS: Nothing out of the ordinary was going on. This remark was the latest iteration of a false claim he has spread around about ballot-stuffed suitcases found under a cloth-covered table and tallied without supervision.
A video distributed on social media and shared by Trump featured surveillance footage of ballot processing on election night in Atlanta. It showed regular ballot containers on wheels -- not suitcases -- and both a state investigator and an independent monitor observed counting of those ballots until the job was done for the night, state and county officials said.
Courts and election officials in battleground states across the country have systematically shot down Trump's persistent accusations that the election was rife with fraud.
___
TRUMP on the now-settled presidential contest: ""We're winning this election.""
THE FACTS: No, it's over and Biden defeated him. 






When California certified its presidential election Friday, that put Biden over the top in the Electoral College, pushing his certified electoral-vote total past the threshold of 270 needed to become president. He reached 279 electoral votes and is on track to finish with 306 to Trump's 232 once more states certify their results.
The electors will meet Dec. 14 in their states to make the national result formal.
___
TRUMP: ""We won Georgia, just so you understand.""
THE FACTS: No he didn't.
Trump lost Georgia in an election the state has certified for Biden. Republican election officials have affirmed the election was conducted and counted fairly. No credible claims of fraud or systemic errors have been made.
An audit was initiated by Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, and that triggered a full hand recount that confirmed Biden's victory in Georgia. Gov. Brian Kemp, also a Republican, refused Trump's request Saturday to call a special legislative session to try to subvert the outcome.

24.AntiVaccineChiroprac,"
PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- The flashy postcard, covered with images of syringes, beckoned people to attend Vax-Con '21 to learn ""the uncensored truth"" about COVID-19 vaccines. 
Participants traveled from around the country to a Wisconsin Dells resort for a sold-out convention that was, in fact, a sea of misinformation and conspiracy theories about vaccines and the pandemic. The featured speaker was the anti-vaccine activist who appeared in the 2020 movie ""Plandemic,"" which pushed false COVID-19 stories into the mainstream. One session after another discussed bogus claims about the health dangers of mask wearing and vaccines. 
The convention was organized by members of a profession that has become a major purveyor of vaccine misinformation during the pandemic: chiropractors.
At a time when the surgeon general says misinformation has become an urgent threat to public health, an investigation by The Associated Press found a vocal and influential group of chiropractors has been capitalizing on the pandemic by sowing fear and mistrust of vaccines.
They have touted their supplements as alternatives to vaccines, written doctor's notes to allow patients to get out of mask and immunization mandates, donated large sums of money to anti-vaccine organizations and sold anti-vaccine ads on Facebook and Instagram, the AP discovered. One chiropractor gave thousands of dollars to a Super PAC that hosted an anti-vaccine, pro-Donald Trump rally near the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. 






They have also been the leading force behind anti-vaccine events like the one in Wisconsin, where hundreds of chiropractors from across the U.S. shelled out $299 or more to attend. The AP found chiropractors were allowed to earn continuing education credits to maintain their licenses in at least 10 states.
Public health advocates are alarmed by the number of chiropractors who have hitched themselves to the anti-vaccine movement and used their public prominence and sheen of medical expertise to undermine the nation's response to a COVID-19 pandemic that has killed more than 700,000 Americans.
""People trust them. They trust their authority, but they also feel like they're a nice alternative to traditional medicine,"" said Erica DeWald of Vaccinate Your Family, who tracks figures in the anti-vaccine movement. ""Mainstream medicine will refer people out to a chiropractor not knowing that they could be exposed to misinformation. You go because your back hurts, and then suddenly you don't want to vaccinate your kids.""
The purveyors of vaccine misinformation represent a small but vocal minority of the nation's 70,000 chiropractors, many of whom advocate for vaccines. In some places, chiropractors have helped organize vaccine clinics or been authorized to give COVID-19 shots.
And chiropractic is not the only health care profession whose members have been associated with COVID-19 misinformation: Some medical doctors have spread dangerous falsehoods about vaccines, a problem so concerning that the national group representing state medical boards warned in July that doctors who push vaccine disinformation could have their licenses revoked. 
But the pandemic gave a new platform to a faction of chiropractors who had been stirring up anti-vaccine misinformation long before COVID-19 arrived, driven by interpretations of 19th century chiropractic beliefs that medicine interferes with the body's natural flow of energy.
Chiropractic was founded in 1895 by D.D. Palmer, a ""magnetic healer"" who argued that most disease was a result of misaligned vertebrae. Its early leaders rejected the use of surgery and drugs, as well as the idea that germs cause disease. Instead, they believed the body has an innate intelligence, and the power to heal itself if it is functioning properly, and that chiropractic care can help it do that.
This led many to reject vaccines -- even though vaccines are not within their scope of practice. Instead, they treat conditions through spine and musculoskeletal adjustments, as well as exercise and nutritional counseling. A 2015 Gallup survey found an estimated 33.5 million adults had seen a chiropractor in the previous 12 months.

004.WereUSMarineCorpsHel,"
A right-wing radio host is making the unsupported claim that the U.S. military ""sent a message"" to the Central Intelligence Agency by buzzing the intelligence agency's headquarters with helicopters. Hal Turner, who is also a convicted felon, says he was contacted by unnamed witnesses to a story that was being downplayed by reputable news outlets.
Turner claimed on his web site that members of a ""Marine expeditionary unit"" was spotted at the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency in Langley, Virginia on 18 November 2017.
He wrote:
According to persons who reside near Langley, a large contingent of Marines arrived at CIA Headquarters in tilt-rotor aircraft and when the Marines deplaned, they were armed and moved quickly into CIA Headquarters! (I did not personally witness this and am relying solely on what witnesses are telling me)
Those witnesses also say that a significant number of tilt-rotor aircraft could be clearly seen circling the grounds of CIA Headquarters, parked on the grass around the building.
In an update on 20 November 2017, Turner said he was told:
Someone in the Pentagon/Military . . . . no one will say who . . . made a direct show of force to the CIA on Saturday. It was, for lack of a better description, the sending of a message from the military to the CIA: knock it off. 






The story was picked up by other conservative web sites. But Turner also accused some of them of embellishing his witnesses' account, adding:
Yes, a group of military aircraft approached and circled the CIA Headquarters in Virginia for upwards of 30 minutes on Saturday. They did NOT land and did NOT enter CIA HQ forcibly - or otherwise.
We contacted both the Central Intelligence Agency and the U.S. Marine Corps seeking comment. The CIA did not comment -- but a person did answer the phone there, suggesting that the agency was still operational despite some of the claims that Turner himself has disavowed. A Marine Corps spokesperson, Major Brian Block, told us:
It is not unusual for Marines aircraft to fly to locations throughout the National Capitol Region. I can say right now that a MEU, of 2,200 Marines, certainly did not land at Langley and that claim is ridiculous, as is the idea that the Marine Corps would engage in a ""show of force"" or try to ""send a message"" that way against another part of the U.S. government.
Turner also suggested that other media outlets were ignoring the story. However, we contacted two Washington D.C.-area news stations, WJLA-TV and WRC-TV, and neither station said that they had received similar reports from their own viewers, some of which would presumably work at or live near Langley, or neighboring communities.
The radio host, who was convicted in August 2010 for threatening to kill three federal judges, also attempted to link the story with other conspiracy theories through another claim:
The number of SEALED INDICTMENTS presently on US District Court Dockets across the United States has reached an astonishing 1800 as of Friday, November 17. These Sealed Indictments began appearing on US District Court Dockets on October 31.
There have never been this many Sealed Indictments showing on federal court Dockets at the same time . . . ever.
The existence of so many sealed Indictments has lead others to suggest that large groups of federal officials - perhaps including elected officials - are facing mass arrest over a number of corruption-related activities such as ""pay-to-play"" the UraniumOne conspiracy, Pedophile Rings and other criminal activities, and these troops may be needed to keep order once the high officials start being taken under arrest.
A spokesperson for the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts told us that their office does not keep statistics regarding the number of sealed indictments. Meanwhile, both the UraniumOne and Pizzagate conspiracies have been roundly debunked.
Turner also operated Superstation 95, a web site that has pushed conspiracy theories concerning the mass shootings in San Bernardino and Orlando, among other topics.
The Southern Poverty Law Center has described Turner as ""a white supremacist true believer who has used radio and Internet broadcasts to disseminate his hate since the 1990s.""

Intermittently, rumors have circulated on social media holding that the United States government was found guilty in 1999 of conspiring to assassinate Martin Luther King, Jr. Furthermore, according to these rumors, the reason this relatively new information (King was murdered on 4 April 1968) comes as a surprise to many is the ""mainstream media"" intentionally suppressed it after the government's role in King's death was exposed:

It's common for exaggerated claims to contain a few elements of truth, and that factor comes into play in this conspiracy theory rumor for a few reasons. One is rudimentary research would confirm the claim's basics (i.e., the verdict in a wrongful death civil action did allow that ""government agencies"" participated in a conspiracy to assassinate Dr. King), leading readers to believe the entirety of the rumor was factual. Another is the shaky foundation on which the conspiracy theory rests is a matter of some nuance. As well, the gravity of the trial's supposed conclusion, when contrasted with the relatively little public discussion of that addendum to King's life, has lent credence to the belief the trial in question and its outcome were deliberately omitted from the news.
Historical figures like Martin Luther King, Jr. tend to be the subject of complicated conspiracy theories, particularly when they are vectors for widespread societal change. The man who was charged with King's murder, James Earl Ray, confessed to the crime and pled guilty; he then recanted his confession, hinted at a conspiracy, and sought to withdraw his guilty plea and secure a trial. However, any claim made by Ray about his guilt or innocence should be weighed against his strong incentive to be freed from prison (where he died in 1998).
Also at issue is the difference between Ray's guilty plea in 1969, which avoided his undergoing a criminal trial, and the case cited by the rumors, which was a civil trial heard in 1999. The latter (King vs. Jowers) was a civil suit brought by agents of King's estate (including his widow, Coretta Scott King) against a man named Loyd Jowers, who claimed to have taken part in a conspiracy to assassinate King. In a criminal trial the guilt of the defendant must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, but in a civil suit the plaintiff need only support his claim with a preponderance of evidence to prevail. 






Loyd Jowers was a Memphis restaurant owner who inserted himself into the narrative about King's death in the course of a 1993 television interview during which he claimed to have been party to a larger conspiracy to assassinate King. However, Jowers had long asserted he had no involvement in the event before suddenly and bizarrely claiming, twenty-five years after the fact, he had been paid to hire a hit man to kill Martin Luther King. He then repudiated his claims when required to testify to them under oath:
At the time of the assassination, Loyd Jowers owned and operated Jim's Grill, a tavern below the rooming house where James Earl Ray rented a room on April 4, 1968. Until 1993, Jowers maintained in several public statements that he was merely serving customers in his tavern when Dr. King was shot. He did not claim any involvement in the assassination or significant knowledge about it.
In December 1993, Jowers appeared on ABC's Prime Time Live and radically changed his story, claiming he participated in a plot to assassinate Dr. King. According to Jowers, a Memphis produce dealer, who was involved with the Mafia, gave him $100,000 to hire an assassin and assured him that the police would not be at the scene of the shooting. Jowers also reported that he hired a hit man to shoot Dr. King from behind Jim's Grill and received the murder weapon prior to the killing from someone with a name sounding like Raoul. Jowers further maintained that Ray did not shoot Dr. King and that he did not believe Ray knowingly participated in the conspiracy.
Since his television appearance, Jowers and his attorney have given additional statements about the assassination to the media, the King family, Ray's defenders, law enforcement personnel, relatives, friends, and courts. Jowers, however, has never made his conspiracy claims under oath. In fact, he did not testify in King v. Jowers, despite the fact that he was the party being sued. The one time Jowers did testify under oath about his allegations in an earlier civil suit, Ray v. Jowers, he repudiated them. Further, he has also renounced his confessions in certain private conversations without his attorney. For example, in an impromptu, recorded conversation with a state investigator, Jowers characterized a central feature of his story -- that someone besides Ray shot Dr. King with a rifle other than the one recovered at the crime scene -- as ""bullshit."" Consequently, Jowers has only confessed in circumstances where candor has not been required by law or where he has not been required to reconcile his prior inconsistencies.
The U.S. Department of Justice found Jowers' claims were without merit and explained that he'd never been able to provide any support for later assertions about his involvement in King's death:
When Jowers has confessed, he has contradicted himself on virtually every key point about the alleged conspiracy. For example, he not only identified two different people as the assassin, but also most recently claimed that he saw the assassin and did not recognize him. Jowers also abandoned his initial allegation that he received $100,000 with which he hired a hit man to kill Dr. King, claiming instead that he merely held the money for the conspirators. Additionally, Jowers has been inconsistent about other aspects of the alleged conspiracy, including his role in it, Raoul's responsibilities, whether and how Memphis police officers were involved, and the disposal of the alleged murder weapon.
Furthermore, the Justice Department's investigation determined no physical evidence whatsoever supported Jowers' multiple and conflicting accounts of his involvement in King's assassination, and Jowers stood to profit from his assertions:
It was not until 1993, during a meeting with the producer of a televised mock trial of James Earl Ray, that Jowers first publicly disclosed the details of the alleged plot, including the names of the purported assassin and other co-conspirators. He also initially sought compensation for his story, and his friends and relatives acknowledge that he hoped to make money from his account.
In summary, we have determined that Jowers' claims about an alleged conspiracy are materially contradictory and unsubstantiated. Moreover, Jowers' repudiations, even under oath, his failure to testify during King v. Jowers, his refusal to cooperate with our investigation, his reported motive to make money from his claims, and his efforts along with his friends to promote his story all suggest a lack of credibility. We do not believe that Jowers, or those he accuses, participated in the assassination of Dr. King.
Unfortunately, the jury who heard the case of King vs. Jowers (in which the King family was represented by James Earl Ray's former lawyer, William Pepper) returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, holding that Loyd Jowers had participated in a conspiracy to kill King, and that ""governmental agencies"" were party to the conspiracy:
THE COURT: In answer to the question did Loyd Jowers participate in a conspiracy to do harm to Dr. Martin Luther King, your answer is yes. Do you also find that others, including governmental agencies, were parties to this conspiracy as alleged by the defendant? Your answer to that one is also yes. And the total amount of damages you find for the plaintiffs entitled to is one hundred dollars. Is that your verdict?
THE JURY: Yes (In unison). 






However, the verdict was of no real significance given that virtually nothing was at stake (this was not a criminal trial, and the defendant was only being sued for a mere $100 and thus had little motivation for vigorously defending himself), allowing the King family to present a mostly unopposed version of events and guide the jury to return the verdict they desired. As noted in the New York Times' report of the verdict, the one-sided presentation of the case allowed for no other result:
John Campbell, an assistant district attorney in Memphis, who was not part of the civil proceedings but was part of the criminal case against Mr. Ray, said, ""I'm not surprised by the verdict. This case overlooked so much contradictory evidence that never was presented, what other option did the jury have but to accept Mr. Pepper's version?""
And Gerald Posner, whose recent book, ""Killing the Dream"" made the case that Mr. Ray was the killer, said, ""It distresses me greatly that the legal system was used in such a callous and farcical manner in Memphis. If the King family wanted a rubber stamp of their own view of the facts, they got it.""
The Justice Department also found the evidence presented in the civil trial to be lacking in credibility:
The evidence introduced in King v. Jowers to support various conspiracy allegations consisted of either inaccurate and incomplete information or unsubstantiated conjecture, supplied most often by sources, many unnamed, who did not testify. Important information from the historical record and our investigation contradicts and undermines it. When considered in light of all other available relevant facts, the trial's evidence fails to establish the existence of any conspiracy to kill Dr. King. The verdict presented by the parties and adopted by the jury is incompatible with the weight of all relevant information, much of which the jury never heard.
All of this is therefore a very slender thread on which to hang the claim that the ""U.S. government was proved responsible for King's assassination."" (In the event, the verdict referred only to ""governmental agencies"" rather than the U.S. government specifically, a term that could include anything from local police to the CIA.) And contrary to the rumor's assertion, the 1999 civil case involving Jowers was widely reported by major news outlets at the time (including, as referenced above, the New York Times).
More to the point, however, Jowers (who didn't even testify) was the only named party in the civil suit brought by the King family, and the judgment awarded in that case was a paltry $100, widely described as a token award to mark the trial's outcome. No other parties (including any branches or agents of the United States Government) were named as defendants in King v. Jowers, and no identification was provided by Jowers of the purported other parties with whom he colluded to assassinate King. By all accounts, the two main parties involved, the King family and Jowers, had disparate goals served by the civil suit's outcome; and no substantive evidence was presented to establish any of the claims made by Jowers had any merit.
In a statement about the 1999 civil suit, Coretta Scott King cited several unrelated and unspecified agents in her description of the parties she believed were responsible for her husband's murder:
There is abundant evidence of a major high level conspiracy in the assassination of my husband, Martin Luther King, Jr. And the civil court's unanimous verdict has validated our belief. I wholeheartedly applaud the verdict of the jury and I feel that justice has been well served in their deliberations. This verdict is not only a great victory for my family, but also a great victory for America. It is a great victory for truth itself. It is important to know that this was a SWIFT verdict, delivered after about an hour of jury deliberation. The jury was clearly convinced by the extensive evidence that was presented during the trial that, in addition to Mr. Jowers, the conspiracy of the Mafia, local, state and federal government agencies, were deeply involved in the assassination of my husband. The jury also affirmed overwhelming evidence that identified someone else, not James Earl Ray, as the shooter, and that Mr. Ray was set up to take the blame. I want to make it clear that my family has no interest in retribution. Instead, our sole concern has been that the full truth of the assassination has been revealed and adjudicated in a court of law.
The one thing the conspiracy rumor correctly states is a 1999 civil trial reached a verdict that cited the existence of a conspiracy to assassinate Martin Luther King, Jr. What it neglects to mention is the relative worth of such a judgment: The verdict in question was civil rather than criminal, the sole named defendant was someone who stood to gain both publicity and money from repeating his claims, and the King family's motivation in bringing the suit was to validate their long-held suspicions a larger conspiracy was at play in the death of the civil rights leader. Given the minor sum of money awarded, a jury would have little incentive to not find in favor of an account supported by both sides of a flawed case.
The U.S. Justice Department concluded in June 2000 the ""allegations originating with Loyd Jowers ... are not credible"":
After reviewing all available materials from prior official investigations and other sources, including the evidence from King v. Jowers, and after conducting a year and a half of original investigation, we have concluded that the allegations originating with Loyd Jowers and Donald Wilson are not credible.
We found no reliable evidence to support Jowers' allegations that he conspired with others to shoot Dr. King from behind Jim's Grill. In fact, credible evidence contradicting his allegations, as well as material inconsistencies among his accounts and his own repudiations of them, demonstrate that Jowers has not been truthful. Rather, it appears that Jowers contrived and promoted a sensational story of a plot to kill Dr. King.
Questions and speculation may always surround the assassination of Dr. King and other national tragedies. Our investigation of these most recent allegations, as well as several exhaustive previous official investigations, found no reliable evidence that Dr. King was killed by conspirators who framed James Earl Ray. Nor have any of the conspiracy theories advanced in the last 30 years, including the Jowers and the Wilson allegations, survived critical examination.

04.DidSorosDecideThatHa,"
A quote ostensibly uttered by Alexander Soros, the son of billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros, has been making its way around social media since at least Aug. 12, 2020. The fictitious quote, which involved Soros saying that it was his -- and in turn his father's -- decision to pick U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., as 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's running mate, was frequently shared with a photograph that social media users claimed was taken right after Soros conducted the final interview in Harris' vetting process:

This is a genuine photograph of Soros and Harris, but this quote was fabricated out of whole cloth, and this photograph does not show Soros and Harris after the ""final interview"" before Harris was selected as Biden's running mate. This image was actually taken in March 2019. 
The above-displayed meme reads:
Alexander Soros, son of George Soros, here with Kamala Harris after their final interview in Biden's VP vetting process. ""This was the moment,"" Soros said. ""When I decided she would be the pick. I told my dad and he agreed. The rest was just a formality."" 






For the uninitiated, George Soros, who is known for giving both verbal and financial support to progressive causes, frequently plays the ""boogeyman"" in right-wing, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. The billionaire philanthropist has been falsely accused of wanting to destroy the United States, of busing people into areas to create chaos and riot, and of being the driving force behind antifa and Black Lives Matter. In general, a section of the population believes that Soros is a ""puppet master"" who is secretly controlling various world events. The above-displayed meme plays into this idea by claiming that Soros' son Alexander is controlling the decisions of the Democratic party.   
The above-displayed image was posted by Soros, the deputy chair of the Open Society Foundations, on Aug. 11, 2020, along with a message congratulating Harris on her selection as Biden's 2020 running mate:
Soros's post made no mention of a ""vetting interview,"" nor did it include the alleged quote. We also found no news articles, press releases, or interviews with Soros in which he uttered this quote or talked about this supposed meeting. In fact, news articles from outlets such as USA Today and The Associated Press about the ""grueling vetting process"" that took place before Harris' nomination, made no mention of Soros at all. 
While Soros shared this image on Aug. 11, this photograph was not taken on that day. This image was actually taken -- and originally posted -- by Soros more than a year earlier, in March 2019. At the time, Harris was still exploring a run for president of the United States and was not being considered by Biden (who had not yet been selected as the Democratic party's nominee) as a vice presidential candidate. In other words, the claim made in this meme is completely bogus. 
So, where did this claim come from?
An Aug. 12, 2020, a number of social media accounts on Twitter and Facebook started to copy and paste the aforementioned text. While we are not entirely sure where the message originated, one user put in plenty of effort to try to get this false rumor to spread. Garth Limburg posted this message at least a dozen times in response to messages posted by news outlets, Biden and Harris, and a number of conservative figures such as Charlie Kirk, Dinesh D'souza, the Trump campaign, Bill Mitchell, and Seb Gorka. 
While it doesn't appear that Limburg was successful in getting a retweet from any major social media account, near-verbatim copies of this message were picked up and shared uncritically by a number of smaller accounts. 
Of course, there's no evidence that Alexander Soros ever said this, nor is there any evidence that Soros had a hand in picking Harris as Biden's running mate. This quote was entirely fabricated to further a conspiracy theory about George Soros (and now his son) controlling politics.

235.SaysKellyLoefflerwelcomedthesupportofaQAnonconspiracytheoristandshesatdownwithawhitesupremacistforaninterview,"
In a Georgia debate that could help decide which party controls the Senate, Black pastor Raphael Warnock went after white businesswoman Kelly Loeffler on race. 
""And she says she is against racism and that racism has no place,"" Warnock, the Democratic challenger, said of Loeffler, the GOP senator. 
""But she welcomed the support of a QAnon conspiracy theorist, and she sat down with a white supremacist for an interview. I don't think she can explain that.""
Warnock was referring to Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene, a supporter of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory, and conservative activist Jack Posobiec, who once interviewed Loeffler.
Warnock, pastor of the Atlanta church once led by Martin Luther King Jr., has repeatedly made the claim against Loeffler. 
In the debate, Loeffler didn't respond directly to the two-part attack, but said: ""There's not a racist bone in my body.""
Loeffler did embrace an endorsement from Greene in a campaign event, so that part is true. The evidence Warnock relies on for the other part of the claim doesn't flatly label Posobiec as a white supremacist, but notes that he has ties to people in that movement, and Posobiec and has praised some of them. 
Accepted endorsement from QAnon supporter
The QAnon conspiracy theory claims public figures like Hillary Clinton, Tom Hanks and Oprah Winfrey are part of a ring of Satan-worshipping, cannibalistic pedophiles, and that President Donald Trump is secretly fighting to bring it down. 
The FBI has described the QAnon movement as a potential domestic terrorism threat. But Greene, a former construction executive heading to Congress, has called it ""a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles out,"" and has made derogatory remarks about Black people, Jews and Muslims.
Loeffler appeared with Greene at an Oct. 15 campaign event to tout her endorsement from the House candidate. By then, Greene had won a primary runoff to represent Georgia's safely Republican 14th congressional district. 
Loeffler praised Greene's defense of ""conservative values.""
""I've gotten a lot of work done in Washington already in that regard -- and I'm thrilled to know I've got a strong, conservative champion that's going to be fighting right alongside with me,"" Loeffler said of Greene.
In the Nov. 3 election, Greene won easily, becoming the first open supporter of QAnon to win a seat in the U.S. House.

Marjorie Taylor Greene


stated on July 5, 2022 in a tweet








Says an image shows the Highland Park shooting suspect ""in jail or rehab or a psychiatric center"" before the shooting.












By Bill McCarthy * July 5, 2022







Gave interview to figure with supremacist ties
Loeffler gave an interview July 31 to Posobiec, who is known as a conservative activist and is a correspondent for One America News Network, a conservative cable news channel. 
Loeffler highlighted the interview, which aired on OANN, on her campaign's Twitter account. She said she did the interview ""to discuss why I had to call out"" the Black Lives Matter ""political organization -- and why the woke mob is trying to cancel me.""
To back its claim about Loeffler sitting for an interview ""with a white supremacist,"" Warnock's campaign cited a news report about Posobiec from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and a report about Posobiec from the Southern Poverty Law Center, a social justice nonprofit that in recent years has been criticized over some of its tracking of hate groups. Those reports talk about Posobiec's association with white supremacy.
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution led its article about the Loeffler interview by saying Posobiec is ""associated with white supremacy and Nazism."" The article said Jewish groups and media observers pointed out that Posobiec ""promotes conspiracy theories and once associated with white supremacists including Richard Spencer.""
Posobiec has praised Spencer, a white nationalist who was one of the leaders of the August 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, where a white supremacist rammed a car into a counterprotester, killing her.
The Southern Poverty Law Center, in a report published July 8 on its Hatewatch blog, said Posobiec ""collaborated for years with white supremacists,"" including Spencer. ""Posobiec's ties to far-right extremists travel beyond borders into Europe. His connections to white supremacy are too numerous to compile into one article, so Hatewatch is running a series of stories on the correspondent's ties to the movement and promotion of it.""
The center does not include Posobiec on its list of white nationalists, or its broader list of extremists.
""The only reason we have not formally listed Posobiec yet is that we are still reporting out his history within hate movements,"" Michael Edison Hayden, who wrote the Hatewatch blog post on Posobiec, told PolitiFact. ""We have more to publish about Posobiec soon, also related to promotion of an anti-immigrant politician and his collaboration with white supremacists. Do not interpret the current absence of his extremist profile as a suggestion that he is somehow less extreme than figures like Richard Spencer.""
Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, said Posobiec ""has apparently cozied up to various white supremacists."" Loeffler ""should know that granting an interview to such a person, while criticizing those who point out his bigotry and disturbing associations, legitimizes the toxic views he so dutifully promotes.""
Loeffler's campaign and Posobiec did not respond to our requests for comment.
Our ruling
Warnock said Loeffler ""welcomed the support of a QAnon conspiracy theorist, and she sat down with a white supremacist for an interview.""
Loeffler did welcome the endorsement of her campaign by a QAnon supporter.
Loeffler gave an interview to a man who has praised a prominent white nationalist and who, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, ""collaborated for years with white supremacists."" The center does not include the interviewer on its list of white nationalists, but says it is continuing to investigate him.
We rate Warnock's statement Half True.

Climate scientists and fire experts are saying climate change played a role in the severity of the wildfire crisis now afflicting parts of Australia, an assertion that hasn't gone down well with global warming deniers.
The conspiracy theory website Infowars published an article pooh-poohing any climate change connection and blaming the conflagration instead on a wave of arson across Australia. The website went so far as to claim that nearly 200 people were arrested for ""deliberately starting bushfires,"" a statistic that doesn't match information put out by the regional police.

75.DidIlhanOmarHoldSecr,"
On 22 March 2019, the Washington Free Beacon website accused U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota) of ""holding a series of secret fundraisers with groups that have been tied to the support of terrorism, appearances that have been closed to the press and hidden from public view.""
Although it's true that Omar in February and March of 2019 attended two fundraising events that were not open to the news media (one for charity and one for her reelection campaign), the events were not secret, nor were they hosted by groups ""tied to terror."" Furthermore, a third event in which she spoke in front of a large crowd in Los Angeles on 23 March 2019 could hardly be mistaken for a ""secret"" one, as it was livestreamed by Fox News. Those facts didn't stop an echo chamber of websites from reproducing similar headlines insinuating that a U.S. congresswoman was sneaking around holding furtive meetings with global terror-linked organizations.
Omar is one of the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress. An immigrant from Somalia, she is also the only member of Congress to don a hijab, the head covering worn by observant Muslim women. She has been the target of a slew of hoaxes and conspiracy theories, including unfounded claims she married her brother to game the U.S. immigration system, and false claims she made incendiary comments about white men. This fundraiser rumor is also not the first instance in which she has been falsely linked to terrorism.
Free Beacon reported that, ""Omar recently spoke in Florida at a private event hosted by Islamic Relief, a charity organization long said to have deep ties to groups that advocate terrorism against Israel. Over the weekend, she will appear at another private event in California that is hosted by CAIR-CA PAC, a political action committee affiliated with the Council on American Islamic Relations, or CAIR a group that was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in a massive terror-funding incident.""
Those two sentences contained numerous falsehoods. For starters, Free Beacon conflated different organizations with similar names and relied on unreliable accusations or incomplete context to support their ""terror ties"" claim. 






The event in Florida was hosted by Islamic Relief USA (IRUSA). Although IRUSA licenses the ""Islamic Relief"" name from the global umbrella organization Islamic Relief Worldwide (IRW), it is distinct from IRW. IRUSA is a Virginia-based, non-profit that operates in 40 countries to provide disaster relief and to fight societal ills such as poverty, hunger, and inequality. It is also one of the organizations that has participated in the U.S. government's Combined Federal Campaign, one of many charities that federal employees can select to donate to directly from their paychecks.
It was clear that Free Beacon conflated these two organizations, reporting that ""Islamic Relief has come under congressional investigation for what lawmakers have described as its efforts to provide assistance to terrorist group such as Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood. The charity has been banned by some countries as a result of these ties. In 2017, Congress sought to ban taxpayer funds from reaching the charity due to these terror links.""
All the references linked to by Free Beacon are about IRW and not IRUSA, even though Omar spoke at IRUSA's 23 February 2019 benefit dinner to help raise money for famine victims in Yemen. It's unclear how the IRUSA event attended by Omar could be construed as ""secret,"" because although it was not open to the news media, the Eventbite page advertising the event noted that members of the public could RSVP to attend for as little as $15.
And although it's true that then-U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Florida) had pushed for an amendment to a spending bill that would have eliminated State Department funding for IRW, it died when DeSantis was not present to offer the amendment for a vote, citing the looming threat of Hurricane Irma. Opponents of the bill, including then-U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minnesota), argued the amendment was motivated by Islamophobia, noting that IRW had broad support from reputable relief organizations and a track record of working alongside various United Nations agencies and European governments.
United Kingdom-based IRW was banned from operating in the United Arab Emirates and Israel over terror accusations by the governments of those countries, which the charity forcefully denied. (The British newspaper The Telegraph termed the charges ""ludicrous and defamatory."") Furthermore, the U.S. government does not designate the Muslim Brotherhood, which is an international religious and political movement, as a terrorist organization.
Free Beacon demonstrated a similar problem conflating the prominent civil rights, non-profit organization Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) with a separate political action committee, CAIR California PAC (CAIR PAC CA).
On 24 March 2019, Omar spoke to an audience at a banquet hosted by CAIR's Los Angeles chapter. The event was attended by an estimated 1,000 protesters, who demonstrated outside the Hilton Woodland Hills venue as Omar spoke. The event garnered widespread coverage from news media.
CAIR-Los Angeles Executive Director Hussam Ayloush expressed frustration about the characterization of the organization's activities as ""secret"" or ""terror""-related, telling us that they were unfair. ""For Islamophobes, anything that Muslims do is nefarious somehow. When Muslims don't engage [in American politics and discourse] they say, 'Oh what's wrong with them, they're not integrating. They must have secret plans.' And when we are engaging they ask, 'Why are they engaging, they must have secret plans.'"" 






The day following the Woodland Hills event, Omar spoke at a privately hosted political fundraiser in Irvine, California, to benefit her reelection campaign. That event was sponsored by CAIR PAC CA, a political action committee that supports candidates of its choosing. According to fliers advertising the fundraiser, the event was billed as a ""meet and greet"" with Omar. The public could RSVP to attend by donating anywhere from $50 to $250, upon which the address of the venue would be provided.
Citing death threats directed at Omar and the recent suspected hate crime vandalism of an Escondido, California, mosque, CAIR PAC CA President Joe Salas told us the event's address was kept discreet out of fear for the congresswoman's safety. But the event itself wasn't ""secret,"" he said, and about 400 to 500 people attended.
""We will open our events to the public when President Trump opens his [events] down at Mar-a-Lago,"" Salas joked, referencing similarly discreet campaign fundraising events that have benefited President Donald Trump.
Accusations that CAIR has links to terrorism are long-standing, as are CAIR's rebuttals that the effort to paint them as such stems from anti-Muslim bigotry. The New York Times documented in 2007 that:
Broadly summarized, critics accuse CAIR of pursuing an extreme Islamist political agenda and say at least five figures with ties to the group or its leadership have either been convicted or deported for links to terrorist groups. They include Mousa Abu Marzook, a Hamas leader deported in 1997 after the United States failed to produce any evidence directly linking him to any attacks.
There were no charges linked to CAIR in any of the cases involved, and law enforcement officials said that in the current climate, any hint of suspicious behavior would have resulted in a racketeering charge.
The Times also quoted retired FBI counter-terrorism agent Michael Rolince as stating, ""Of all the groups, there is probably more suspicion about CAIR, but when you ask people for cold hard facts, you get blank stares.""
Documenting a similar controversy in 2006 in which CAIR was accused of having terror links, the Associated Press reported:
In a fundraising letter, state GOP Chairman Ron Carey said [Keith] Ellison has received ""financial support from a self-identified supporter of Hamas.""
That was a reference to [CAIR founder Nihad] Awad's 1994 statement that he preferred Hamas to the Palestinian Liberation Organization. In an interview, Awad said that was before the group engaged in suicide bombings and was designated a terrorist organization by the State Department.
""I don't support Hamas today,"" Awad said. ""My position and CAIR's position is extremely clear -- we condemn suicide bombings. We are mainstream American Muslims."" 






The claim that CAIR was an ""un-indicted co-conspirator"" in a terror plot is incomplete and not new. The Washington Post analyzed it in 2011, reporting:
These claims lack context. CAIR is an aggressive Muslim civil liberties organization, modeled on the Anti Defamation League, that has made it a target for criticism. It was indeed named as an ""unindicted co-conspirator or joint venturer"" in the Holy Land Foundation case -- an Islamic charity that in 2008 was convicted of funding Islamic militant groups. But CAIR was not alone in that designation; nearly 250 other organizations and individuals were also named.
The federal government said the organizations were included on the list in order to produce evidence at the trial, but the district court and a federal appeals court later ruled that it had been a mistake to make the list public.
As the appeals court summed up last year, ""The court held that the Government did not argue or establish any legitimate government interest that warranted publicly identifying [one of the organizations] and 245 other individuals and entities as unindicted co-conspirators or joint venturers, and that the Government had less injurious means than those employed, such as anonymously designating the unindicted co-conspirators as 'other persons,' asking the court to file the document under seal, or disclosing the information to the defendants pursuant to a protective order.""
However, federal Judge Jorge A. Solis denied CAIR's request that its name be publicly stricken from the list. He said that the government ""has produced ample evidence"" to establish the association of CAIR and other organizations with entities such as the Holy Land Foundation, the Islamic Association for Palestine and with the Hamas militant group. Solis acknowledged CAIR's claim that evidence produced by the government ""largely predates"" the official designation of these groups as terror organizations but he said the ""evidence is nonetheless sufficient to show the association of these entities with HLF, IAP, and Hamas.""
Free Beacon reported that ""Omar's appearance at these closed-door forums is raising eyebrows in the pro-Israel world due to her repeated and unapologetic public use of anti-Semitic stereotypes accusing Jewish people of controlling foreign policy and politics. With Omar's popularity skyrocketing on the anti-Israel left, it appears her rhetoric is translating into fundraising prowess.""
Estee Chandler, founder of the Los Angeles chapter of the progressive organization Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), dismissed claims that Omar's commentary represents anti-Semitic views. Chandler, who supports Omar and maintains her comments were directed at state policy and not the Jewish people, accepted an award on behalf of JVP's work at the Irvine event at which Omar spoke.
""My rebuttal is that when they announced we were getting this award, Jewish Voice for Peace got a fairly long standing ovation from this room of supposed anti-Semites,"" she told us. ""It defies logic that anyone could characterize that room as anti-Semitic.""
Salas said that Omar's talk at the PAC event in Irvine wasn't recorded, but that it didn't contain any anti-Semitic remarks. Instead, he said, most of the crowd was composed of young activists who asked Omar a lot of biographical questions about her road to Congress. Also in attendance were members of San Diego, California's, Somali population and some members of the Jewish community, he said.
We reached out to Free Beacon with emailed questions about their story but the publication declined to answer them.

101.Whatweknowabout2020e,"
Four years ago, Russian operatives used a series of ""active measures"" to hack campaigns, spread disinformation and sow discord in an effort to sway the election in favor of President Donald Trump. That's according to a bipartisan Senate report and former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.
As Nov. 3 approaches, one question is on most everyone's mind: Is Russia at it again?
PolitiFact consulted experts, news reports, and publicly available intelligence from the federal government and social media platforms to get a sense of how foreign actors are trying to interfere in 2020. The consensus: It's not just Russia -- and the bigger threat is much closer to home.
""From my perspective, the vast majority of false content that's election-related is still coming from Americans themselves,"" said Cindy Otis, a former CIA officer and a disinformation and cybersecurity expert.

Intelligence community sounds alarm on foreign interference
On Sept. 17, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned that Russia was again trying to interfere in an American election.
""We certainly have seen very active efforts by the Russians to influence our election in 2020 through what I would call more the maligned foreign influence side of things: social media, use of proxies, state media, online journals, etc.,"" Wray said during a House committee hearing.

In the lead-up to the 2016 election, the Internet Research Agency, a Kremlin-linked ""troll farm,"" carried out a social media campaign ""designed to provoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States,"" according to the Mueller report. It created fake social media accounts, fabricated protests in the U.S. and published false news stories on the internet.
That kind of meddling never really stopped. In 2020, Wray said he is most concerned about the ""steady drumbeat of misinformation"" that's aimed at making Americans doubt the integrity of their votes. Other targets of misinformation are former Vice President Joe Biden and what Wray called the ""anti-Russian establishment.""
On Sept. 10, the Treasury Department announced new sanctions against four ""Russia-linked election interference actors."" One of them was Andrii Derkach, a pro-Russia Ukrainian parliamentarian who the agency said had been part of ""foreign interference in an attempt to undermine the upcoming 2020 U.S. presidential election.""
Derkach, whom the agency classified as ""an active Russian agent for over a decade,"" promoted discredited corruption allegations about Biden. Politico reported that Derkach distributed packets of anti-Biden information to Republican lawmakers investigating the former vice president for his dealings in Ukraine.
Wray's comments and the Treasury Department's sanctions are the latest indications that foreign governments appear to be meddling in the 2020 presidential contest -- but it's not just Russia.
Officials are also concerned about China and Iran. In an Aug. 7 statement, William Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, said the agency was primarily concerned about ""ongoing and potential activity by China, Russia, and Iran.""
""Many foreign actors have a preference for who wins the election, which they express through a range of overt and private statements; covert influence efforts are rarer,"" Evanina said.

In this June 29, 2019, file photo, U.S. President Donald Trump, left, shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a meeting on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Osaka, western Japan. (AP)
According to unclassified intelligence, China and Iran prefer that Trump is not re-elected, while Russia is using a range of tactics to denigrate Biden, whom the state views as anti-Russian. While Russia and China appear to be relying primarily on public rhetoric and pressure on political figures, Iran's efforts ""probably will focus on online influence, such as spreading disinformation on social media and recirculating anti-U.S. content,"" Evanina said.
To what extent have those warnings come to fruition so far? It's tough to say.
""We've looked at 35 allegations of foreign interference in 2020 so far,"" said Emerson Brooking, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. ""There is a lot of noise around these activities, but public evidence is relatively scarce.""
Tech companies find some evidence of meddling
Silicon Valley has reported a drip, drip, drip of election meddling.
Microsoft on Sept. 10 said it had detected unsuccessful cyberattacks on people and groups associated with the 2020 presidential candidates.
""The activity we are announcing today makes clear that foreign activity groups have stepped up their efforts targeting the 2020 election as had been anticipated, and is consistent with what the U.S. government and others have reported,"" the company wrote.
Cyberattacks were one of the primary ways that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. In June 2016, the Democratic National Committee announced that Russian hackers had compromised its computer servers. According to the Mueller report, the hackers, who were part of the Russian intelligence service, then leaked compromising information about Hillary Clinton over the next few months in an effort to delegitimize her candidacy for president.




The Mueller Report (PDF)

The Mueller Report (Text)

The same hackers were behind some of the cyberattacks identified by Microsoft.
In its assessment -- which is far more detailed than anything provided by U.S. intelligence agencies -- the company wrote that ""activity groups"" in Russia, China and Iran targeted organizations, advocacy groups and people associated with both the Trump and Biden campaigns. The same Russian group was identified in the Mueller report as the primary organization responsible for the DNC hacks in 2016.
""The majority of these attacks were detected and stopped by security tools built into our products,"" Microsoft said.
That doesn't mean it couldn't happen again.
""What I'm afraid of is more hacking,"" said Darren Linvill, an associate professor and state-sponsored disinformation expert at Clemson University. ""I'm very much afraid of that sort of activity moving into October.""
Meanwhile, other technology companies have focused their efforts on identifying and removing disinformation networks.
Running off of a tip from the FBI, Facebook said Sept. 1 that it removed a small network of pages and accounts created by Russian operatives who had lured journalists into writing articles critical of Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. The articles appeared on a fake, left-leaning news website called Peace Data. The apparent goal was to undermine support for the Democratic candidate among liberal voters, according to a report from Grapika, a social media research firm that works with Facebook to identify disinformation campaigns.

This March 4, 2020, image shows a collection of Instagram posts, which Facebook, the owner of Instagram, yanked off the site in October after concluding that they originated from Russia and had links to the Internet Research Agency. (AP)
On Sept. 22, Facebook announced another network takedown. This time, the network originated in China and involved hundreds of accounts, pages, groups and Instagram accounts. Some posted content ""both in support of and against presidential candidates Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden and Donald Trump,"" but the network focused on the U.S. the least and had almost no following, according to Facebook.
Some see those takedowns -- among more than 100 that Facebook has made since 2017 -- as wins for the company. Others chalk them up to drops in the ocean of potential election disinformation on the platform.
""(Peace Data) only accounted for a few thousand Facebook likes over the course of the campaign,"" Brooking said. ""Something we're always on guard against is putting so much emphasis on foreign interference. You miss the bigger picture.""
Not all interference is foreign
Teenagers posted things like ""Don't trust Dr. Fauci"" and mail-in ballots ""will lead to fraud for this election"" on their social media feeds. They appeared to be real posts from Trump supporters. 
But the Washington Post reported that the accounts were part of a disinformation network that bore a striking resemblance to how Russian agents interfered in 2016. This time, the accounts were run by Americans.
Turning Point Action, an affiliate of Turning Point USA, a conservative group with a history of spreading false and misleading information, ran the trolling operation. It paid teens to publish thousands of identical or similar social media posts targeting Democratic politicians and news organizations.
After the Post exposed the network, Facebook and Twitter removed several accounts associated with it.

In 2020, most election-related disinformation appears to be made in the USA.
""As we've conducted our enforcement actions over the past several years at Facebook, about half of these operations we see using these deceptive tactics are domestic in nature,"" said David Agranovich, Facebook's global threat disruption lead, during a July event organized by the Brookings Institution. ""We're seeing that trend increase as time goes on.""
Back in July, Facebook said it had removed nine networks of accounts, pages and groups, including some in the U.S. More than half of those networks focused on domestic audiences.
One network of Facebook accounts, pages and Instagram accounts was attributed to Republican political consultant and Trump associate Roger Stone. An earlier network, which Facebook removed in May, was run by a cluster of users who promoted the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory.
Social media companies tend to have more aggressive policies against foreign meddling.
""For social media platforms, it's a much harder thing for them to tackle American-generated disinformation or false information, even coordinated efforts like that,"" Otis said of the Turning Point Action network. ""They can claim that it's a personal political opinion.""
An abundance of domestic disinformation about things like COVID-19 and the Black Lives Matter protests also provides fodder for foreign interference operations.
RELATED: A voters' guide to combating misinformation ahead of the election and beyond
""If you see these conspiracy theories, it's kind of a no-brainer to amplify that instead of writing your own conspiracy theory,"" Brooking said.
Some inspiration comes from President Donald Trump.
Trump has repeatedly made false or misleading statements about the integrity of mail-in ballots, which more voters are expected to use this year as the coronavirus continues to rage. Trump -- whose campaign has not taken a pledge against using disinformation -- has repeatedly shared manipulated videos. And he has cast doubt on the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia interfered in 2016.
""He has every incentive to shape the public perception of the foreign meddling in a way that's to his advantage, in a way that I think could amplify the effects even more,"" said Jessica Weeks, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
What's next?
Bad actors have adapted since the last election. Some have started using proxy sites and social media profiles to spread disinformation without being caught, while others have focused their efforts on information laundering.
""We've seen an evolution in the sophistication of methods in 2020 from 2016,"" Brooking said. ""That's because the content moderation policies of the platforms have gotten much better in the interceding four years.""
Over the past four years, social media companies have spent billions of dollars hiring staff, fortifying their defenses and developing new policies to prevent 2016-style interference. They've started to release consistent public reports about disinformation campaigns. (Disclosure: PolitiFact partners with Facebook to flag and reduce the spread of misinformation on its News Feed. Read more about that partnership here.)
Still, there's some doubt as to whether tech platforms' public statements paint a complete picture of what's going on behind the scenes.
""While those reports are certainly useful and they're very well done, they aren't the full story -- and they're only what Facebook wants to release,"" Linvill said of reports like the Peace Data takedown. ""I'm sure there's all kinds of things that Facebook doesn't release.""
Given the uncertainty, voters should be on the lookout for disinformation in the weeks leading up to Election Day. Otis said most disinformation tries to appeal to people's emotions, so the most important thing you can do before sharing something is to pause and do a quick investigation. If you can't verify a claim you see on social media, the best thing to do is avoid sharing it.
The effect of election interference can be tough to measure, but it could have an adverse impact on the vote.
""The victim of all this isn't one political party or another -- it's American voters and their influence on the democratic process,"" said Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation fellow at the Wilson Center.

01.DidChicagoMayorLoriL,"
On May 19, 2021, during a segment on his Fox News show ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" host Tucker Carlson compared Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot to the Nazis.
""If some day the Chicago police round up the entire population of the city, Lori Lightfoot would have no trouble pulling the right ones out of line for punishment,"" Carlson stated. ""By the way in case you're wondering, yes, that was a Nazi reference. It was deserved. Lori Lightfoot is a monster.""
How did Lightfoot, Chicago's first female, Black, and openly gay mayor get compared to the Nazis by Carlson, a media figure who has been criticized for promoting racist conspiracy theories on his program?
Carlson's comments represented hyperbolic outrage over a decision made by Lightfoot to only do one-on-one interviews with journalists of color for one day, a symbolic gesture to highlight the lack of diversity in newsrooms.
On May 19, 2021, Lightfoot issued a letter to the Chicago press stating that as mayor, she hoped to break up the status quo ""that has failed so many residents across our city."" But, she noted, that status quo exists not just at City Hall but in public and private institutions. 






That includes, Lightfoot's letter stated, the news media that cover Chicago City Hall. Lightfoot's letter said that since her 2019 inauguration, the country has ""faced an historic reckoning around systemic racism,"" a reference to the massive racial-justice demonstrations in the spring and summer of 2020 sparked by high-profile killings of Black people, including the murder of George Floyd.
""I have been struck since my first day on the campaign trail back in 2018 by the overwhelming whiteness and maleness of Chicago media outlets, editorial boards, the political press corps, and yes, the City Hall press corps specifically,"" she wrote, later adding that the news media have failed to evolve with the norms and needs of the times. ""Diversity matters and without it, how can you as the media truly speak to the needs and interests of the diverse and nuanced constituency you claim to serve until you do the work necessary to reflect that constituency.""
Lightfoot's decision earned wide backlash from right-wing media and social media personalities. ""Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot to Grant Interviews Only to Black, Brown Journalists,"" Breitbart's headline reported, for example.
In response to Lightfoot's move, the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) released a statement that said, while it couldn't support the decision to exclude journalists from interviews on the basis of race, the decision does highlight the fact that ""Black and Brown journalists have been quietly excluded from a number of access points over the years."" The statement further read:
While the mayor has every right to decide how her press efforts will be handled on her anniversary, we must state again, for the record, that NABJ's history of advocacy does not support excluding any bona fide journalists from one-on-one interviews with newsmakers, even if it is for one day and in support of activism. We have members from all races and backgrounds and diversity, equity and inclusion must be universal. However, the mayor is right in pointing to the fact that Black and Brown journalists have been quietly excluded from a number of access points over the years. We know first hand it is painful and unhealthy for our communities.
NABJ is also gravely concerned to see that a city with such a diverse population has no fair representation of communities of color in its local press corps.
This local issue is reflective of what is happening around the country and we continue to work to change the status quo. We have been successful in a number of areas to dramatically improve access and promotions for Black journalists, especially during the awakening and racial reckoning stemming from George Floyd's death.
A lack of newsroom diversity isn't a new issue by any means. A 2018 analysis by Pew Research Center noted that newsrooms are less diverse than the overall U.S. workforce. Pew reported that, ""More than three-quarters (77%) of newsroom employees - those who work as reporters, editors, photographers and videographers in the newspaper, broadcasting and internet publishing industries - are non-Hispanic white.""

180.AlookatKamalaHarrisr,"
U.S. Senator Kamala Harris made it official this week: She's running for president in 2020. That caused many who aren't familiar with the former prosecutor, and daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, to search for information on the senator's background and positions on key issues.
Harris, a California Democrat and former state attorney general, is no stranger to PolitiFact and PolitiFact California. Together, we've fact-checked her more than a dozen times, placed Truth-O-Meter ratings on 10 of her past statements and published a profile of her this week. 
We've also investigated claims made about her, including one in July on the official White House Twitter account and more recently one by Jacob Wohl, described by media outlets as a ""far-right conspiracy theorist.""
Additionally, we examined Harris' exchange with U.S. Attorney General nominee William Barr in early January on whether President Trump's proposed border wall would reduce drug smuggling.
As of late January, Harris had earned one False rating, two Half True ratings, five Mostly True scores and two True ratings.
Below is a look at some of the prominent fact checks and articles we've produced on or about Harris:
Recent Pants On Fire claim
PolitiFact National on Tuesday rated Pants On Fire a baseless claim by Wohl saying Harris was not eligible to run for president, after the charge gained attention on Twitter. Wohl said because Harris ""was raised in Canada,"" and her parents had not been legal residents prior to Harris' birth, she couldn't legally run. In reality, Harris was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, where she lived until she moved to Montreal at age 12 after her mother took a research position at a hospital there.  
Constitutional scholars knocked down the claim, telling PolitiFact the only factor that matters is that Harris was born in the United States, in Oakland, Calif.  The 14th Amendment, an 1898 Supreme Court decision and a 1952 statute make clear that anyone born in the United States is qualified to run for president.
""This type of stuff was garbage in 2008 and it's garbage now,"" Harris' communications director, Lily Adams, wrote on Twitter in response to Wohl's claim.
Conspiracy theories in 2008, stoked by then citizen-Donald Trump, falsely alleged Barack Obama was born in Kenya and not eligible to run for president. Trump's claims carried on well into his own presidential campaign, until he withdrew it in 2016.
Harris' False claim about Brett Kavanaugh 
Last September, PolitiFact gave Harris a False rating for a claim she made about Judge Brett Kavanaugh's reference to popular contraceptive methods as ""abortion-inducing,"" during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing.
Harris tweeted a clip in which Kavanaugh said, ""Filling out the form would make them complicit in the provision of the abortion-inducing drugs that they were -- as a religious matter, objected to.""
In Harris' tweet, Kavanaugh appears to define contraception as abortion-inducing. But the video failed to include a crucial qualifier: ""They said."" In fact, PolitiFact found, he was citing the definition of the religious group Priests for Life. He has not expressed his personal view.
Pants on Fire for White House claim Harris 'supporting MS-13' 
President Trump received our most severe rating last July when the official White House Twitter account claimed Harris was ""supporting the animals of MS-13."" Harris and other Democrats have sharply criticized the Trump administration for its immigration policies. They have expressed concern about how those entering the country, legally and illegally, are treated and called for reforming or replacing ICE. That's not the same thing as or even close to ""supporting"" a violent criminal gang. PolitiFact California gave this claim a Pants On Fire.
Harris' cherry-picked claim on cost of Trump's wall
Back in August 2017, Harris claimed Trump's wall along the U.S.-Mexico border could cost ""$70 billion."" We didn't place a rating on the claim because the project's estimated cost has varied widely and remains unknown. But we found Harris selected the highest price tag, based on a report that projects the wall could be hundreds of miles longer than others see as necessary. Other estimates, including from Trump's Homeland Security Department, have placed the total at closer to $20 billion while a research firm projected the price at between $15 billion and $25 billion. Harris' statement would have benefitted from a more complete view of the facts.
Harris's True claim it costs $75K per year to lock up an inmate in California 
Also in August 2017, Harris correctly claimed ""it costs us about $33,000 a year (nationally) to lock somebody up. In California it costs about $75,000 a year.""
We gave this statement a True rating after inspecting data from California's departments of corrections and finance that support her claim.  
Digging deeper, we found reducing inmates in California's prisons, which Harris supports, may actually increase the per capita costs she highlights, especially as prison employee labor costs continue to rise.
Harris' Half True claim on Mitt Romney
PolitiFact first fact-checked Harris in her September 2012 speech at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte. It rated Half True her statement that Mitt Romney, who at the time was the Republican presidential nominee, said he favored letting housing foreclosures ""hit the bottom"" so the market could run its course. PolitiFact found Harris had omitted some key context.
PolitiFact California will continue to fact-check Harris' statements, as well as claims aimed at her, during her run for president. Suggest a fact-check at [email protected] or Twitter or Facebook.

96.WhatPresidentTrumpne,"
President Donald Trump says he doesn't know anything about a conspiracy theory that claims he's on a mission to secretly fight a cabal of left-leaning, Satan-worshipping, cannibalistic pedophiles.
""I know nothing about QAnon,"" Trump said during an NBC News town hall in Miami on Oct. 15. ""I do know they are very much against pedophilia. They fight it very hard. But I know nothing about it.""
Trump's professed ignorance of QAnon may seem familiar. 
On Aug. 14, he didn't answer a reporter's question about whether he supports QAnon. Five days later, he said he wasn't well-versed in the conspiracy theory.
""Well I don't know much about the movement other than I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate,"" he said Aug. 19.
At the same time, Trump, his family and his campaign staffers have repeatedly shared posts from QAnon-promoting accounts on social media and supported political candidates who subscribe to the conspiracy theory. On Oct. 13, the president retweeted a QAnon-supported theory that falsely claims the Obama administration killed Navy SEALs in Afghanistan.
At the NBC town hall, Trump said he knew ""nothing about it.""
""That was a retweet. That was an opinion of somebody. And that was a retweet,"" he said. ""I'll put it out there, people can decide for themselves.""
RELATED: Fact-checking Donald Trump, Joe Biden in head-to-head town halls
We can't say to what extent Trump knows about QAnon. Roughly half of Americans are at least familiar with the conspiracy theory, according to a September survey from the Pew Research Center. (We asked the White House and the president's re-election campaign if Trump has been briefed on QAnon, but we haven't heard back.)
What we can say is that QAnon is a baseless, potentially dangerous conspiracy theory -- one that Trump should know about, since the FBI has said it is a domestic terrorism threat.
This memo can bring anyone up to speed in a hurry.
There is no evidence to support QAnon's claims. This is crucial to remember as you read the tenets of the belief below.
QAnon relies on posts from an anonymous internet persona named ""Q."" The term ""QAnon"" is a mashup of ""Q"" and ""anon,"" as in ""anonymous."" The Q is a reference to a high level of security clearance at the U.S. Energy Department.
QAnon has been around since October 2017. That's when Q started posting vague and cryptic messages on a fringe internet forum called 4chan. Those posts, now hosted on 8kun -- another forum -- serve as the backbone of the conspiracy theory, whose believers trend conservative.
QAnon claims the world is run by a cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles. People targeted by the group include famous Democrats and celebrities, including Hillary Clinton and Tom Hanks. The conspiracy theory says the cabal kills and eats their victims to ingest a life-extending chemical in human blood.
QAnon says Trump is secretly fighting the underground pedophile ring. According to the conspiracy theory, top military generals convinced Trump to run for president in 2016. He's now secretly working behind the scenes to bring those involved to justice.
QAnon evolved from another baseless conspiracy theory. Pizzagate emerged during the 2016 campaign. It falsely claimed that a Washington, D.C., pizza restaurant was holding children hostage for Clinton and her allies to abuse. In December 2016, a North Carolina man drove to the restaurant to ""self-investigate"" the claims and fired an assault rifle inside. No one was injured.
QAnon blossomed on social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube. In August, NBC News reported that an internal Facebook investigation found thousands of groups and pages with millions of members and followers dedicated to QAnon. Users on YouTube and Twitter were instrumental in helping QAnon jump to a more mainstream audience.
QAnon is supported by some congressional candidates. Among them are Marjorie Taylor Greene, who won the primary election in Georgia's 14th congressional district. Republicans Jo Rae Perkins of Oregon and Lauren Boebert of Colorado have also promoted the conspiracy theory.
QAnon has spread beyond the United States. A July report from NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, noted that QAnon has taken root in the European Union.  Regional Facebook groups have swelled in numbers and tailored the conspiracy theory ""to target local politicians and elites."" 
QAnon has been linked to crime. In a May 2019 intelligence bulletin, FBI officials described ""conspiracy theory-driven domestic extremists"" -- including QAnon -- as a growing threat. A July report from the U.S. Military Academy's Combating Terrorism Center cited a number of examples of violence linked to QAnon -- including one in which a man pleaded guilty to making a terrorist threat.
QAnon is banned on several social media platforms. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and TikTok have all cracked down on content related to the conspiracy theory. In light of those actions, some QAnon supporters have rebranded the movement as #SaveOurChildren.

121.ConvictedCharlestonS,"
In December 2016, 22-year-old Dylann Roof was convicted on 33 federal hate crimes counts related to the June 2015 Charleston church shooting that left nine people dead.  The news of his conviction revived a June 2015 conspiracy theory that the Roof was not who he was claimed to be, but rather was a former child star and crisis actor named John Christian Graas.
A constellation of ""crisis actor"" rumors widely entered mainstream conspiracy theory after the Sandy Hook school shootings of 2012. Shortly after news of that earlier massacre broke, multiple persons connected to the tragedy (typically family members of dead victims) were accused of being crisis actors (i.e., professional actors supposedly engaged by government agencies and the news media to deceive the public about the reality of allegedly staged (also known as ""false flag"") events, hired to convincingly portray persons in the throes of trauma and suffering).
After Sandy Hook, iterations of the ""crisis actor"" claim were attached by online conspiracy buffs to virtually every subsequent mass shooting event, with numerous truthers attempting to ""out"" these potential ""plants"" by matching them up with images of persons who had no connection to those events.
The Charleston church massacre took place on 17 June 2015, and in less than a week conspiracy theorists were asserting that accused shooter Dylann Roof was actually John Christian Graas, a former child actor who had appeared in several films and episodes of numerous television series (and who, according to the Internet Movie Database, enlisted as a U.S. Marine in 2010).
One early version of the rumor held:
There's been tons of speculation in regards to the Charleston shooting rampage.
Was this another False Flag to distract and terrorize the masses?
What would be gained from such an event?
In this video you are about to watch, you will see hard core evidence that the shooter is really 33 year old John Christian Graas, Hollywood child actor and US Marine aviator as of 2010 and on US Marine register as of 2013.

 






The associated video clip documented only that Graas and Dylann Roof bore a passing resemblance to one another, its ""hardcore evidence"" hinging on facial similarities between Roof at the time of his 2015 arrest and Graas as a young boy in the early 1990s:

(We could find no post-childhood photographs of Graas to use in a more relevant comparison.)
Central to the conspiracy theory was Roof's ""bowl"" haircut, atypical for a man his age (21 at the time of his arrest) but common for a young boy such as Graas was during his acting career. Roof and the younger Graas both had a similar lip shape, but their noses were not similar, and while Roof appeared to have light green or blue eyes, photographs of Graas looked to depict a boy with dark hazel or brown eyes. (That latter discrepancy was typically shaded by contrasting color photographs of Graas with black-and-white images of Roof.) The shape of Grass and Roof's eyes also visibly differed.
Another glaring hole in the conspiracy involved the respective ages and histories of the two men. While Roof was 21 in the photographs used as a comparison, Graas was at least 33 when the rumors that he was acting the part of shooter ""Dylann Roof"" first circulated. Roof was not born until April 1994, when Graas was already at the height of his childhood acting career:

Graas continued to work steadily through at least 1999, around the time Roof would have been entering kindergarten, and was reported as having enlisted in the Marines in 2010. Roof's early life was thoroughly investigated after the shooting and documented an individual who had been on the grid during that period of time (not a persona that had suddenly been ""created"" around the time of the Charleston shooting).
In profiles published after the shooting, references to Roof were found in 2008 court papers (related to a parent's divorce) that appeared alongside descriptions of his school records. Childhood friends also placed Roof in the school system and attested to relationships with him years earlier:
When Roof reconnected with his childhood friend [Joey] Meek [in May 2015], something in him had changed ... they lost contact [around 2011], Meek said. When Roof contacted him, Meek said he welcomed his childhood friend into his home.
But Roof was not the same friend Meek had known from their childhood. Roof always had been quiet, Meek said, but this time he was different.
""I was trying to just treat him like he was the same friend and treat him like he was the same person,"" Meek said in an interview with The State newspaper last week. ""But people can change in that short time, and I just didn't see it"" while it was happening.
Meek was one of the first to call law enforcement June 18 [2015] after he saw the surveillance images released of Roof before his capture. 






Family members also provided accounts of Roof's early and later life to news outlets, many describing his alarmingly rapid transition from a young man with black friends to someone absorbed by white nationalist sentiments:
The people who know Dylann Storm Roof -- the people who watched his progression from a sweet child to a disturbed man -- are struggling with guilt. [T]alk to his friends and family, and a portrait emerges of a troubled and confused 21-year-old, often drunk and occasionally threatening as he alternated between partying with black friends and spouting white power slogans to white friends. Court documents and nearly two dozen interviews show Roof's early childhood was troubled and confused as well, as he grew up in an unstable, broken home amid allegations of marital abuse and infidelity.
As a 4-year-old, ""He was so sweet and bright,"" recalls Patricia Hastings, who was once his step-grandmother.
Seventeen years later, she is among many who are trying to figure out what happened to Dylann Roof ... There is little dispute his childhood was difficult ... In an affidavit filed in her 2009 divorce, [Roof's former stepmother Paige Hastings/Mann] said she became a surrogate mother to the children: ""I raised [Roof's father's] kids from a very young age, took them to all of their activities.""
[Former step-grandmother] Patricia Hastings said her daughter loved Dylann and Amber ""unconditionally as her own."" She said [biological mother] Amy Roof would leave them in Paige's care with little notice, even though Paige had her own new baby, their half-sister Morgan.
Paige cut Dylann's hair in the bowl cut he still wears; she took Amber to college orientation because ""both parents were unavailable,"" Paige's friend Leslie McArver wrote in an affidavit.
As he grew, Dylann exhibited obsessive compulsive behavior, Hastings said. He would obsess over germs, and insisted on having his hair cut in that same style, Hastings said ... After Paige filed for divorce, Franklin Roof hired a private investigator to shadow her, revealing she was having an affair, according to the court documents ... The divorce was granted in 2009. Hastings recalls that her daughter told her she felt guilty leaving Dylann.
Roof began having trouble in school. He failed the ninth grade twice, then dropped out for good in 2010.
According to Patricia Hastings, recounting [2015] conversations with her daughter, Roof was quieter than he used to be; he looked distant, lost. He was no longer the sweet blond kid she helped raise for nearly a decade. As she was getting ready to leave, Roof, not one for affection, hugged her tight.
""It was like he was saying goodbye,"" Hastings said ... The next time Mann saw him, it was on television as the man accused of the killings.
Roof's former schools and his school records and acquaintances were also examined and reported on in mid-2015:
[N]othing in the records, and nothing in his friends' memories, offer a clear explanation to the question haunting South Carolina and the nation: How did the silent young man with no record of violence in his past come to be accused of killing nine people who had gathered to pray?
""When he opened up, you could tell something was wrong at home. He wasn't at peace,"" said Taliaferro Robinson-Heyward, who attended middle school with Mr. Roof. ""It wasn't like he was a mean person, but you could tell he had a darkness to his life.""
The Lexington School District, where Mr. Roof attended fourth, eighth and ninth grades, described him as a ""very transient student.""
""I remember him as somewhat shy, and that he never penetrated into the 'in' crowd,"" said Ted Wachter, the retired principal of Rosewood Elementary School, where Mr. Roof attended fifth grade.
Mr. Robinson-Heyward, who is black, said he saw little evidence of bigotry in the young Dylann. ""To me, in the seventh grade, he saw black just as he saw white, you know,"" said Mr. Robinson-Heyward ... Another childhood friend, Caleb Brown, recalled a class assignment that required students to go home and ask about their heritage ... With a child's inquisitiveness, Mr. Roof asked his mixed-race friend, who had darker skin and curly hair, about his background and learned that Mr. Brown's father was black.
""That didn't change his behavior toward me,"" Mr. Brown said in an interview.
The boys became friends at the behest of their mothers, having sleepovers, skateboarding and playing Nascar racing video games. Mr. Brown recalled Mr. Roof's mother being welcoming and tolerant of all of races.
""He wasn't the most popular kid, but he wasn't upset about that,"" Mr. Brown said ... Several of Mr. Roof's friends said he often complained that his father put him to work landscaping. Even in his youth, Mr. Roof began to exhibit a greater interest in smoking grass than cutting it. At 13, [in approximately 2007] his mother caught him spending $50 he had earned landscaping on marijuana, Ms. Konzny said ... family turmoil took place at about the time Mr. Roof was entering ninth grade in Lexington. School records show he repeated the grade, completing the last three months of his second stint of ninth grade back in Columbia, in 2010.
Visual evidence presented to bolster the theory that Dylann Roof was child actor John Christian Graas was extremely weak, consisting largely of cherry-picked images showing Roof's child-like haircut contrasted with that of an actual child. But the details of Roof's childhood (which differ substantially from those of the much-older John Christian Graas) are far more more compelling evidence against the ""crisis actor"" theory than shaky picture comparisons are evidence for it.

Claim



			A book about Hitler quotes him as saying that he would start a third world war -- after his death.
		



Rating









False


							About this rating
						











 






Origin
In June 2017, a persistent hoax involving a falsified quote, supposedly from Nazi leader Adolf Hitler about how he would start World War III even after his death, began to recirculate in meme form: 







This passage is frequently shared in defense of Hitler to bolster the argument that he was actually not racist, and, in fact, that he believed black people were the ""true Hebrews"".  The first iteration of this text we could uncover was published on a clickbait web site called FMLGoneViral.com on 7 July 2015:

Hitler said even in his death he will start World War 3.
One of his soliders asked how?
Hitler replied, ""The day mankind finds out what I was trying to defend this nation, Germany, from then thats the day World War 3 will start.
For on that day, mankind will learn that I was trying to save my Nation from The Free Masons, the Illuminati, the jews. For if the Americans wins the war, then they will conquer the world and forever be a slave to the jews and they will try to conquer God. Do you know who America has in its posession?
""NO,"" the solider replied.
The Americans has the jewels of God. The Americans have stolen God's precious jewels.
""What do you mean his precious jewels?"" THE SOLIDER asked.
Hitler said, ""America has stolen the jews. The Jews of God. His jewelry. The negros. They are the true hebrews. What a foolish move and a direct challenge to God. And they plan on moving these false white jews into a state of Israel.
America is desperate in its attempt to win this war using atom bombs on Japan. America will destroy the whole world in its attempt to conquer it.
When America and its jewish slave masters conquer the world and the world realize I was right, then all nations will begin a third world war to dethrone America of its rule. Every nation will soon possess atom bombs of their own. It will be the end of most of the world as we know it.
""Why will the jews control America?"" the solider asked
Hitler said, ""because the white jews knows that the negros are the real children of Israel. And to keep Americas secret, the jews will blackmail America. The jews will extort America Their plan for world domination wont work if the negros knew who they were. The white citizens of America will be terrified to know that all this time they've been mistreating and discriminating and lynching the childen of Israel. They will fear God will destroy them as he destroyed Egypt for doing the same thing. So the elite, the Illuminati keeps this a secret at all cost.
After I die, I will one day cause World War 3 just by this message which will be like planting a seed in people minds until it sprouts once they nurture that seed and seek more truth and learn Hitler was right. I did the world a favor by killing the false jews before they designated a false state of Israel.
But I fear I have failed. The world will fall into the hands of Satan.

Although the clickbait site provided no citation for when Hitler allegedly made these statements, commenters on the page directed those curious about the quote's authenticity to the book The Nazis World War II by Robert Edwin Herstein.
Other dubious sites immediately picked up on this claim and uncritically re-shared the completely bogus Adolf Hitler quote along with its alleged source -- clearly without doing even the barest minimum of research, such as opening the book in which the quote supposedly appears.
Needless to say,, this passage does not appear in Herzstein's book. We could not find this passage in either the digital copy available via Google Books, nor the hard copy we examined. Page 132 of Herzstein's book The Nazis features a photograph of Hitler, Joseph Goebbels, and others watching a propaganda film, a description of what this film depicted, as well as a few stills from the production:



The page, like the rest of the book, does not contain an argument suggesting that Adolf Hitler was not racist (given his actions in the historical record, a case for his lack of prejudice would be difficult to make indeed) or that he was kind toward black people. (The hoax quote also appears to miss that racism can exist toward different ethnic groups.) Instead, it describes a propaganda film that linked Jewish people to other groups -- including black people: 

Goebbels and Hitler personally appraise a new German movie. When the Fuhrer complained that the films espousing the Nazi line were too scarce, Goebbels rushed a pair of anti-semitic pictures into production.
In one segment of a Nazi ""Instructional"" film (right), the genetic heritage of the Jew is purportedly traced to Oriental, Negro, Near Asian and Hamitic peoples. Hence, the film concludes, ""the Jew is a bastard."" Below, the villainous title character of Jud Suss, a violently anti-Semitic melodrama, spins chemes with his crony, Rabbi Loew.
MOVIES HINTING AT HORRORS TO COME
To Joseph Goebbels, films were ""one of the most modern and scientific means of influencing the masses"" Though the German film industry remained largely in private hands, every movie needed the imprimatur of the Propaganda Ministry before it reached the screen, and Goebbels became notorious for meddling with scripts, directors, and actors. In 1938, he set movie studios to work producing anti-Jewish films. 
In addition, a special team was assembled at the ministry itself to undertake a project called The Eternal Jew. The result, a virulent 45-minute harangue billed as a documentary, was shown to audiences throughout Europe. The film featured a lingering look at kosher animal slaughter, imputing sadism and bloodthirstiness to the ""Jewish race."" Jews were likened to rats and other vermin: ""They carry disease,"" warned the narration.
Such films, which depicted the Jews as a plague to be eradicated, hinted darkly at the real-life horrors to come.

The propaganda film described in this book attempted to trace Jewish ancestry to other groups of people, most likely to demonize other cultures outside of the Aryan race -- not to absolve any groups or make anti-racist arguments.
An article published by the United States Holocaust Museum explained that although black people were not targeted in the same way as Jews, they were still persecuted, and Germany produced propaganda that painted black soldiers as chronic rapists and a threat to the ""purity"" of the German race: 

The fate of black people from 1933 to 1945 in Nazi Germany and in German-occupied territories ranged from isolation to persecution, sterilization, medical experimentation, incarceration, brutality, and murder. However, there was no systematic program for their elimination as there was for Jews and other groups.
[...]
Following World War I and the Treaty of Versailles (1919), the victorious Allies occupied the Rhineland in western Germany. The use of French colonial troops, some of whom were black, in these occupation forces exacerbated anti-black racism in Germany. Racist propaganda against black soldiers depicted them as rapists of German women and carriers of venereal and other diseases. The children of black soldiers and German women were called ""Rhineland Bastards."" The Nazis, at the time a small political movement, viewed them as a threat to the purity of the Germanic race. In Mein Kampf (My Struggle), Hitler charged that ""the Jews had brought the Negroes into the Rhineland with the clear aim of ruining the hated white race by the necessarily-resulting bastardization.""

The rumor that Adolf Hitler said that World War III would begin when the United States realized that black people were the ""true Hebrews"" originated in an unsourced article published by a disreputable web site, and which appears to loosely string together an entire ecosystem of impossibly farfetched and completely unsourced conspiracy theories. Although the quote in the meme was attributed to a legitimate publication, the briefest and most cursory research shows that it appears nowhere in the book cited.

43.SpikeLeeReEditsDocum,"
Famed filmmaker Spike Lee is developing a documentary series for HBO titled ""NYC Epicenters: 9/11 -- 2021 1/2 ,"" which will begin airing at the end of August 2021. But in a statement to the media, he revealed that he was re-editing his last episode after controversy grew surrounding his inclusion of conspiracy theorists. 
After media reports revealed that the last episode featured interviews with 9/11 truthers, or conspiracy theorists, HBO announced that Lee had edited out the segments that included those interviews. 
The controversy began on Aug. 21, 2021, when early reviews of the episodes were released, and critics noticed the screen time being given to the conspiracy theorists. Many pointed out that it featured interviews with Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth, a group known for peddling conspiracy theories that the 9/11 attacks were an inside job. The group's founder, Richard Gage, has also expressed anti-Semitic views. 
In an Aug. 23, 2021, interview with The New York Times, when asked about the inclusion of these truthers, Lee said Congress should hold a congressional hearing about 9/11, saying he still had ""questions"" surrounding what happened. After the interviewer asked him if he did not buy the official explanation, he said:
The amount of heat that it takes to make steel melt, that temperature's not reached. And then the juxtaposition of the way Building 7 fell to the ground -- when you put it next to other building collapses that were demolitions, it's like you're looking at the same thing. But people going to make up their own mind. My approach is put the information in the movie and let people decide for themselves. I respect the intelligence of the audience. 






Soon after this interview, Lee released a statement through HBO saying, """"I'm Back In The Editing Room And Looking At The Eighth And Final Chapter Of 'NYC EPICENTERS 9/11 -- 2021 1/2 .' I Respectfully Ask You To Hold Your Judgement Until You See The FINAL CUT.""
The eighth chapter he is referring to is likely the fourth episode of the overall series, which covers challenges that New York City is facing in the 21st century, including interviews with eyewitnesses to the 9/11 attacks, first responders, journalists, politicians, a number of activists and artists. 
After this statement, HBO confirmed that the interviews with the 9/11 truthers were being edited out from the last episode of the series. In the newly edited version of the last episode, which was released to the media on Aug. 26, Lee cut an entire 30-minute segment featuring the interviews with conspiracy theorists. Lee also removed an interview with Ronald Hamburger, who investigated the collapse of the twin towers for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Hamburger told him that the cause of the collapse was not controlled demolitions as the conspiracy theorists claimed. 
""I did get the understanding in my discussions with him that he wanted to give them credence,"" Hamburger said, according to The New York Times. 
No reason was given by HBO or Lee for the new edit.

In the days following the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February 2022, a photograph was circulated on social media that supposedly showed the words ""pupil propaganda"" misspelled as ""pupil propoganda"":

 
This is a genuine image from CPAC.
According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, ""propaganda"" is spelled prop-A-ganda not prop-O-ganda.
""Definition of propaganda: the spreading of ideas, information, or rumor for the purpose of helping or injuring an institution, a cause, or a person""
This screenshot was taken during a livestream from CPAC that featured Candace Owens, a conservative commentator who has spread conspiratorial ideas about COVID-19 and the Jan 6. Capitol attack, and who recently said she believed the 1969 moon landing was fake.

312.IsraeldroppedatacticalnuclearweaponontheportofBeirut,"
More than 100 people were killed and thousands injured in a large explosion at the port of Beirut on Aug. 4. Lebanese officials have attributed the tragedy to the detonation of more than 2,700 tons of a chemical commonly used in fertilizer.
But some have an alternative explanation for the explosion, which could be felt up to 150 miles away.
""Israel Hits Beirut with Nuclear Missile, Trump and Lebanese Govt. Confirm,"" reads the headline on an Aug. 5 article from Veterans Today, a website with a history of publishing anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and Russian propaganda.
The article itself has not been shared much on social media, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool owned by Facebook. But screenshots of the headline, images embedded in the story and similar claims have been shared widely across social media platforms.

(Screenshots from Facebook)
Some of the posts were flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
Lebanese officials are still investigating what sparked the fire that caused the explosion, which severely damaged buildings throughout the capital and covered the city in debris. But is there any evidence that Israel was involved?
In a word: no.


Initial investigation indicates no evidence the explosion in Beirut was caused by a nuclear weapon.


Israeli officials have denied any involvement in the tragedy.


The Lebanese government and President Donald Trump have not ""confirmed"" that Israel is to blame for the destruction.


What we know about the explosion
While it's still unclear how exactly the explosion unfolded, available evidence points to a combination of fireworks and ammonium nitrate.
Lebanese authorities have said the blast occurred at a warehouse along the Beirut waterfront. The explosion is thought to have been caused by the ignition of ammonium nitrate that had been stored at the site for six years, according to Prime Minister Hassan Diab.
Ammonium nitrate is an explosive compound that's commonly used in fertilizer and bombs. It was used in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which left 168 people dead.
Officials are still investigating what started the fire at the warehouse. However, the fire appears to have spread with the help of fireworks also stored at the port.
Eyewitness video from Beirut shows what looks like fireworks igniting at the site of the fire at the port. The same footage does not show an incoming missile before the explosion.

The explosion in the videos looks like a mushroom cloud. But contrary to the Veterans Today article, there is no evidence that the explosion was caused by a nuclear weapon. 
Atomic explosions create a blinding light, searing heat and nuclear fallout -- none of which have been detected in Beirut. Meanwhile, reddish smoke, a telltale sign of ignited ammonium, can be seen in several bystander videos. The Associated Press reported the blast appeared to create a ""condensation cloud, often common in massive explosions in humid conditions that can follow the shock waves of an explosion."" 
Other fact-checkers have debunked claims that the blast was caused by a nuclear bomb. 
Israel denies involvement, Trump contradicts defense officials
So the explosion in Beirut was not caused by a nuclear weapon. But what about the alleged involvement of Israel?
Israel is still technically at war with Hezbollah, a Lebanese political party that has been designated as a terrorist group by several countries -- including the U.S. But Israeli intelligence officials have denied involvement in the Beirut explosion to several news outlets. In fact, Israel has offered humanitarian aid to Lebanon through the United Nations.
""On behalf of the government of Israel, I send my condolences to the people of Lebanon,"" tweeted the office of Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Aug. 5. ""Yesterday Lebanon suffered a major catastrophe. We are ready to offer humanitarian assistance, as human being to human beings.""
The Lebanese government, which has accused Israel of provoking a recent escalation along the border, has not blamed its neighbor for the blast.
Meanwhile, Trump said during an Aug. 4 press briefing that the Beirut explosion ""looks like a terrible attack."" When a reporter questioned his use of the word ""attack,"" the president doubled down.
""Well, it would seem like it, based on the explosion,"" Trump said. ""I've met with some of our great generals, and they just seem to feel that it was. This was not some kind of a manufacturing explosion-type of event.""
But CNN reported that Trump's comments contradicted the view of several Defense Department officials. 
In its article, Veterans Today cites ""a general in the Lebanese Army,"" someone else who writes for the website (and another site linked to pro-Russian disinformation), and an image of what appears to be a bird near the fire at the port of Beirut.
We reached out to the author of the Veterans Today article, but he did not comment.
Our ruling
Veterans Today claimed Israel dropped a nuclear weapon on the port of Beirut on Aug. 4.
There is no evidence to support that. 
Lebanese officials believe a combination of fireworks and ammonium nitrate caused the explosion in Beirut, a hypothesis that experts and eyewitness videos back up. The characteristics of a nuclear blast have not been detected in the city. And Israel has denied any involvement in the explosion.
The article is inaccurate. We rate it False.

185.NancyPelosiexplainshowDemocratsdemonizepoliticalopponentsthroughthewrapupsmear,"
Social media users are claiming that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi admitted she used smear tactics to demonize political opponents. According to these users, a YouTube video even shows her saying so in her very own words. 
The video, an excerpt from a June 22, 2017, press briefing, began circulating in 2018 after allegations of sexual assault dominated Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing. Conservative activist groups, pundits and conspiracy outlets all asserted that it showed Pelosi describing the ""smear"" tactics that Democrats had used on Kavanaugh. 
More recent posts have claimed that the clip shows Pelosi describing the tactics Democrats used to attack former President Donald Trump.
Here's why you shouldn't believe these claims: The video takes Pelosi out of context and misleadingly captions her remarks, making it seem like she's explaining a political tactic called the ""wrap-up smear"" that she and other Democrats have deployed in the past.
""It's a self-fulfilling prophecy,"" Pelosi says in the clip, which has been viewed on YouTube more than 60,000 times. ""You demonize, and then you -- we call it the wrap-up smear. You want to talk about politics? It's called the wrap-up smear. You smear somebody with falsehoods and all the rest, and then you merchandise it, and then you write it, and they'll say 'See, it's reported in the press that this, this, this and this,' so they have that validation that the press reported the smear, and then it's called a wrap-up smear. 'Now I'm going to merchandise the press's report on the smear that we made.' It's a tactic, and it's self-evident.""
The video was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
That's because the clip cuts out both the question that Pelosi was responding to and the first part of her remarks. A longer version of the video shows that Pelosi was accusing Republicans of using the ""wrap-up smear"" against Democrats running for office in the 2018 midterms. She was not laying out a blueprint of how to smear Republican opponents.

Here's a transcript of the relevant passage from Pelosi's press briefing, complete with the question she was answering when she made her ""wrap-up smear"" comment. 
Reporter: ""Is it worth it to try and I guess like rehab your image in some of these Republican districts, which would sort of present what you've done, or are you guys more focused on just-""
Pelosi: ""Well, people say to me all the time, 'you raise more money than anybody,' maybe not the Obamas and the Clintons, but I've not run for president. 'Why don't you spend some of your money on yourself? Go out there and say what you did, this, this and this.' But you know, it's just not... Maybe I should, but the fact is, what I want to do is have these members present themselves. Because basically at the end of the day that's what people are interested in -- their representative and what their representative is going to do for their district. Republicans are afraid of that contrast in a race. Because they're going to go there to be involved in trickle-down economics, shutting down hospitals, and the rest of it. So they don't want them to see that contrast, so they focus on something else. And it's a diversionary tactic. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. You demonize, and then you -- we call it the wrap-up smear. You want to talk about politics? It's called the wrap-up smear. You smear somebody with falsehoods and all the rest, and then you merchandise it, and then you write it, and they'll say ""See, it's reported in the press that this, this, and this,"" so they have that validation that the press reported the smear, and then it's called a wrap-up smear. ""Now I'm going to merchandise the press's report on the smear that we made."" It's a tactic, and it's self-evident.""
This was not the first time that Pelosi spoke disapprovingly of the ""wrap-up smear."" In a March 6, 2017, interview on CNN, Pelosi accused Trump of using ""wrap-up smears"" against former President Barack Obama. 
Our ruling
A YouTube video appears to show Pelosi describing how to demonize political opponents through a tactic called the ""wrap-up smear.""
The video takes Pelosi of context and misleadingly captions her remarks. The full transcript and clip of her comments shows that she was actually criticizing Republicans for engaging in smear tactics, not advocating that Democrats do so.

42.The5GAndBeyondActisnotaBritishlaw,"
A Facebook post from a local group for Street and Glastonbury claims that a new law was passed ""while everyone was distracted"", which will supposedly ""speed up the installation of 5G and protect profits!"" The post says that the ""SECURE 5G AND BEYOND ACT OF 2020"" was ""signed into law 116-129 on 3-23-2020"". 
In fact this is a US law, which has no power in the UK. (There is a clue in the date, which follows the American style of putting the month number before the day number.)
It is called the ""Secure 5G and Beyond Act of 2020"" and it is about ensuring the security of 5G technology in the US and globally. It requires the President to develop a strategy for making this happen. One of its stated aims is also to ""protect the competitiveness of United States companies"" working on 5G.
It's worth bearing in mind that while the Act was signed into law during the coronavirus outbreak - on 23 March - it was going through the US legislative process for nearly a year. It was first introduced into the US Senate in March 2019, and was scrutinised by lawmakers in the months that followed. 
The post goes on to make several further claims about the supposed dangers of 5G technology, which are also not true. The false rumour that 5G radio waves pose a risk to human health is a common conspiracy theory, which we have written about many times before.

The assassination of John F. Kennedy has spurred some of the most prominent and enduring conspiracy theories in the history of American politics. In addition to claims about a second shooter or a government cover-up, we have also seen photographs purporting to capture the chaotic day (but which actually show scenes from a 1970s made-for-TV movie), and an attempt to link politician Ted Cruz's father to Lee Harvey Oswald. 
But perhaps the most interesting claim about the president's assassination is that John F. Kennedy purportedly ""predicted"" his own death:

This quote comes from a biography of Kennedy that was originally published in 1972 and entitled Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye; the book was written by two of Kennedy's close friends and advisors, special assistant David Powers and political aide Kenneth O'Donnell. 
Powers and O'Donnell wrote that Kennedy made the observation to his wife Jackie after the First Lady glimpsed a full-page anti-Kennedy advertisement published in the Dallas Morning News (""Welcome Mr. Kennedy"") on the morning before his assassination:

I had in my hand a copy of the Dallas News, with its black-bordered anti-Kennedy tirade, but I hesitated to show it to the President because I was reluctant to dampen his cheerful mood. I waited while he made a telephone call to Uvalde, Texas, to talk with Jon Nance Garner; Lyndon Johnson reminded him that today was Garner's ninety-fifth birthday.
Then I handed him the newspaper. He said he had seen it, and he showed the black-bordered advertisement to Jackie. That night on the way back to Washington, she and I talked about what he said to her while she was reading the ad. ""We're heading into nut country today,"" he said. ""But Jackie, if somebody wants to shoot me from a window with a rifle, nobody can stop it, so why worry about it?""


Although this statement originated with a seemingly reliable source, it is of course possible that Powers and Powell took some creative license with its phrasing. We should also point out that while Kennedy's comment seems prescient in retrospect, the New York Times noted that multiple people had warned the president in advance of his trip to Dallas in 1963:
For those men, Kennedy was a veritable enemy of the state, which is why a group of them would commission and circulate ""Wanted for Treason"" pamphlets before the president's arrival and fund the presciently black-rimmed ""Welcome Mr. Kennedy"" advertisement that ran in The Dallas Morning News on the morning of Nov. 22. It's no surprise that four separate confidants warned the president not to come to Dallas: an incident was well within the realm of imagination.
We reached out to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum for further clarification and received the following reply:
Snopes has correctly identified that quote, which appeared in O'Donnell and Powers' Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye. It is stated in this book that the President had a fatalistic attitude about the possibility of an assassination and this attitude is often referred to anecdotally. We do not have anything else to add at this time.

As Americans continue to pay high prices at the gas pump, some have taken to social media to claim that people have been lied to about fossil fuels and the availability of oil. 
According to one TikTok video shared on Facebook, fossil fuels do not, in fact, come from the remains of long-dead organisms, and oil is one of the most abundant liquids on the planet, next to water. 
The woman in the clip claims that the term ""fossil fuel"" was coined by American businessman and Standard Oil owner John D. Rockefeller to trick the public into thinking that oil was a rarity so he could drive up the price.
""Did you know that fossil fuels do not come from long-dead living organisms?"" the woman says in the clip. ""In 1892, the owner of standard oil, who happened to be John D. Rockefeller himself, he named fossil fuels to trick people into thinking that his product was scarce, in turn allowing for an increase in prices. How much did you pay in gas today? And how do you feel knowing that you're paying that much for the second most abundant liquid on the planet?""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Rockefeller is not responsible for coining the term ""fossil fuel"" in 1892 -- it was being used well before he was born -- and fossil fuels do, in fact, come from decomposing organisms.
Oil also isn't created quickly, and while it may be abundant, experts said that doesn't mean it's all readily available.
Tyler Priest, a history and geography professor at the University of Iowa and leading expert on the history of offshore oil and gas, told PolitiFact that the claim stems from a longstanding conspiracy theory about big oil corporations going back to Rockefeller. 
The belief involves the so-called ""abiogenic oil"" theory which, he said, ""proposes that petroleum is formed by inorganic means deep in the earth's mantle, and thus is almost infinitely abundant. Somehow, the oil industry has managed to keep most people from learning about this.""
Who coined 'fossil fuel'?
John D. Rockefeller was born in 1839 and founded the Standard Oil Company in 1870, becoming one of the world's first billionaires.
While he made a lot of money off oil, he didn't coin the term ""fossil fuel"" to drive up the price. It was, instead, conceived by a German chemist named Caspar Neumann and can be found in the index of the 1759 English translation of ""The Chemical Works of Caspar Neumann.""
The term was used in other works that pre-date Rockefeller, including in the title of an 1835 book on the history of Great Britain's coal trade.
But it was used more widely in the early 1900s to give people the idea that petroleum, coal and natural gas come from ancient living things, making them a natural substance.

The Pentagon ""finally comes clean"" and ""admits...that there are 46 U.S. military-funded biolabs in Ukraine""












By Samantha Putterman * June 15, 2022







In Google Books Ngram Viewer, a tool that charts the usage of specific words or phrases in books over time, results for ""fossil fuels"" show that the term was used periodically between 1750 and 1900 and spiked after the 1940s, which was after Rockefeller's death in 1937. 
""'Fossil fuels' was not really a term anyone used to refer to oil in the late 19th century, at least in the U.S. context,"" said Priest. ""People used the terms 'oil,' 'mineral oil,' 'rock oil,' 'Seneca oil,' 'gas oil,' or 'petroleum.' I'm pretty sure (John D. Rockefeller) never invented or even used the term 'fossil fuels.'"" 
How fossil fuels work
Fossil fuels are made from decomposing plants and animals -- mainly microorganisms like phytoplankton and algae from millions of years ago. These fuels are found in the Earth's crust and contain carbon and hydrogen, which can be burned for energy. Coal, crude oil, and natural gas are examples of fossil fuels.
While water is considered the most abundant liquid on earth, we could not find an official measurement that ranks the prevalence of different types of liquids on earth.
But even if oil were somehow determined to be the second-most abundant liquid on the planet, that designation doesn't mean much, energy experts said. 
The U.S. Energy Information Administration, the federal agency responsible for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating energy information, told PolitiFact that, while it doesn't have comparisons of volumes of oil versus other liquids, just because oil exists somewhere doesn't mean it's economically or technically possible to extract it.
Experts estimate the volume of recoverable crude oil using a figure called ""proved reserves"" -- estimates of the volumes of oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate to be recoverable in future years under existing economic and operating conditions.
The amount of proved reserves fluctuates in certain circumstances.  
""In 2020 for instance, proved reserves of oil declined from 2019 levels,"" EIA spokesperson Chris Higginbotham told us in an email. ""Lower crude oil prices in 2020 caused many operators to revise their estimates of proved reserves downward and scale back development plans for new wells ... So, just because oil exists, that doesn't mean it's necessarily available.""
Oil is also not created quickly and is not considered a self-replenishing resource.
""Petroleum, like coal and natural gas, is a non-renewable source of energy,"" National Geographic says on its website. ""It took millions of years for it to form, and when it is extracted and consumed, there is no way for us to replace it.""
Our ruling
A Facebook post features a TikTok video that claims Rockefeller created the term ""fossil fuels"" in 1892 to trick people into thinking oil was scarce and boost prices when fossil fuels are actually ""the second most abundant liquid on the planet.""
Rockefeller is not responsible for coming up with the term ""fossil fuels"" at the end of the 19th century. It was being used over 100 years earlier, first showing up in 1759 in texts by the German chemist Caspar Neumann. 
Oil might be abundant but it took millions of years to yield the barrels of oil that are being drilled today, and not all oil is necessarily able to be extracted. And experts say there's no clear measurement that puts oil as the planet's ""second most abundant liquid.""

20.HowDisinformationCou,"
In 2016, Russian operatives used Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to sow division among American voters and boost Donald Trump's presidential campaign. 
What the Russians used to accomplish this is called ""disinformation,"" which is false or misleading content intended to deceive or promote discord. Now, with the first presidential primary vote only five months away, the public should be aware of the sources and types of online disinformation likely to surface during the 2020 election.
First, the Russians will be back. Don't be reassured by the notorious Russian Internet Research Agency's relatively negligible presence during last year's midterm elections. The agency might have been keeping its powder dry in anticipation of the 2020 presidential race. And it helped that U.S. Cyber Command, an arm of the military, reportedly blocked the agency's internet access for a few days right before the election in November 2018.
Temporarily shutting down the Internet Research Agency won't be enough to stop the flow of harmful content. Lee Foster, who leads the disinformation team at the cybersecurity firm FireEye, told me in an interview that the agency is ""a small component of the overall Russian operation,"" which also includes Moscow's military intelligence service and possibly other organizations. Over time, Foster said, ""All of these actors rework their approaches and tactics.""
And there's more to fear than just the Russians. I'm the author of a new report on disinformation and the 2020 election published by the New York University Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. In the report, I predict that the Russians won't be alone in spreading disinformation in 2020. Their most likely imitator will be Iran, especially if hostility between Tehran and Washington continues to mount. 






Disinformation isn't just Russian
In May, acting on a tip from FireEye, Facebook took down nearly 100 Iranian-related accounts, pages and groups. The Iranian network had used fake American identities to espouse both conservative and liberal political views, while also promoting extremely divisive anti-Saudi, anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian themes.
As Senate Intelligence Committee co-chair Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, has said, ""The Iranians are now following the Kremlin's playbook."" 

We also learned today that the Iranians are now following the Kremlin's playbook from 2016.
-- Mark Warner (@MarkWarner) August 21, 2018
 
While foreign election interference has dominated discussion of disinformation, most intentionally false content targeting U.S. social media is generated by domestic sources.
I believe that will continue to be the case in 2020. President Trump often uses Twitter to circulate conspiracy theories and cast his foes as corrupt. One story line he pushes is that Facebook, Twitter and Google are colluding with Democrats to undermine him. Introducing a right-wing ""social media summit"" at the White House in July, he tweeted about the ""tremendous dishonesty, bias, discrimination, and suppression practiced by certain companies.""
Supporters of Democrats also have trafficked in disinformation. In December 2017, a group of liberal activists created fake Facebook pages designed to mislead conservative voters in a special U.S. Senate race in Alabama. Matt Osborne, who has acknowledged being involved in the Alabama scheme, told me that in 2020, ""you're going to see a movement toward [political spending from undisclosed sources] on digital campaigns in the closing days of the race.""  He suggests there could be an effort to discourage Republicans from voting with ""an image of a red wave with a triumphal statement that imbues them with a sense of inevitable victory: 'No need to bother voting. Trump has got it in the bag.'"" 






Spreading fake videos
Also likely to surface next year: ""deepfake"" videos. This technique produces highly convincing - but false - images and audio. In a recent letter to the CEOs of Facebook, Google and Twitter, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, wrote: ""A timely, convincing deepfake video of a candidate"" that goes viral on a platform ""could hijack a race - and even alter the course of history. ... The consequences for our democracy could be devastating.""

Just one example of a deepfake video.

Instagram could be a vehicle for deepfakes. Owned by Facebook, the photo and video platform played a much bigger role in Russia's manipulation of the 2016 U.S. election than most people realize, and it could be exploited again in 2020. The Russian Internet Research Agency enjoyed more user engagement on Instagram than it did on any other platform, according to a December 2018 report commissioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee. ""Instagram is likely to be a key battleground on an ongoing basis,"" the report added.
Companies could step up
The social media companies are responding to the problem of disinformation by improving their artificial intelligence filters and hiring thousands of additional employees devoted to safety and security. ""The companies are getting much better at detection and removal of fake accounts,"" Dipayan Ghosh, co-director of the Harvard Kennedy School's Platform Accountability Project, told me.  






But the companies do not completely remove much of the content they pinpoint as false; they merely reduce how often it appears for users, and sometimes post a message noting that it's false.
In my view, provably false material should be eliminated from feeds and recommendations, with a copy retained in a cordoned-off archive available for research purposes to scholars, journalists and others.
Another problem is that responsibility for content decisions now tends to be scattered among different teams within each of the social media companies. Our report recommends that to streamline and centralize, each company should hire a senior official who reports to the CEO and is responsible for overseeing the fight against disinformation. Such executives could marshal resources more easily within each company and more effectively coordinate efforts across social media companies. 
Finally, the platforms could also cooperate more than they currently do to stamp out disinformation. They've collaborated effectively to root out child pornography and terrorist incitement. I believe they now have a collective responsibility to rid the coming election of as much disinformation as possible. An electorate that has been fed lies about candidates and issues can't make informed decisions. Votes will be based on falsehoods. And that means the future of American democracy - in 2020 and beyond - depends on dealing effectively with disinformation.

As Russia continues its attack on Ukraine, misinformation continues to spread about the conflict.
""Putin bombs Biden-owned villa in Ukraine while hammering biolabs & pedophile rings,"" reads the headline of a recent story by Real Raw News, a website that regularly publishes made-up stories.
And this story is no different -- it was fabricated.
We found no evidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin bombed property owned by President Joe Biden or that the president owns any villas in Ukraine. Claims about nefarious biolabs in Ukraine -- some supposedly ""U.S. owned"" -- have permeated social media since the Russian invasion. But these claims are also bogus, and part of disinformation efforts by Russians. And the claim about ""pedophile rings"" is unsubstantiated.

His websites publish information under the pseudonym ""Michael Baxter."" 
The website's ""About Us"" page features a disclaimer saying it ""contains humor, parody and satire,"" but the author of the articles often insists in the site's comment sections that the content is legitimate.

There are no U.S.-run biolabs in Ukraine. Ukraine is one of many former Soviet Union republics, and other countries, partnering with the U.S. Defense Department as part of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program to improve public health laboratories and prevent the threat of outbreaks of infectious diseases. 
While the U.S. may provide funding to upgrade or build labs in other countries, the labs are run by the partnering nations and the program's goal is to prevent biological threats, not create them.
""These laboratories have recently played an important role in stopping the spread of COVID-19,"" Andy Weber, a member of the Arms Control Association Board of Directors and a former assistant secretary of defense for nuclear, chemical, and biological defense programs, previously told PolitiFact. 
That effort is part of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, which began in 1991 to reduce the threat of existing weapons of mass destruction programs in former Soviet republics.

70.WasRihannaBannedFrom,"
Superstars like Jay-Z, Beyonce and Katy Perry are the common targets of conspiracy theorists who claim the stars are either secret Satanists or part of the Illuminati -- a shadowy, elite (and non-existent) cabal of ultra-wealthy celebrities, bankers and politicians who secretly rule the world. 
So when YourNewsWire.com -- a well-known purveyor of fake news and conspiracy theories -- reported in February 2018 that Rihanna had been banned from entering Senegal ""because she's 'Illuminati,'"" you could be forgiven for dismissing the story out of hand. 
For once, however, there is something to these claims about dissent against Rihanna's visit to the West African nation. Activists did protest against the singer's appearance at an event in Senegal and did accuse Rihanna of being part of the Illuminati, but the government did not ban her from entering the country and she did ultimately visit.  
""Protestors have violently blocked Rihanna from entering the West African nation of Senegal,"" YourNewsWire.com wrote, ""because of her 'affiliation with the Illuminati,' according to reports.""
The protests turned ""violent"", according to local reports, as protestors claimed Rihanna has aligned herself with the Illuminati, a shadowy group of global elites working to establish a New World Order. 
The protestors are backed by politicians and religious leaders in the country who have also been working to block Rihanna's visit to Senegal, claiming that she flaunts her membership of the Illuminati. 






The post cites a 1 February report by the Paris-based Jeune Afrique (which translates to ""Young Africa"") news web site. That article reads:
Expected in Senegal on Friday, the singer is not welcome in the eyes of around 30 religious organizations united under the collective name ""No to freemasonry and homosexuality."" Some members suspect her of being a member of the freemasons. 
The article was published a day before Rihanna's visit to Senegal in early February where she joined other global dignitaries, including French President Emmanuel Macron, at an event promoting education in developing countries. She was due to attend in her capacity as an ambassador for the Global Partnership for Education, a Washington, DC-based group that supports basic schooling in 65 nations. 
According to Jeune Afrique, the protest against Rihanna's visit was prompted, in part, by a YouTube video posted last week which outlined a conspiracy theory around claiming Rihanna's visit to the country ""was orchestrated with the complicity of the government, in order to roll out an educational regime that aims to create future generations of loyal disciples of Satan.""
""Rihanna doesn't hide it,"" said Cheikh Oumar Diagne, a spokesperson for the collective, ""she is part of the Illuminati, which is a branch of the freemasons.""
He adds:
In fact, her visit oddly coincides with the originally scheduled date of the [association of African freemasonry lodges.] From our point of view, this is an attempt at a distraction to hide this freemason meeting from the public. 
The meeting of African freemasons was due to take place between 2 and 3 February in the Senegalese capital of Dakar, but was cancelled after opposition from the same religious collective forced a local hotel to pull out as the venue.  






In the end, Rihanna's visit to Senegal went ahead, and she appeared at the conference with French President Emmanuel Macron, as well as Senegal's president Macky Sall, and gave a short address to the audience.

While the YourNewsWire.com article contains a rare kernel of truth and accurately cites articles by reputable news organizations like Jeune Afrique and The Guardian, it also indulges in its customary touting of conspiracy theories, falsely claiming that Rihanna describes herself as an ""Illuminati Princess"" and that she had been ""caught instructing children to pray to Satan.""
Furthermore, the article falsely claimed that the singer had been barred from entering Senegal. Rihanna appears to have been given a warm welcome by the country's government.

21.DidMarjorieTaylorGre,"
In January 2021, after the 118th Congress was sworn in, attention turned to the record and background of U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, who promoted the far-right QAnon cluster of conspiracy theories and gained the support of former President Donald Trump during her campaign. 
On Jan. 19, left-leaning Media Matters for America revealed that in 2018, Greene had explicitly endorsed the false and damaging conspiracy theory that the Parkland mass shooting, which left 17 people dead at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida in February 2018, had been faked in order to justify a crackdown on gun rights.
A week later, CNN reported that Greene had ""liked"" Facebook posts that called for the assassination of high-profile Democratic politicians. In response, Greene said those particular actions had been taken by other unnamed individuals who have managed her Facebook page. 
On Jan. 27, social media users began sharing a video which they described as showing Greene harassing or confronting David Hogg, a former Stoneman Douglas High School student and survivor of the mass shooting there, who has gone on to become a gun control activist. Since 2018, Hogg has been a frequent target of disinformation and baseless conspiracy theories for his role as a public advocate on behalf of those killed in the Parkland massacre.
Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter Jaime was murdered in the shooting, posted the video clip along with the following caption:
[Marjorie Taylor Greene], is this you harassing [David Hogg] weeks after the Parkland shooting, that my daughter was killed in & he was in? Calling him a coward for ignoring your insanity. I will answer all of your questions in person. Get ready to record again. 







A similar, widely-shared tweet was posted by the journalist Yashar Ali, who wrote that the video showed Greene ""trolling"" Hogg. 
Those descriptions were accurate. The woman at the center of the video was indeed Greene, and the man who was the subject of her ire was indeed Hogg. Greene posted the video to her own YouTube account in January 2020, and it remained published there at time of writing. However, the video was recorded during Greene's visit to Washington, D.C., in March 2019. The confrontation in question did not take place mere ""weeks"" after the Parkland massacre, as Guttenberg claimed, but rather just over a year later.
In fact, Snopes has uncovered evidence that Greene followed and harangued Hogg on two separate occasions during that visit. Her purpose was ostensibly to lobby members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives to oppose ""Red Flag"" gun laws, which authorize law enforcement agencies to exercise emergency gun confiscation powers in cases where an individual is flagged by loved ones as being at immediate risk of doing serious harm to themselves or others.
Two Confrontations
The first confrontation took place on March 25, 2019, and was streamed live on Greene's Facebook page. The video has since been removed, but a cached version shows that Greene described it as having taken place inside U.S. Senate offices, called it ""a surprise David Hogg confrontation,"" and said ""This was the first one when we came across their group inside.""
Later that day, Greene conducted an interview with Will Johnson, a far-right social media personality who once had his own show on the conspiracy theorist platform Infowars, and now runs a platform called ""Unite America First."" That interview contained a clip from Greene's confrontation with Hogg (apparently the one streamed live on Greene's Facebook account earlier that day).
In prefacing the footage, Greene complained that Hogg and his fellow activists appeared to have garnered more media coverage than her, and expressed frustration that he appeared to have been able to secure a greater number of meetings with senators and representatives while she, in many cases, found lawmakers unwilling to meet with her, or did not receive any response to her requests. At one point, Johnson calls Hogg ""pretty despicable,"" to which Greene responds ""Yes."" 






At the time of the confrontation, Hogg was 18 years old. His youth clearly appears to have been a consideration for Greene, who told Johnson she had checked his Wikipedia page and found he was 18 years old which meant, in her view, ""I'm not picking on a kid.""
In the footage itself, which can be viewed below, Greene can be seen following Hogg and his associates through hallways amid U.S. Senate offices. Hogg never demonstrates any willingness to speak with Greene, and the confrontation appears entirely uninvited and unsolicited on his part.
Nonetheless, Greene continues to follow Hogg, shouting a series of questions and statements at him about gun control policy, red flag laws and, provocatively, the Parkland shooting itself, of which Hogg is himself a survivor. At one point, Greene shouts at Hogg, ""If the FBI had followed through on their tips, then Nikolas Cruz wouldn't have been able to kill 17 people in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School."" 
Later in the video, Greene assails Hogg for his youth and supposed naivety, in an apparent contradiction of her earlier explanation that, since Hogg was 18 years old, he should be treated as an adult: ""David Hogg, you don't even know what you have. You're so young you cannot realize that the right to bear arms is what makes America so great.""



The second confrontation is the one shown in the videos posted by Guttenberg, Ali and others in January 2021. Based on descriptions contained in a Big League Politics report, it appears to have taken place later on the same day, Mar. 25, 2019.  
The video, as posted to Greene's YouTube channel, can be viewed below. It again shows Greene following Hogg, this time outside on a sidewalk, shouting questions and statements at him. Again, she makes provocative pronouncements about the mass shooting which Hogg himself survived, and accuses him of ""using kids as a barrier."" 
At no point does Hogg engage with Greene, or respond to her, much to the visible frustration of the future Congresswoman. After she ends her pursuit of Hogg, Greene turns to the camera and says ""He's a coward, he can't say one word to defend his stance, because there is no defense for taking away guns.""





In the days after her brief visit to Washington, D.C., Greene repeatedly advertised and promoted her confrontations with Hogg on Facebook and Twitter.
Reacting to the renewed coverage of the footage in January 2021, Lauren Hogg -- a sister of David's and herself a survivor of the Parkland shooting and a gun control activist -- wrote on Twitter that:
""The harassment that [David Hogg] and I received in the aftermath of the shooting was so severe that I have more PTSD from the harassment and conspiracy theorists that we've had to deal with with than I do going through the actual shooting.""

73.LawyerAccusedofFlash,"
Claims that the ""Ok"" hand gesture are in fact a ""white power"" signal may have started as an online troll, but they've periodically swept social media ever since President Donald Trump took office. And on 4 September 2018, accusations flooded the online world when a White House lawyer was seen sitting behind Judge Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing with her right hand making what some viewersinterpreted as the ""white power"" gesture:

Bash's husband, U.S. attorney John Bash, took to Twitter to blast his wife's accusers, pointing out that she is of Jewish and Mexican descent, and saying the couple has ""nothing to do with hate groups, which aim to terrorize and demean other people -- never have and never would"":

Claims that members of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration have flashed ""white power"" symbols are not new. In February 2017, controversy erupted when a Reuters photographer captured Trump adviser Stephen Miller appearing to make the gesture. Similar claims were made again in January 2018 when White House intern Jack Breuer was seen making the gesture during a group photograph. In Miller's case, the absence of video footage made it unclear whether he was flashing the gesture purposely or merely accidentally did so while flaring his fingers to adjust his suit. In the latter case, Breuer said he was mimicking a gesticulation President Trump often makes during speeches and denied he was making a white power sign.
Because we can't read minds, we can't discern what anyone's true intentions were in the realm of hand positioning. According to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), an organization that tracks hate groups, the gesture started as a hoax on the Internet message board 4chan in reaction to the sudden rash of media scrutiny placed on white supremacists and the alt-right after the 2016 presidential election:
The ""OK"" hand gesture hoax originated in February 2017 when an anonymous 4channer announced ""Operation O-KKK,"" telling other members that ""we must flood Twitter and other social media websites ... claiming that the OK hand sign is a symbol of white supremacy."" The user even provided a helpful graphic showing how the letters WP (for ""white power"") could be traced within an ""OK"" gesture. The originator and others also suggested useful hashtags to help spread the hoax, such as #PowerHandPrivilege and #NotOkay. ""Leftists have dug so deep down into their lunacy,"" wrote the poster, ""We must force [them] to dig more, until the rest of society ain't going anywhere near that s***.""
The gesture has been used in the past by what the ADL refers to as ""alt right"" and ""alt lite"" -- far right extremists who range from outright white supremacists to those who publicly shun racists but otherwise fall in step with their belief systems. White supremacist Richard Spencer infamously flashed the sign in front of Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.:
 






When we wrote about the issue eight months ago, Mark Pitcavage, senior research fellow at the ADL's Center on Extremism, told us that even though the gesture amounted to little more than trolling, that didn't mean it couldn't evolve into something more sinister:
Right now whenever anyone is using it in this context it's very sort of ironic and trolling. But if it persists there's a chance the ironic aspects of it might fall away with time. That happens organically and it's way too soon to know if the usage will just drop off once they get bored with it, or if they continue to using it ironically in a trolling fashion, or something else.
A few days after the original brouhaha, images of Zina Bash making the same symbol at a subsequent day of the Senate hearings were circulated online:

Dear @USAttyBash,
Remember your long, whiny rant about people being unfair to your wife's hand gesture?
Yeah, we're going to need you both to **** off now. pic.twitter.com/JQX6oRFADV
-- The Hoarse Whisperer (@HoarseWisperer) September 7, 2018

This behavior drove speculation that Bash (in the second case) was trolling those who had criticized her the first time around:

Following accusations that she openly displayed a white supremacist hand gesture during one of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, Zina Bash stoked the flames by making the exact same gesture during another session.
Bash once again took a seat behind Kavanaugh and sparked a huge online debate as to whether she deliberately made an OK sign with one of her hands while crossing her arms.
On the third day of testimony from Kavanaugh, Bash was recorded yawning behind the judge before once again flashing an OK sign. However, this time Bash appeared to knowingly look directly into the camera while making the otherwise innocuous gesture.
Once again, social media was filled with speculation that Bash was trolling those who'd suggested she was making a white-power gesture last time.

Snopes is still fighting an ""infodemic"" of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help. Find out what we've learned and how to inoculate yourself against COVID-19 misinformation. Read the latest fact checks about the vaccines. Submit any questionable rumors and ""advice"" you encounter. Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease.



 







In mid-2020, the American biotechnology company Moderna received prominent news coverage about their efforts to develop a vaccine to deal with the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.
At that time, internet users were circulating a bit of text tying Moderna to infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Hungarian-born financier George Soros, and American financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, figures who previously had all been the subjects of various baseless conspiracy theories.
The text linking Moderna with all of these public figures and implying they were involved in some nebulous but nefarious plot appeared to have been a completely tongue-in-cheek spoof of groundless conspiracy theories, but many readers who skimmed it at least wondered if it might have at least some substance to it:

The vaccine that is coming...
As many of you heard Moderna is in stage 3 of their vaccine testing. 
If all goes well it'll become federal law to get the vaccine. 
Here's something many of you don't know, 
guess who the first CEO of Moderna was? 
A Cornell graduate by the name of Anthony Fauci, who was a roommate with none other than
Bill Gates. 
Are you paying attention? 
It was at Cornell that Bill Gates designed the RFID (Radio-frequency identification) and patented it under US2006257852. 
Are you awake yet? 
Now let's really go down the rabbit hole. 
Moderna was a pharmaceutical company that started in Germany under the name IG Farben. 
IG Farben is infamous for it's mass production of Zyklon-B, the primary gas used to kill millions during the Holocaust. 
After Germany fell, IG Farben was dissolved and its assets sold off by a Nazi turned American by the name of, you guessed it, George Soros. 
Soros rebranded the company as Moderna. 
And who was the primary stockholder of Moderna until his death? 
Jeffrey Epstein. 
His role in Moderna is where he made his fortune and established his connections. 
Let that sink in.
Wake up people!
You are being conditioned and controlled.

For the ""Is this true?"" record, we note the following:
1) Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), has never been the CEO of Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna.  Fauci has been the director of NIAID since 1984, while ModeRNA Therapeutics was not founded until 2010.  Fauci also graduated from Cornell University Medical College in 1966 and therefore could not possibly have been college roommates with technology mogul Bill Gates, who attended Harvard College for a few years in the mid-1970s.
2) Bill Gates, who did not attend Cornell, also did not design or patent radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips. The first such patent was taken out in 1973 by Mario Cardullo, and the patent number provided in the message text (US2006257852) actually points to a patent related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus rather than any RFID technology.
3) Notorious chemical and pharmaceutical company IG Farben was not ""dissolved"" after World War II by George Soros, who was not a Nazi (or a German) and was only 14 years old when Germany surrendered in 1945.  The victorious Allied powers seized IG Farben's surviving assets and split the firm up into smaller constituent companies.
4) Financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was convicted of sex offenses in 2008 and committed suicide in his jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges, got his start in the world of finance as a trader at Bear Stearns in 1976 and later founded his own money-management consulting firm, Financial Trust Company.  
Exactly how much money Epstein had and how he acquired his wealth remain subjects of some mystery, but he was not the ""primary stockholder"" of Moderna, and he was already worth a reputed nine figures well before the 2010 founding of that company.

79.DidLiberalsSetUpaGoF,"
In August 2018, police in Iowa charged 24-year-old Cristhian Rivera with the murder of Mollie Tibbetts, a 20-year-old college student who had gone missing while jogging more than a month earlier. 
The investigation into the disappearance of Tibbetts had been closely followed on a national level for weeks, but the arrest of Rivera, who authorities say is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, prompted some commentators -- led by President Donald Trump -- to bring her death into the realm of politics. 
In a short video posted to Twitter, Trump used the murder of Tibbetts to advance his immigration policies, including the long-touted construction of a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico:

pic.twitter.com/wYCNmkkaNR
-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 22, 2018
 






The politicization of Tibbetts' death continued in the days following the arrest of Rivera, whom authorities in Iowa say led them to her remains and has confessed to the murder.
On 23 August, the right-wing junk news Facebook page ""Uncle Sam's Misguided Children"" posted a widely-shared meme which claimed that ""liberals"" had started a GoFundMe campaign to collectively raise $5,000,000 for Rivera's bail. It contained what was presented as a screenshot from the GoFundMe website, along with the introductory message: ""Liberals raising the bail money for a murder [sic] just #WalkAway.""
""Uncle Sam's Misguided Children"" added: ""Is this for real? Are Democrats raising money for this [piece of shit]?""

#WalkAway is an online campaign which purports to represent individuals who have left the Democratic party, supposedly in dismay at left-wing policies and vehement criticism or disparagement of President Donald Trump. A Twitter tracking tool called Hamilton68, which is run by the Alliance for Securing Democracy, has found that Russian bot networks have boosted the spread of the #WalkAway hashtag. 
The meme was also promoted in several widely-shared tweets, including one posted by the self-described ""investigative journalist"" Laura Loomer, who has a track record of fabricating and perpetuating conspiracy theories:

Soooooooo@jihadwatchRS can't have a @gofundme for his journalism, but #MollieTibbetts's illegal immigrant murderer can? ?
We need a very powerful lawyer of group of lawyers to sue these tech companies for violation of public accommodation laws.
This is absolutely absurd. pic.twitter.com/dnEOoQcGNv
-- Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) August 23, 2018
 






The meme's central claim is false. Nobody (liberal or otherwise) has set up a GoFundMe campaign to raise Rivera's bail (which is, in fact, $5,000,000.) The meme features some sloppy image editing, for example the jarring difference in font between ""$117,504"" and ""of 5,000,000 to make bail."" 

It also contains mistakes. On the actual GoFundMe website, the feature which shows how much money a campaign has raised always follows the same format: ""$9,999 of $99,999 goal,"" as shown in the example below:

In the GoFundMe mobile app, the same feature is slightly different, always following the format ""$9,999 raised of $99,999 goal."" Neither the website or app display this meter with a description of the campaign (such as ""to make bail"") affixed to the end, and they always include dollar signs before every amount (which is not the case in the fake ""Cristhian Rivera"" meme.)
As well being crudely doctored, the ""Uncle Sam's Misguided Children"" meme does not follow either of these formats, which establishes that it is a fake. 
No campaign relating to Cristhian Rivera's bail existed on GoFundMe as of 24 August 2018, as a quick search of the website shows. (Neither did any such campaign exist under ""Christian Rivera,"" as the suspect's name is sometimes misspelled, or ""Cristhian Bahena Rivera,"" his full name.) Furthermore, no such campaign had ever existed.
When a campaign is removed from GoFundMe, it remains discoverable on search engines. For example, in August 2018 GoFundMe deleted a potentially fraudulent campaign purporting to raise funds for medical care for a Trump supporter supposedly attacked with a brick in Arizona. Performing a Google search for the title of the campaign (""Darrell's medical bills"") still yields a residual URL for that campaign:

However, when one clicks on that link, the GoFundMe website displays an error message which indicates that the page no longer exists:

The purported name of the campaign in the ""Uncle Sam's Misguided Children"" meme is simply ""Cristhian Rivera,"" but a Google search for a GoFundMe campaign of that name does not yield any residual webpages -- another sign that no such campaign ever existed. 
""Uncle Sam's Misguided Children"" is a hyperpartisan Facebook page which frequently posts misleading or fake content and memes, some of which we have debunked previously. 
A separate campaign relating to Rivera (but not mentioning his bail) was launched on 22 August. It, too, used his mugshot but it was titled ""Iowa billboard"" and aimed to purchase a billboard which would show Rivera's photograph along with the slogan ""Vote Democrat: No border. No wall. Just death for you all.""

18.Afactcheckersguideto,"
Virginia Thomas, a conservative activist and the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, made a series of false and conspiratorial claims shortly after the 2020 election in text messages to Mark Meadows, former President Donald Trump's chief of staff, imploring him to press forward in an effort to overturn the election.
The Washington Post and CBS News first obtained copies of the text messages written by Thomas, who goes by Ginni, and reported on their contents March 24 after confirming them with five unnamed people who had seen them. Major media outlets have since corroborated the texts; CNN said it reviewed the messages, and the New York Times, NBC News and ABC News confirmed their authenticity through other unnamed sources.
The Jan. 6 House committee has not released the texts. Meadows' attorney, George Terwilliger III, confirmed the existence of the messages to the Washington Post. While PolitiFact has not seen the texts or heard back from Thomas or Terwilliger, we do not doubt that the messages are authentic.
The 29 messages between Thomas and Meadows were among more than 2,000 texts Meadows turned over to the committee as part of its fact-finding mission regarding the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. What stood out to us were several messages from Thomas that repeated code language for conspiracy theories as she urged Meadows to reject the election results.
Thomas has been affiliated with several conservative groups, including the Council for National Policy, which sought to keep Trump in power. She told the Washington Free Beacon in March that she attended the Jan. 6 rally that Trump held shortly before the attack on the Capitol, but that she left early. 
The messages highlighted in early news reports show Thomas rehashing false claims from Trump and his allies that the election was stolen or rigged. They also echoed QAnon, the sprawling and baseless conspiracy theory centered around the belief that a secret cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles, including many top Democrats and celebrities, is operating a global sex-trafficking ring that Trump was recruited to take down. The messages included references to ""watermarked ballots,"" ""white hats,"" Guantanamo Bay tribunals and other staples of QAnon lore.
Here's our fact-checking guide to the texts.
Thomas' references to QAnon
What Thomas wrote: 
""Watermarked ballots in over 12 states have been part of a huge Trump & military white hat sting operation in 12 key battleground states."" 
The facts: 
Thomas sent Meadows a link to a YouTube video on Nov. 5, 2020, called, ""TRUMP STING w CIA Director Steve Pieczenik, The Biggest Election Story in History, QFS-BLOCKCHAIN."" The video is no longer on YouTube.
Pieczenik, a former State Department official, is a far-right commentator who has appeared often on Alex Jones' InfoWars channel, and who has joined Jones in referring to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn., as a ""false flag.""
In the world of conspiracy theories, QFS stands for ""Quantum Financial System.""
The imaginary QFS financial system is rooted in older conspiracy theories that said a sweeping 1980s proposal to reform the U.S. economy was secretly passed into law and kept under wraps by the government, but would one day come into effect, wrote researcher Mike Rothschild in his book about QAnon.  
""The gist is that at some point, all currencies will be 'revalued' to have the same exchange rate (possibly pegged to gold or the dollar), taxes and debt will be wiped away, and anyone holding vast amounts of low-value currency like the Iraqi dinar or the Vietnamese dong will instantly be wealthy,"" Rothschild told PolitiFact in an email. ""It's absolute nonsense.""
PolitiFact found versions of what appear to be the same video on Rumble and Bitchute. 
In it, Pieczenik used the term QFS to describe ""a sting operation"" initiated by Trump in which every ballot was ""watermarked"" with a ""QFS blockchain"" encryption code and National Guard soldiers were deployed to 12 different states. Snopes rated the video's claims False.
PolitiFact debunked a viral Facebook post that was highlighted in the video, rating the posts's claim about ""watermarked"" ballots Pants on Fire. There was no evidence of such an elaborate plot to catch any alleged cheating by Democrats. The federal government does not print or issue ballots.
The watermarked ballots claim was popular among QAnon adherents, with ""watch the water"" becoming a go-to refrain on QAnon message boards. ""White hats"" is also used in QAnon lingo to refer to those in the military and government who were allied with their cause.

A man held a sign related to the QAnon conspiracy theory outside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
What Thomas wrote: 
""Biden crime family & ballot fraud co-conspirators (elected officials, bureaucrats, social media censorship mongers, fake stream media reporters, etc) are being arrested & detained for ballot fraud right now & over coming days, & will be living in barges off GITMO to face military tribunals for sedition.""
The facts:
Thomas' claim that public figures in politics, government, tech and the media were being rounded up and shipped to Guantanamo Bay for military tribunals ""is the essence of QAnon,"" Rothschild said. Vice reported that Thomas' text ""directly quoted a passage floating around on QAnon message boards.""
Many of the earliest posts from ""Q,"" the anonymous poster who claimed to be a military insider and whose writings on fringe internet forums inspired the movement, talked of expanding Gitmo and referenced mass arrests of Democrats, celebrities and banking elites, Rothschild said. 
Many adherents of QAnon have long believed that Trump's efforts would culminate in a mass unsealing of indictments called ""the storm.""
""Q"" has not posted a message since December 2020, but baseless internet rumors describing military arrests and Guantanamo Bay executions of top Democrats have lived on courtesy of influencers and websites that push the QAnon theories, such as Real Raw News.
Thomas' false election claims
What Thomas wrote: 
""The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History.""
The facts: 
This is false; there was no ""heist."" 
Biden won the presidency by amassing the necessary Electoral College votes through flipping battleground states that went for Trump in 2016.
On Nov. 7, 2020, the Associated Press reported that Biden won Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes, reaching the combined 270 electoral votes across multiple states to win the presidency. 
A scheme to steal the election for Biden would have required election workers in thousands of cities and counties to coordinate a massive fraud, risking felony charges and prison time. By the date of Thomas' text, Nov. 10, 2020, judges in multiple states had rejected lawsuits filed on Trump's behalf that challenged vote counting procedures. 
What Thomas said: 
""Sounds like Sidney and her team are getting inundated with evidence of fraud. Make a plan. Release the Kraken and save us from the left taking America down.""
The facts:
Thomas was referring to lawyer Sidney Powell, who falsely claimed Trump won the election in a landslide and regularly shared content related to QAnon, in this Nov. 19, 2020, text.
Powell was part of the unsuccessful effort to file lawsuits in battleground states that Trump lost. In a series of discredited allegations that later triggered expensive defamation lawsuits, she also accused voting technology companies of changing election results. 
The phrase ""release the Kraken"" comes from the 1981 movie ""Clash of the Titans,"" but Powell and others adopted the phrase after the 2020 election to refer to the false allegations of election fraud that she claimed would invalidate Biden's election.
In a 2021 court filing defending her against one of the defamation lawsuits, Powell's attorneys wrote that ""no reasonable person"" would conclude that her claims were statements of fact.

04.BillboardsPromoting4,"
In May 2018, a Reddit user posted the image of a billboard in southern Oklahoma to the subreddit ""greatawakening,"" which is dedicated to a largely incoherent, ever-widening conspiracy theory known as ""The Storm""  (with the hashtag #QAnon) that involves an anonymous group of ""highly placed"" government individuals nobly fighting the corruption of the ""Deep State"" (that is to say, the civil servants who work within the American government) while representing themselves as someone going only by ""Q"":

The billboard sports an oversized, American flag-bedazzled letter ""Q,"" next to which is the text ""Where We Go One We Go All"" -- a popular Q slogan which apparently is a line in the 1996 Jeff Bridges movie White Squall, whose plot involves people surviving a storm (the name of the conspiracy!) on a sailboat (a metaphor!) The billboard primarily promotes the website ""DoUKnowQ.com,"" which -- though it has the appearance of being informative -- seems primarily concerned with pure profit.
An archived version of the website from May 2018 shows that it was once in the business of selling Q-related website domains at a significant markup. Now, their ""online store"" links to a Cafepress web shop selling Q branded merchandise like T-shirts and mugs. 
We called the company that owns that billboard space -- Lindmark Outdoor Media -- to confirm that the billboard was real and to inquire about its origins. A representative who answered a call to their corporate office told us that the billboard -- which is found between exits 21 and 24 on southbound I-35 north of the Texas border -- was real, that it had been rented since 1 May 2018, and that it appeared to be booked through to the end of the year. 






We asked what group paid for the ad, and were first told that it was not a group but an individual. Though we were told they could not disclose any information about this person, the first representative we spoke to at Lindmark used the word ""she"" to refer to the owner multiple times. A follow-up call from our managing editor yielded a statement from a different representative of the company. That individual told us:

As far as the billboard itself, we don't know anything about the people behind the billboard and what it means, as far as that goes, we can't give away people's names. We don't like to get involved with anything political. I had never heard of them until we looked them up on the internet, to make sure it wasn't political -- we don't like any of that sort of thing.

On 29 June 2018, a tweet from Daily Beast tech and internet reporter Will Sommer suggested that the phenomena of Q-inspired billboards was not limited to Oklahoma:

QAnon billboards are a thing now. This one's in Georgia. pic.twitter.com/VQ0Hn3T7h6
-- Will Sommer (@willsommer) June 29, 2018

There have been multiple pictures of this same billboard, which suggest that the billboard is real and that it is just south of the Tennessee border in northern Georgia on northbound I-75. Dixieland Fireworks, occupying the billboard space directly above the QANON billboard, is located right off the first I-75 exit after passing north into Tennessee.
The Georgia billboard, unlike the Oklahoma one, does not appear to be motivated by any sort of profit -- it merely contains the hashtag ""#QANON"" and the text ""Truth is Freedom."" It is unclear what advertising firm owns that billboard space, however. The most prominent firm in this region is Lamar Advertising. We spoke with the sales manager of their Rome, Georgia office to ask if the billboard was theirs. She was not familiar with the advertisement, and after a search of their records and a discussion with their graphic designer, she told us they are confident it does not belong to them.
The only other possible firm it could belong to, based on our discussion with Lamar, would be a company called Fairway Outdoor Advertising. We spoke with a representative of that company who was unaware of the advertisement, and who forwarded us to their sales manager. We reached out to him via e-mail and voicemail, but have not received a response.
The basis (if you want to call it that) for ""The Storm"" conspiracy theory are ""breadcrumbs"" of vague information or aphorisms left by ""Q"" on the misogynistic, racist, and troll-filled online messageboard that is 4chan. The beauty of the conspiracy is that these nuggets of information are so meaningless that people can interpret them literally any way they want, and then retroactively attribute current events as having been predicted by this anonymous entity. 
Another beauty, apparently, is that anyone can buy a billboard and claim to be involved.

93.TheDyatlovPassIncide,"
In 1959, the frozen bodies of a nine-member ski-hiking expedition that had gone missing weeks weeks before in northern Urals of the Soviet Union were found near their campsite on a mountain called Kholat Syakhl (which, according to Russian sources, means ""Dead Mountain"" in the indigenous Mansi language).
Made up mostly of students and graduates from the Ural Polytechnic Institute a few hundred miles away in Yekaterinburg (then called Sverdlovsk), the team had set out on 27 January to reach another mountain about 7 miles away, Gora Otorten (which means ""Don't Go There"" in Mansi). After being sidetracked by a snowstorm, they pitched a tent on the eastern slope of Kholat Syakhl on 2 February. That night they died. Apart from the fact that they froze to death, no one knows why.
Police and military investigators charged with solving the case were baffled by what they found. The skiers' tent had been sliced open from the inside and hurriedly abandoned. Their belongings were still inside, but the skiers weren't. The placement and condition of their bodies, some found as far as a kilometer-and-a-half (almost a mile) from the tent and buried under four meters (13 feet) of snow, were odd -- to say the least.
An April 2013 article in the The Telegraph described the grisly scene:
Investigators found footprints in the snow of eight or nine people who were wearing socks, a single shoe or were barefoot. The footsteps led towards a dense forest but disappeared after 500 metres.
The first two bodies, of two men, barefoot and dressed only in their underclothes, were found at the edge of the forest near the remains of a fire. The next three bodies -- of [expedition leader Igor] Dyatlov and another man and a woman -- were found between the fire and the tent, suggesting that they had been trying to return to the tent. Autopsies failed to find any evidence of foul play. An inquest concluded that all five had died of hypothermia.
Two months later, however, the partially-dressed bodies of the other four members of the team were discovered in a forest ravine, not far from the first two bodies. They appeared to have suffered traumatic pressure or crush injuries, and the tongue of one had been ripped out. Otherwise there were no external injuries, but tests conducted on their bodies and clothing showed small traces of radiation. 






The investigators concluded, enigmatically, that the skiers died because because they encountered a ""natural force they were unable to overcome."" Public access to the site was banned for three years. The results of the investigation were classified.
If ever there was a sure-fire recipe to whip up rumors and conspiracy theories, this was it. The conclusion was vague. The evidence was under lock and key. There were too many questions left unanswered.
Why, for example, did the skiers flee the relative safety of the tent? Why did they leave their belongings (including warmer clothing) behind? Why did some of them simply freeze to death, while others showed signs of internal trauma? Who or what removed the tongue of one of the victims? Why were there traces of radiation on their clothing?
And what about the UFOs?
Fireballs in the Sky
It was reported that eyewitnesses in the northern Urals saw fast-moving ""balls of fire"" in the night sky around the time of the Dyatlov Pass incident. It has been suggested, plausibly, that these were Soviet missile or rocket tests. But another theory -- and here we encounter the earliest paranormal explanation of the incident -- holds that the fireballs (whatever they in fact may have been) exploded or emitted a beam of unspecified ""energy"" that directly caused the skiers' deaths.
That theory was proposed 31 years after the fact, oddly enough, by one of the original investigators in the case, a former public prosecutor named Lev Ivanov. But Ivanov's fireball theory presupposes that the reported sightings match up with the actual date of the incident (2 February), an assumption that has been challenged by another author, Russian mountaineer Evgeny Buyanov, who says he found no verifiable reports of unidentified flying objects in the Urals on those dates.
Before Ivanov's 1990 article came out, the predominant explanations for the Dyatlov deaths focused on straightforward natural causes -- avalanche or animal attack, for example (human attack, though not impossible, was ruled out by investigators for lack of evidence) -- or secret government activity, such as a military or KGB operation the skiers unknowingly stumbled upon. Despite the declassification and release of the case files in the intervening years (the contents of which were eventually published online), the original documents did little to resolve lingering quandaries, and in fact only seemed to prompt further outlandish speculation. 






The Yeti Hypothesis
The most outlandish hypothesis to date was that proposed in a June 2014 Discovery Channel ""documentary"" called (spoiler alert!) Russian Yeti: The Killer Lives. This is from the press release announcing the show's first airing:
On February 2, 1959, nine college students hiked up the icy slopes of the Ural Mountains in the heart of Russia but never made it out alive. Investigators have never been able to give a definitive answer behind who -- or what -- caused the bizarre crime scene. Fifty-five years later, American explorer Mike Libecki reinvestigates the mystery -- known as The Dyatlov Pass incident -- but what he uncovers is truly horrifying ...
Following the trail of evidence, Mike finds proof that the hikers were not alone -- a photograph, taken by one of the hikers a day before they died that suggests that they encountered a Yeti.
Yes, you read that right. According to the Discovery Channel, the Dyatlov group met their deaths at the hands of a Yeti, also known as the Abominable Snowman (or, if you prefer, Bigfoot's Asian cousin).
It has long been rumored that Yeti-like beasts inhabit the wilds of Siberia and the Ural Mountains to the west, although, like everywhere else these so-called hairy hominids have allegedly been sighted, no one has come forward with verifiable evidence of their existence. Nevertheless, the show's host, Mike Libecki, said the Dyatlov Pass incident proves they're real.
""When I found out one of the students was missing a tongue immediately I knew this was not caused by an avalanche,"" Libecki said. ""Something ripped out the tongue of this woman.""
That something, Libecki naturally concluded, could only have been a Yeti. As further evidence, he presented an alleged photo of the Yeti (displayed in the tweet below) snapped by a member of the Dyatlov expedition:

Did this creature stalk and kill the 9 victims of the #dyatlovpass incident? Photo found on a victim's camera. #yeti pic.twitter.com/KOmTs2sZ70
-- Scott Philbrook (@AstonshngLegnds) September 2, 2015 






Yet no matter how many times one hears the out-of-focus figure described as a ""Yeti,"" or a ""creature,"" or something other than human, the fact is that it resembles nothing so much as an ordinary, adult male human being. And no matter how many times one repeats the claim that the only reasonable explanation for one of the Dyatlov bodies missing a tongue is that a Yeti pulled it out, it pales beside the straightforward hypothesis that her tongue was devoured by a scavenging animal or decomposed due to constant contact with the stream of running water where the body was found.
In any case, it wasn't just the tongue that was missing. According to the Dyatlov autopsy reports, also missing was some soft tissue around the woman's eyes, eyebrows, nose bridge, upper lip, and cheek bone -- not to mention the eyes themselves.
The problem with proposing Yeti attacks and killer UFOs as the answer to the Dyatlov puzzle is obvious: They render it more mysterious, not less. And while isn't entirely implausible that secret government shenanigans were in play (we are talking about the Cold War-era Soviet Union, after all), even that is speculative overreach insofar as it is based on assumptions, not evidence.
The Infrasound Hypothesis
The same applies to some of the putatively scientific explanations offered up in recent years. Author Donnie Eichar proposed in his 2013 book Dead Mountain: The Untold True Story of the Dyatlov Pass Incident, for example, that the skiers may have been driven to hysteria by infrasound waves caused by a weather phenomenon known as a Karman vortex street.
In simplest terms, a Karman vortex street is an oscillating pattern that emerges when a fluid or gas (in this instance, wind) flows around a suitably-shaped object (in this instance, a topographical feature: the mountain). When they occur on such a large scale, these wind patterns can theoretically generate very-low-frequency sound waves that have been blamed for harmful physiological and psychological symptoms in human beings. According to a 2001 review of the medical literature by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, such symptoms range from annoyance to fatigue to nausea.
Eichar argues that just such a phenomenon may have occurred under extremely high wind conditions on Kholat Syakhl the night of the incident. The resulting bombardment of the skiers by infrasound waves induced severe panic and caused to flee the safety of their tent and meet their deaths.
But never mind the what-ifs entailed in supposing that the wind interacted with the dome of Kholat Syakhl in just such a way as to produce the low-frequency sound effects required, the fact is that acoustic scientists are far from sure that infrasound exposure causes even the mildest symptoms that have been attributed to it, much less extreme panic. 






The Avalanche Hypothesis
We don't pretend to have the solution to the Dyatlov mystery, but some of the facts of the case point to an explanation that doesn't require such a colossal leap of faith.
One thing we do know induces panic in people on a snow-covered mountainside is an avalanche. And while the number of skiers and hikers known to have been killed by infrasound waves to date is zero, avalanches are known to kill approximately 150 skiers, snowmobilers, and snowboarders worldwide every year, according to National Geographic. Moreover, the crushing weight of the four meters of snow under which the last four bodies in the Dyatlov group were found -- possibly deposited there by an avalanche -- could account for their internal injuries.
According to meteorological data compiled by Evgeny Buyanov, temperatures in the vicinity of the skiers' Kholat Syakhl campsite dropped precipitously from minus-11 degrees C to as low as minus-25 degrees C on the night of 1 February 1959. Wind speeds are estimated to have reached between 8 and 16 meters per second, with gusts likely even higher. Without adequate protection, frostbite, hypothermia, and death are virtually guaranteed under such conditions, and within a very short period of time.
Autopsy reports say the proximate cause of death of all but one of the Dyatlov victims, even those who suffered internal trauma, was hypothermia. Did an avalanche occur? We don't know, but one could have, and could account for some unexplained aspects of the incident, including why the skiers fled their tent and why some sustained the kinds of injuries they did.
One may object that an avalanche doesn't explain everything -- the radioactivity found on some of the bodies, for example. Granted. But neither does a Yeti attack, a Karman vortex street, nor, given that we don't even have proof that they were in the vicinity when the skiers met their fate, do unidentified flying balls of fire. 
Update: In January 2021, the avalanche hypothesis garnered scientific support via a study that used computer modeling to simulate the effects of a particular kind of snowslide event called a ""delayed slab avalanche."" The research demonstrated that a small but deadly avalanche could have occurred despite the absence of certain conditions that normally precede such an event, and even explained how the victims could have sustained the some of the strange, atypical injuries that were found.

A caravan of asylum seekers were the focus of a number of fear-mongering rumors and conspiracy theories as they traveled north from Honduras toward the Mexico-United States borderin October 2018. Many of the baseless claims associated with the caravan centered on the idea that the group was violent and posed an immediate threat to American citizens. For example, one image shared on social media purportedly showed members of this caravan dragging a Mexican official through the streets:

As usual, this photograph was not connected to the caravan of asylum seekers traveling toward the United States in October 2018 and originated in a different time and place. This picture was actually taken in November 2014 and related to violent protests in Acapulco, Mexico, over the disappearance of 43 students.
This photograph was shot by Pedro Pardo and is available via Getty Images, where it is posted with the following caption:

Demonstrators hold a riot police during clashes following a protest against the suspected massacre of 43 missing students, near the airport in Acapulco, in the Mexican state of Guerrero State, on November 10, 2014. Protesters angry at the suspected massacre threw stones and a firebomb at riot police in the Pacific resort of Acapulco on Monday, injuring 11 officers. Around 300 students, some wearing masks and armed with sticks and machetes, were joined by some parents of the 43 missing young men as they marched toward the city's airport, but police blocked their way. Mexico was confronted with one of the grisliest massacres in years of drug violence after gang suspects confessed to slaughtering 43 missing students and dumping their charcoaled remains in a river.
A November 2014 news report from The Guardian provides some context to the protests associated with this photograph:

The disappearance of the students had already sparked numerous peaceful demonstrations punctuated by the occasional outbreak of violence.
Tension has intensified, however, since the announcement by attorney general Jesus Murillo that a large group of young people were massacred in a rubbish tip near Iguala a few hours after the students were arrested. He said that the victims were then burned on a huge pyre for 14 hours, making identification of the remains recovered by the authorities very difficult.
The parents have accused the government of trying to close down the case.
Prior to the announcement of the massacre, the authorities had said they recovered at least 38 bodies from nine mass graves near Iguala. Attorney general Murillo said four of these have now been identified as people who disappeared at checkpoints set up by Guerreros Unidos gang members and the municipal police.

This is at least the second time that photographs of injured police officers have been wrongly attached to the caravan of asylum seekers headed toward the United States in October 2018.

In January, the United States marked the anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and President Joe Biden's first year in office, Republicans blocked federal voting rights legislation, and the country experienced a surge of the COVID-19 omicron variant.
Our fact-checking of these topics prompted many of our readers to send us emails and comment on social media, including on our Facebook page. Here is a look at some of the responses, lightly edited for length and clarity. Readers can email us fact-check ideas and feedback at [email protected].
We wrote a story about President Joe Biden's progress on 99 of his campaign promises about COVID-19, racial justice, the economy and climate change, among other things. We rate outcomes on our promise tracker, not intentions. Some readers disagreed with that approach.
""We must remember that the benchmark is, has he TRIED to do these things, not if Congress has passed them, which is completely outside his purview and control,"" a reader said on Facebook. ""We can't blame Biden for Senators Joe Manchin and Krysten Sinema's no votes.""
""One person, President or not, should not get the credit or blame for everything that Congress and the Senate does or doesn't do,"" another reader wrote. ""To focus on just one leader's efforts, successes or failures, is a deeply skewed account of how things get done or don't get done.""
***
Biden said that as a youth, ""I got arrested"" protesting for civil rights. Biden may have participated in one or two flare-ups over racial discrimination in housing that occurred near his home in Delaware when he was in a teenager. But there is no evidence that Biden was actually arrested in the sense of being booked at a police station and facing any consequences in the criminal justice system. We rated his statement False.
A reader commented on Facebook: ""Splitting hairs, much, PolitiFact? Arrested or not, the story illustrates that Joe has always been on the right side of the civil rights issue. That's the real point, isn't it?""
*** 
We wrote a story about Robert Malone, a vaccine scientist who became an anti-vaccine darling. Malone was banned from Twitter for violating the platform's COVID-19 misinformation policies. Malone has billed himself as the ""inventor"" of mRNA vaccines. In reality, the development of the vaccines and the technology they rely on involved countless scientists and several other breakthroughs. Malone has said he got both doses of the Moderna vaccine, although he has also claimed the shots worsened the prolonged symptoms he experienced from a previous COVID-19 infection.
This reader summed up some of the common feedback we heard about our article: 
""Good piece on Dr. Malone. I think the most important takeaway was debunking his claim of being the inventor of mRNA vaccines. As you argued well, the technology is a culmination of work of dozens of scientists, and his claim as *the* inventor is dubious at best."" 
But the reader said other parts of the criticism of Malone seemed more tenuous: ""It's hard to tag him as an anti-vax right winger, and could create some cognitive dissonance and muddle your message.""
Another reader asked why we didn't mention the usage of monoclonal antibodies as a treatment for COVID-19. ""I personally am vaccinated, but would like to hear your perspective on monoclonal antibodies. It seems bizarre that his solution to the problem is entirely left out of your article. Why are we not talking about monoclonal antibodies and their efficacy when used in conjunction with other medication?""
*** 
We wrote a story on same-day voter registration, which is offered to voters in 20 states. Democrats wrote legislation to require all states to offer it, but that was rejected by Republicans. A reader said we should have included more perspective from Republicans:
""In your well-written article, I only found one small paragraph giving perspective on why one conservative group (not even specifically Republicans) actually oppose it. In honor of MLK Day, I shared an article with my coworkers describing how MLK's principles were deeply influenced by the work of Mohandas Gandhi. One of these principles was non-violence seeks to win the 'friendship and understanding' of the opponent, not to humiliate him. I hope this new year provides more opportunities for understanding and friendship between people simply having somewhat different values and priorities (see Jonathan Haidt's moral foundations theory and his TED Talk).""

PolitiFact and other International Fact-Checking Network fact-checkers in January wrote a letter to YouTube asking that it step up efforts to combat online disinformation and misinformation worldwide.
""It's just plain common sense that you can't rely on YouTube, Facebook or Twitter to provide unbiased information,"" one reader wrote. ""All three of those platforms are like the 'wild west' just by the false narratives they foster. I am of the opinion that the internet is a definite form of communication and it should fall under the Federal Communications Commission for some kind of regulation.""

PolitiFact Wisconsin put Sen. Ron Johnson on our Flip-O-Meter after he announced he would seek re-election. In 2016, Johnson was unequivocal: that term, his second, would be his last.

Some readers questioned why we took Johnson to task. ""So what! He changed his mind! So what!"" Another reader replied to that comment: ""  It matters because he lied.""

We fact-checked a statement by Trump that Democrats ""are trying to ban voter ID."" His spokesperson cited a Democratic bill in 2020 that would have eased voter ID requirements. That bill was not enacted. Democrats have proposed various bills that would include a work around for voters who lack ID or a long list of acceptable forms of IDs. We rated Trump's statement Mostly False. We heard a mixture of reactions from readers:
""Clearly, Democrats are seeking on a federal level to interfere with states' voter ID laws. Requiring a state to accept utility bills would ban that state from requiring actual identification. Trump's statement is Mostly True.""
""Get out of left field and get into center field. Trump said they were TRYING to take away voter ID in states that have it."" The left is trying to take away voter ID, the reader wrote. 
""Dems would end voter ID if they could. They know that the majority of Americans want voter ID so instead they'll try to pass a watered down version of voter ID.""
""One of the major problems for the United States is the loss of voices and intimidation of moderates by right and left extremists. There is no value to me in saying that a specific statement by Trump is wrong/greatly exaggerated - duh! Moderates want a thoughtful, moderate discussion of voter ID."" 
***
We fact-checked a billboard by the Hillsborough County, Florida, GOP that refers to U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, a Democrat, as a communist. The group's chair told the Tampa Bay Times that it used the label because Castor is a ""the leading proponent for the Green New Deal."" That's wrong on many levels. We rated the billboard Pants on Fire!
A reader sent us an email: ""Thank you for your article dispelling the despicable billboard labeling Congresswoman Castor a communist. I speak as a Reagan Republican when I tell you that the current leadership of our party within Hillsborough County is typical of who and what is ruining my beloved GOP: conspiracy theorists and far-right extremists who have no clue and no respect. They are our equivalent of the far-left progressives who are attempting to hijack the Democratic Party. I may not always agree with the Congresswoman, but I happen to know her on a personal level, and she is a fine individual with love for her family and friends and for her country.""

In December, PolitiFact awarded the annual Lie of the Year to lies about the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. A retired librarian sent us an email with congratulations because our coverage was included in the Library of Congress historical collection of internet materials related to the attack.

157.Anauditofthe2020electioninMaricopaCountyArizisconfirmingtherumorsthatrealballotshaveaspecialwatermark,"
Nearly six months after Joe Biden defeated former President Donald Trump, contractors hired by Arizona Senate Republicans are auditing results in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix and the state Capitol, where some Republicans have made allegations of widespread voter fraud.
These claims have been dismissed in court and refuted by a sampled hand count of ballots. Maricopa also hired two independent firms to conduct a forensic audit of its tabulation equipment. The audit found no abnormalities.
But a new spin on an old conspiracy theory has emerged during the recount. It builds on a debunked narrative that Trump's administration put secret watermarks on official ballots to trick cheating Democrats. (Pants on Fire!)
The new version makes allusions to ultraviolet light and an acronym for president that refers to Trump.
""Auditors are now using UV light to scan across all ballots. POTUS told us the 2020 election would be stolen via fake printed ballots. We were right about specially marker ballots all along, the media and left called us all crazy, but we knew,"" says a post widely shared on Facebook. ""The Maricopa audit is confirming the rumors, that real ballots have a special watermark. No wonder the Democrats tried to stall... NCSWIC.""
NCSWIC, for ""Nothing Can Stop What Is Coming,"" is used by adherents of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory.
With the Facebook post is a photo of three people at machines. The letter Q is above the photo along with this headline: ""WATCH THE WATER."" 
The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The Maricopa County Elections Department confirmed a previous statement that it does not use watermarks or any other ""secret markings"" on its ballots. And no evidence has emerged that the contractors have found any evidence of watermarks.
Ken Bennett, the state Senate Republicans' liaison for the audit, told PolitiFact that auditors did initially scan ballots with UV lights to see if there were watermarks. But they are no longer using UV lights, Bennett told PolitiFact on May 3. We told Bennett that Facebook posts state that the audit had confirmed rumors about ballots having a special watermark.

""There is no evidence of that and findings would not be released in the middle of the audit anyway, that is pure speculation or made up whatever,"" said Bennett, a former Arizona secretary of state.
QAnon and water
QAnon emerged in October 2017 and is rooted in the unsubstantiated belief that an array of public figures are Satan-worshipping, cannibalistic pedophiles and Trump was in charge of a covert effort to arrest and expose them. Facebook has banned QAnon pages, groups and accounts since October, but posts such as these continue to proliferate.
The ""watch the water"" comment comes from a February 2018 QAnon thread, known as a ""Q drop,"" which are cryptic messages that the central figure of the conspiracy theory posts for followers to decipher. The watermark claim around election day that we fact-checked tried to connect watermarks with ""watch the water,"" as the new claims appears to do. 
Allegations in Arizona
Republicans in November started to raise challenges to the presidential election in Arizona, centering largely on Maricopa County, after Biden narrowly won the state following Trump's win there in 2016. In March, Senate Republicans announced that they had hired a team, led by a Florida-based technology company called Cyber Ninjas, to conduct the audit.
Cyber Ninjas doesn't appear to have previous experience in election audits. The firm is led by Doug Logan, who was part of the ""stop the steal"" conspiracy theories about the election.
A voice mail message left for Logan was not returned.
The outcome of the audit will have no impact on the 2020 election results, which were certified by state officials in November. On Jan. 6, Congress voted to accept those results showing that Biden won Arizona and the presidency.
Our ruling
A Facebook post claims that an audit of the 2020 election in Maricopa County, Ariz., ""is confirming the rumors that real ballots have a special watermark"" -- suggesting that fake ballots could have been cast in an effort to prevent Trump from being re-elected president.
Maricopa County says it does not use watermarks on its ballots.  No evidence has emerged that the audit, led by a firm headed up by a man who was part of the ""stop the steal"" conspiracy theories about the election, has found any evidence of watermarks.
We rate the post False.

231.FakeArticleAboutEliz,"
On 29 February 2016, a fake New York Times story caused a stir when it appeared to show that Senator Elizabeth Warren had endorsed Bernie Sanders for President.  The article -- which used the same layout and typeface as the actual outlet -- claimed that Sanders had also received the endorsements of Senator Barbara Boxer and actress Lena Dunham. It was convincing enough that thousands shared the piece on social media before it was taken down:


WOW this is significant. maybe a game changer.
Posted by Jennifer Abod on Tuesday, March 1, 2016


The fake article was apparently created with Clone Zone, which exists specifically so that users can spoof well-known web sites (with links that appear similar at first glance to those pages). Popular spoofs include other fake New York Times articles with Onion-style headlines (""President Obama Imagines Seinfeld Today,"" ""Man Receives Identical Plaid Shirt For Birthday"") but none that received the level of attention so fast as the Bernie Sanders endorsement.
The New York Times quickly issued a statement about the clone page:
""An article circulating on social media tonight that is made to resemble a New York Times story and says Elizabeth Warren endorsed Bernie Sanders is a fake and has no connection to The Times,"" said Matthew Purdy, a deputy executive editor of The Times.
Ms. Warren has yet to endorse a presidential candidate.
The article appeared to have been created around midday Monday on Clone Zone, a website that allows users to make website ""clones"" in the guise of well-established sites.
As of Monday night, the fake article had been viewed more than 50,000 times, with 15,000 shares on Facebook, Clone Zone said.
Many readers appeared to be taken in. 






The link to the fake story is still up, but clicking on it brought up the following message:

According to the New York Times, the domain www.nytimes.com has now been blocked from being cloned.
Rumors and conspiracy theories flew through the political sphere faster than the original article, with wonks and pundits offering up their own speculation about which politician's camp created it, and what they hoped to accomplish by doing so while eliding the most likely explanation: that (like so many things on the internet) a random person created the spoof page because they thought it might be amusing.
No matter who was behind it, the fake article should impart a valuable lesson about the internet: always check your sources.

As news networks report on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, one particular video clip prompted conspiracy claims about the authenticity of the reports.
Social media users on Facebook questioned if a shot up car was really in Ukraine, pointing to video that showed it had a window decal that looked like a West Virginia inspection sticker.
""I don't care what side you are on, because it is happening on both sides. This is why America has no trust in the media. A West Virginia inspection sticker on an Uber in 'Ukraine'"", said a March 13 Facebook post.
""How did a car from WV end up in Ukraine on NBC News,"" another post said.
The posts were flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
Captain R.A. Maddy of the West Virginia State Police confirmed that the sticker was an inspection decal that expired in September 2021. But that doesn't mean that the car itself wasn't in Ukraine. Here's the evidence.
The origins of the video
The video of the car can be traced back to a March 13 NBC Nightly News report about the shooting of journalist and documentary filmmaker Brent Renaud, who was in Ukraine with colleague Juan Arrendondo to cover the war. As the report described the danger in Ukraine, it showed several vehicles that had been burned or shot up, including the car in question. The report gave a larger picture of the vehicle, showing that it was an Uber vehicle with what appeared to be Ukrainian text along the side. 


Top: Screenshot of vehicle from a March 14, 2022 Fox News report. Bottom: A screenshot of a Facebook user's claim. While news reports showed the full side of the car, which had an Uber logo and what appears to be Ukrainian print, the Facebook posts only provided a view of the car's decal sticker. 
 
It's not clear if the car in the Facebook posts was the one that Renaud and Arrendondo were attacked in. We reached out to Uber, but did not receive a response.

The Pentagon ""finally comes clean"" and ""admits...that there are 46 U.S. military-funded biolabs in Ukraine""












By Samantha Putterman * June 15, 2022







An NBC spokesperson verified that the video was indeed real, and that it was licensed from Reuters. A spokesperson at Reuters confirmed that the video was taken in Irpin, Ukraine, which is right next to Kyiv, Ukraine's capital.
NBC has since taken down their report, due to fair usage rights. ""We shared the video during the allotted time period that is customary for some fair usage videos,"" the NBC spokesperson said. 
Other news sites, including Fox News, have also aired the clip with the Uber car.
It's feasible for the car to have been moved from the U.S. to Ukraine, said Robin Grove, CEO of Classic Automotive Relocation Services (CARS) USA, a company that ships classic and high-end vehicles across the globe. 
""U.S. rules and laws are that U.S. cars with titles may be exported as long as they are not stolen,"" Grove said, pointing to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's rules on exporting a motor vehicle. ""They are allowed to ship to any country that is not on the sanction list as long as governmental protocols are adhered to.""
Ukraine doesn't fall on that list of sanctions, so it's possible for a vehicle to have been shipped there. 
The United Nations reported in an October 2020 study that between 2015-2018, the U.S. ""exported a significant number of used vehicles to Europe, specifically Eastern Europe."" In 2018, the U.S. shipped 34,871 cars to Ukraine. 
Our ruling
A Facebook post claimed that ""a West Virginia inspection sticker on an Uber"" proves the car was not in Ukraine.
A West Virginia State Police Captain confirmed that the decal on the car was an expired sticker from the state. However, this doesn't mean that the car wasn't in Ukraine -- a spokesperson for Reuters, which owns the video, confirmed that the video was filmed there. 
It's not uncommon for cars to be exported from the U.S. to other countries, including Ukraine.

55.IsBeyoncéanItalianWo,"
On July 4, 2020, Florida congressional candidate KW Miller took to Twitter with a mind-blowing (if true) revelation: Famous music artist Beyonce is ""not even African American."" Rather, Miller wrote, she was an Italian woman named Ann Marie Lastrassi:

This wasn't the first ridiculous rumor Miller promoted. A self-described conservative, Miller appears to use Twitter trolling and promoting conspiracy theories as a tactic to attract attention to his congressional campaign.
Before we look at the origins of this bizarre theory, let's take a glance at Beyonce's family tree.
Beyonce was born to Black parents, Tina and Mathew Knowles, in September 1981. Beyond that, her ancestry can be traced back to her great-great-great-grandmother, Rosalie Jean Louis, a slave who was born in Louisiana in 1800, and Joseph Lacey, a wealthy white merchant and Louis' reported slave owner.  






In 2018, Beyonce revealed to Vogue that she was the descendant of a slave and a slave owner (emphasis ours):
I come from a lineage of broken male-female relationships, abuse of power, and mistrust. Only when I saw that clearly was I able to resolve those conflicts in my own relationship. Connecting to the past and knowing our history makes us both bruised and beautiful.
I researched my ancestry recently and learned that I come from a slave owner who fell in love with and married a slave. I had to process that revelation over time. I questioned what it meant and tried to put it into perspective. I now believe it's why God blessed me with my twins. Male and female energy was able to coexist and grow in my blood for the first time. I pray that I am able to break the generational curses in my family and that my children will have less complicated lives.
Beyonce's true ancestry aside, Miller's claim doesn't make sense from a logical standpoint.
Beyonce has been in the public eye for more than two decades. So what's more believable? That philanthropist George Soros found an Italian singer, changed her name, brought her to America, found two Black people to pretend to be her parents, found her a spot in the musical group Destiny's Child, waited for her to become a successful solo artist, and then, after more than 20 years of deceitful patience, got her to insert subliminal messaging into her songs about a New World Order? Or, that Beyonce is a successful Black woman with a voice all her own?
Regardless, the idea that Beyonce is actually an Italian woman named Ann Marie Lastrassi is not supported by any evidence.
In fact, this rumor was popularized by a tongue-in-cheek Twitter thread mocking a single comment in an Instagram post. In June 2020, the Instagram account Lawlessbey posted two photographs of Beyonce along with a compliment about how the singer still looked youthful. An Instagram user then commented on this post that Beyonce was actually an Italian woman:
This single comment (since deleted) appears to be the basis of this rumor. This comment was not accompanied by any evidence to support this claim, and this news has not been reported or corroborated by any credible source. In fact, we weren't able to find any sources (credible or otherwise) making this claim prior to JJwwebb's post. 
On June 22, the @Barcarvs Twitter account popularized this theory in a joke thread mocking the conspiracy theory:

It should be noted that the hashtags at the bottom of Miller's tweet relate to the ""QAnon"" or ""Q"" movement, built on an unwieldy, nonsensical, ever-evolving collection of unfounded rumors that, more or less, claim that a ""deep state"" cabal of Satan-worshiping, cannibalistic pedophiles is working to undermine U.S. President Donald Trump. This movement came to prominence in part thanks to the debunked ""Pizzagate"" conspiracy theory and has spawned dozens of offshoot theories. For instance, some proponents of Q believe COVID-19 coronavirus disease is spreading via 5G towers (false). Although these conspiracy theories are outlandish at best, QAnon references have started to pop up in the feeds of some opportunistic politicians.
One of the apparent problems with QAnon is that it revolves around rumors of uncertain origin that often touch on barely believable topics. This makes it difficult (as seen above) to tell the difference between jokes that mock Q-like conspiracy theories and posts that actually attempt to further these ideas in earnest.

158.WhoisGeorgeKent,"
This article was updated Nov. 14.
George Kent's extensive background as a career diplomat, his specialist in Ukrainian and Russian issues, and his expertise in anti-corruption work made him a closely watched witness in the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump.
Kent is one of the most high-ranking career officials who had knowledge about elements of the alleged White House effort to get Ukrainian officials to provide information damaging to former Vice President Joe Biden.
House Democrats called Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, to give public testimony Nov. 13, one of two witnesses called during the first day of public hearings. 
His testimony buttressed the Democratic perspective that individuals aligned with Trump ran an alternative foreign policy in Ukraine that went around career diplomats. He also threw cold water on a conspiracy theory advocated by some Trump allies that Ukraine, rather than Russia, interfered in the 2016 presidential election.
It was ""amply clear that Russian interference was at the heart"" of the 2016 campaign meddling, Kent said.
Kent also said that Biden's efforts to fight corruption in Ukraine were legitimate and not a cover to protect the company his son worked for.
Here's a snapshot of his background as well as highlights from the testimony he provided in public and behind closed doors.

Who is George Kent?
Kent is a career foreign-service officer who has served under presidents of both parties. 
In his current post, Kent oversees State Department policy towards Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
From 2015 to 2018, Kent served as deputy chief of mission in Kiev, Ukraine. Previously, he served as the senior anti-corruption coordinator in the State Department's European Bureau. From 2012 to 2014, he directed the State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement.
His earlier foreign service postings have included Warsaw; Kiev; Tashkent, Uzbekistan; and Bangkok.
Highlights from his public testimony
Kent, wearing a much-commented-upon bow tie, generally bolstered the concerns expressed by Democrats.
Asked about the notion backed by some Trump allies that Ukraine -- rather than Russia -- interfered in the 2016 election, Kent gave a firm no.
""To my knowledge, there is no factual basis, no,"" he said of the Ukrainian interference theory, adding, ""I think it's amply clear that Russian interference was at the heart of the interference in the 2016 election cycle.""
He also rejected the argument articulated by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., that there was no difference between Joe Biden strong-arming Ukraine into firing prosecutor Viktor Shokin and Trump's attempt to press Ukraine into providing dirt on Biden, a potential 2020 opponent, and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma.
""I do not think they are the same things,"" Kent said. ""What former Vice President Biden requested of the president of Ukraine Poroshenko is the removal of a corrupt prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, who had undermined a system of criminal investigation that we built with American money to build corruption cases."" (We rated Paul's comparison False.)
Kent also criticized a campaign of Trump allies to oust U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.
He said it was ""unexpected, and most unfortunate ... to watch some Americans, including those who aligned themselves with corrupt Ukrainians in pursuit of private agendas, launch attacks on dedicated public servants advancing U.S. interests in Ukraine.""
Yovanovitch, he added, ""was dedicated, as is every U.S. government official in Ukraine, to help Ukrainians overcome the legacy of corruption.""
And while Kent said that he was concerned about the appearance of a conflict of interest with the younger Biden's hiring by Burisma, he made clear that the vice president, in his view, did nothing improper.
""I did not witness any efforts by any U.S. official to shield Burisma from scrutiny,"" Kent said. ""In fact, I and other U.S. officials consistently advocated reinstituting a scuttled investigation of Zlochevsky, Burisma's founder, as well as holding the corrupt prosecutors who closed the case to account.""
Highlights from his closed-door testimony
Kent testified to sharing information with officials uneasy with Trump's effort to get Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, including Ambassador William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine who testified the same day as Kent, and Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a Ukraine expert at the National Security Council.
Here are some of the most widely noted passages in the transcript of Kent's testimony before the House Intelligence Committee on Oct. 15, 2019.
* Page 268: Kent testified about a conversation he'd been told about that involved Trump and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union and a Trump donor. The conversation allegedly involved what Trump wanted to hear from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky regarding the Biden family and their activities in Ukraine.
Kent: ""POTUS in sort of shorthand ... wanted nothing less than President Zelensky to go to (the) microphone and say 'investigations,' 'Biden,' and 'Clinton.'""
Question from House staffer: ""And in return for what?""
Kent: ""That was not clear to me. I wasn't part of this exchange. But Bill Taylor then followed up with a videoconference, our normal Monday call in which he elaborated on his conversations. ...""
* Page 131: Kent also testified that Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer and a key figure in the Ukraine efforts, had carried out a campaign to oust then-Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who they allegedly saw as an impediment to their activities.
Kent: Giuliani ""had been carrying on a campaign for several months, full of lies and incorrect information about Ambassador Yovanovitch. ... His assertions and allegations against former Ambasador Yovanovitch were without basis -- untrue, period.""
* Page 258: Kent testified to his impressions about which officials were involved in a separate diplomatic effort with Ukraine. 
Kent: ""It was clear to me that Ambassador Sondland had a direct connection with Chief of Staff (Mick) MuIvaney, and that's actually how the May 23 readout was put on the president's schedule. It was not, to the best of my knowledge, done through the national security staff and Ambassador (John) Bolton (the national security adviser). It was ... Ambassador Sondland directly to Chief of Staff  Mulvaney.""
* Page 47: Kent testified about an effort by some of Trump's allies to secure a visa for former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin to come to the United States. Shokin is the prosecutor whose firing was urged by Biden on behalf of the U.S. government, a position that was in tune with that of other Western leaders. 
Question: ""What was the State Department's view about the propriety of a visa for Mr. Shokin?""
Kent: ""Mr. Shokin, as I mentioned, was well and very unfavorably known to us. And we felt, under no circumstances, should a visa be issued to someone who knowingly subverted and wasted U.S. taxpayer money. And as somebody who had a fiduciary responsibility for anti-corruption programs, I felt personally strongly. ...""
Question: ""What did you learn (about) why Mr. Giuliani was pushing to have a visa granted?""
Kent: ""To the best of my recollection, the story that he conveyed to my colleagues in Consular Affairs was that Shokin wanted to come to the United States to share information suggesting that there was corruption at the U.S. Embassy.""
Question: ""And did you understand what he was referring to?""
Kent: ""Knowing Mr. Shokin, I had full faith that it was (a) bunch of hooey, and he was looking to basically engage in a con game out of revenge, because he'd lost his job.""
* Page 102: A few elements of Kent's testimony could be helpful in supporting Republican talking points. For instance, he expressed a negative impression of Burisma, the energy company that hired Hunter Biden for its board.
Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio: ""Mr. Secretary, you said you didn't know for sure if Shokin was investigating Burisma, but you knew Burisma was a troubled, corrupt company, right?""
Kent: ""As I said, Burisma had a reputation for being, first of all, one of the largest private producers of natural gas in Ukraine, but also had a reputation for not being the sort of corporate, cleanest member of the business community.""
Jordan: ""And you were so concerned about that that you advised (the U.S. Agency for International Development) not to do any type of coordinated activity (with them).""
Kent: ""Correct.""
* Page 226: Another piece of Kent's testimony that could help Republicans is his expressing concern that Hunter Biden's position with Burisma could pose an appearance of a conflict of interest, (We have addressed this issue here.)
Kent: ""And when I was on a call with somebody on the vice president's staff -- and I cannot recaIl who it was -- just briefing on what was happening (on) Ukraine, I raised my concerns that I had heard that Hunter Biden was on the board of a company owned by somebody that the U.S. government had spent money trying to get tens of millions of dollars back (from), and that could create the perception of a conflict of interest.""
Question: ""And what did the person on the other end of the line tell you?""
Kent: ""The message that I recall hearing back was that the vice president's son, Beau, was dying of cancer and that there was no further bandwidth to deal with family-related issues at that time.""
Question: ""Was that pretty much the end of it?""
Kent: ""That was the end of that conversation.""

173.SchoolShootingSpawns,"



5.1K1The internet has been rife with rumors about the school shooting that left 17 dead in Florida on Feb. 14. We've debunked several of them.
Initially, the rumors focused on the alleged shooter himself, Nikolas Cruz. But, as students who survived the shooting started advocating stricter gun controls, new rumors focused on the most vocal among them. Those falsehoods grew into full-fledged conspiracy theories, one of which briefly topped the list of trending videos on YouTube.
That one claimed that David Hogg, a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, was actually a ""crisis actor."" Similar theories claiming that many of the teens are ""crisis actors"" popped up on Facebook along with claims that they are part of a ""deep state"" conspiracy involving CNN and the FBI. These rumors got extra exposure when they were highlighted by public figures and amplified on social media with the help of Russian bots.
There also was a rumor that Hogg graduated in 2015 from Redondo Shores Continuation High School, which is for at-risk students, in California. That rumor, which appears to have originated on a hoax Twitter account, purported to show his yearbook photo from Redondo Shores.
The fact is Hogg is a student at Stoneman Douglas High School. He's a member of the school's television news show and was pictured in the Sun-Sentinel newspaper in 2015 running in a cross-country race for Stoneman Douglas.
For more, see our Feb. 22 story, ""No 'Crisis Actors' in Parkland, Florida,"" and our Feb. 25 item, ""Phony Yearbook Photo.""
Another rumor, one of the first to show up online, claimed that Cruz is a registered Democrat.
He is not. According to records from the Florida Department of State, he is not a registered voter.
That claim originated on a conservative website called Gateway Pundit with the headline: ""BREAKING: Don't Let The MAGA Hat Fool You, Hispanic Shooter 'Nicolas de Jesus Cruz' Was A Registered Democrat.""
Although that site later changed its headline to say that Cruz was not, in fact, a registered Democrat, it was too late. Other websites had already copied the inaccurate version and promoted it on Facebook, contributing to an unsupported narrative that mass shooters are often Democrats. rep. Claudia Tenney of New York later continued spreading that narrative, telling a radio show host: ""It's interesting that so many of these people that commit the mass murders end up being Democrats. But the media doesn't talk about that.""
She offered no support for her statement.
For more on the claim about Cruz, see our Feb. 20 story ""Florida Shooter Not Registered Dem.""
Another early rumor with a political bent claimed that former First Lady Michelle Obama had blamed President Donald Trump for the shooting.
She didn't. At the time that claim was made - based on a fabricated quote - the only statement she had made publicly was a retweet from Barack Obama's account expressing grief.
She has since tweeted about her support for the students who are advocating changes to gun laws. Still no mention of Trump.

9.AreTheseWrongNumberT,"
In March 2022, screenshots supposedly showing text messages from a redheaded woman were circulated on social media attached to the claim that these messages were related to a sex trafficking ring. Posts on social media also warned that if people responded to these messages the sender would be able to track their location.
Here's a text from one post that has racked up more than 30,000 shares:
!!SEX TRAFFICKING WARNING!!there is a sex trafficking text going around a couple states close by. it's a pic of a red headed girl acting like she's trying to get a hold of a guy she went on a date with, then if you reply to her being nice simply saying ""you have the wrong number."" they can track your location. i got a text friday and didn't think anything about and thought it was just a joke or something and she sent me a nude and then messages that i could tell were already pre written out and then i deleted the texts. and i opened facebook just a little bit ago and seen a post of people having similar issues with the same picture. these people are changing their area code and using different phone number based off of where you live. they used 336 for mine, and 865 on a lady fromtennessee. i turned off all of my locations on all of my apps. PLEASE DO NOT TEXT THIS NUMBER BACK. there is also a blonde headed girl going around doing the same and it's believed to be sex trafficking scam!!
!!*update* they are changing the area code based off of the area code affiliated with your phone number !!
A viral TikTok video about a slightly different version of this rumor received more than 2.7 million views on TikTok.
 






Similar versions of this rumor featuring photographs of different women have been circulating for years. You can see some visual examples of the various versions of this rumor at the top of this article. 
While people were truly receiving text messages purporting to be from a redheaded woman who dialed the wrong number, and while recipients truly are best off ignoring, blocking, and deleting these messages, there's no evidence that these messages are connected to a sex trafficking ring, nor is there any indication that a person's location will be tracked if they engage with this message. 
These text messages are just the latest iteration in a series of fear-mongering rumors about sex trafficking that have been circulating on social media for years. While sex trafficking is certainly a real world problem, many of the rumors that get passed around social media about the various tactics sex traffickers are supposedly using to find victims are unfounded. We've previously encountered false rumors about sex traffickers leaving chemically tainted roses on cars, putting zip-ties on mailboxes to mark the location of victims, and posing as door-to-door booksellers.
Ron Pierce, president of the IT company Trinity Solutions, told the North Carolina CBS news affiliate WFMY:
""It's a spam text message ... It's kind of one of those social myths, it gets circulated every now and then. This one has been going around since at least 2020, and maybe even a little before. Then it used to be just the whole sex trafficking angle, but now it's, 'watch out, they could track you.' It's a lie, they can't track you by responding to the text or clicking anything like that.""
While there's no evidence that the person(s) sending these text messages are linked to a sex trafficking ring, they are likely engaged in another nefarious activity: theft. 
The goal of many spam text messages is to get a person to divulge personal information, such as a credit card number, birth date, or personal photos, or to click on links containing malware that can steal this information. In the case above, it appears that the scammer was using flirty text messages (and eventually nude photos) in order to get people to click on a link to an adult website that was likely infested with malware.
While these text messages are not linked to sex-trafficking, and receiving one will not allow anyone to track your location, if you get one of these text messages, your best option is to ignore, delete, and mark the number as spam. 
It's also worth mentioning that while the people on social media warning others about a new sex trafficking scheme are probably doing so with good intentions, these warnings can distract from real sex-trafficking issues and divert resources from people who truly need help. In 2020, after a conspiracy theory that the furniture store Wayfair was trafficking children in overpriced cabinets went viral, the Polaris Project, a nonprofit nongovernmental organization working to combat sex trafficking, published an article explaining how these conspiratorial rumors can impact survivors and victims:
A barrage of conspiracy-related reports from people with no direct knowledge of trafficking situations can overwhelm services meant for victims.
There are only so many Hotline Advocates available at any one time to handle incoming contacts to the Trafficking Hotline. Hundreds or thousands of people sharing the same information means long wait times for victims in crisis or service providers trying to find immediate help for someone in need. These long waits may literally mean the difference between someone finding the help they need to escape or having to hang up because they can't get through.
Survivors, victims, or even accidental bystanders may lose their privacy or be negatively impacted.
The Wayfair theory has already resulted in online harassment and privacy intrusions of people mistakenly believed to be victims, as well as broad sharing of online sexual abuse material of actual victims who have not been connected in any way to Wayfair. This harm is real for survivors who want to maintain their privacy, victims who are being re-exploited by broader distribution of their abuse materials, or bystanders whose lives can be overwhelmed by the actions of potentially well-meaning online communities.

79.MicrosoftandBillGatescreateda1999videogamecalledOmikron,"
Ever since it was discovered, people have continued to use the new COVID-19 omicron variant to make false claims about the pandemic. Some claimed its name was evidence that the whole thing was planned, while others spread a photoshopped poster for a non-existent film called ""The Omicron Variant."" 
Now, social media posts claim that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates created a video game named -- you guessed it -- ""Omikron"" back in 1999.
""DID YOU KNOW?"" text on a Facebook post graphic asks. ""Omikron was the name of a 1999 video game by Microsoft and Bill Gates about demons pretending to be humans and harvesting their souls."" One video circulating online fuels conspiracy theories further as it shows the game's anti-government plot featuring a digitally illustrated David Bowie-like character. 
The game is real and was available to play on Microsoft Windows computers in November 1999, but it wasn't developed by Microsoft or Gates. 
The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
""Omikron: The Nomad Soul"" was created by Quantic Dream, a French developer based in Paris founded by a man named David Cage. Bowie made the music for the game, and the game features a character who shares Bowie's voice and appearance.
It was released on Sega's home video game console Dreamcast in 2000, and it's still available today on Steam, a video game digital distribution service.

According to International Olympic Committee data, ""an average of 29 athletes under the age of 35 suffered sudden death per year from 1966 to 2004. From March 2021 to March 2022, 769 athletes have died or suffered cardiac arrest.""












By Samantha Putterman * June 23, 2022







The adventure game follows players as their souls enter the futuristic city of Omikron, located in an alternate dimension. Players explore the world while fighting off demons who try to trap their souls.
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation told PolitiFact that the claims about Gates and the game are false, and a Microsoft spokesperson confirmed that neither the company nor Gates developed the game. 
Meanwhile, the new coronavirus variant's name of omicron follows an established pattern of naming variants after letters in the Greek alphabet. The first four variants of concern identified by the World Health Organization --  alpha, beta, gamma and delta -- are all Greek letters.
""These labels were chosen after wide consultation and review of many potential naming systems,"" the WHO said when it announced it would use the Greek alphabet to name variants. The organization said it convened ""an expert group of partners from around the world to do so, including experts who are part of existing naming systems, nomenclature and virus taxonomic experts, researchers and national authorities."" 
It's not unreasonable to see why writers would pick the word omicron for futuristic popular culture references as it's been used by astronomers for years to name multiple stars, like Omicron Persei and Omicron Centauri. The aliens in the animated show ""Futurama,"" for example, are from a planet called Omicron Persei 8. 
Our ruling
Social media posts claim Microsoft and Bill Gates created a 1999 video game called ""Omikron.""
This is wrong. A real game called Omikron was available on Microsoft in 1999, but neither Gates nor Microsoft created it, and it had nothing to do with the COVID-19 pandemic, as these posts suggest. The term omicron is from the Greek alphabet, which has been used by health officials to name coronavirus variants. The word has also been used to name stars and appears in multiple popular culture references.

80.DidaWomanAdmitSheWas,"
In April 2018, American comedian and actor Bill Cosby was convicted of felony sexual assault on a woman who had accused him of drugging and sexually abusing her years before (one of dozens who made similar allegations). Cosby was sentenced to three to 10 years in a state prison and is currently serving time. He has consistently denied the accusations.
The case became the subject of viral conjecture in late February 2019, when social media users shared an article published by the South African website Abesiki Bebunda Newspaper headlined ""Woman Admits She Was Paid to Frame Cosby with Rape.""
The article, credited to ""Baxter Dmitry,"" didn't actually cite any of Cosby's accusers. Instead, it recited an elaborate conspiracy theory, attributed to a so-called ""Hollywood insider,"" that multiple accusers were paid to frame the actor:
It is a crime to be black, successful and rich. A Hollywood insider has come forward alleging that Bill Cosby was framed with rape allegations in order to prevent him from buying TV network NBC ...
Cosby, known as ""America's Dad"", is standing trial for aggravated sexual assault in Pittsburgh, and has responded to allegations that he drugged and sexually abused women with fierce denials.
The Hollywood insider says that Bill Cosby became such a threat to the establishment elite that they had to invent the vilest of accusations against him in order to destroy his career.
The accusers are women who have worked with the Illuminati in the past and were paid to state they are victims of rape. Only one of Cosby's accusers leveled accusations against him within the statute of limitations (twelve years), and the others, according to the Hollywood insider, are opportunists who have been paid off to smear Cosby's reputation and destroy his career.
The supposed ""insider"" was not named in the article. Moreover, despite being published in 2019, the content appeared outdated, stating, for example, that Cosby ""is standing trial for aggravated sexual assault in Pittsburgh."" 






In the process of trying to corroborate the text, we discovered it had been published several times before by assorted junk news websites, including News Punch (14 June 2017 and 3 August 2016), Your News Wire (3 August 2016), SplenGroup (29 January 2016), and a fake TMZ website using the now-defunct domain name TMZNewsOnline.net (on or about 26 January 2016).
We had occasion to debunk a previous hoax story by TMZNewsOnline.net in July 2016, when the website falsely claimed that pro wrestler John Cena had died in a car crash. Your News Wire published dozens of questionable items that came across our transom between 2015 and 2018, after which it continued publishing the same false and misleading, conspiracy-tinged content under the name News Punch.
Even ignoring its sordid provenance, the article is utterly lacking in credibility. The vaunted ""Hollywood insider"" who supposedly provided the information was not named. The group alleged to be behind the plot to frame Cosby, a secret society of elites called the ""Illuminati,"" is a standard (and long discredited) trope resorted to by conspiracy theorists who have no evidence to support their claims.
It is true that Bill Cosby was once reportedly interested in buying NBC from then-owner General Electric in the early 1990s (in fact, a sentence in the junk news article was copied and pasted verbatim from a New York Times report on the nascent Cosby/NBC deal published in 1992), but that was more than a decade before the first sexual assault allegation came to light. (The notion that an effort by Hollywood elites to frame Cosby was prompted by his attempt to purchase the network was first promulgated by the late comedian and noted conspiracy theorist Dick Gregory in 2015.)
The supposed ""testimony"" of an anonymous person who claimed to be a former Wilhelmina model and said she was paid $15,000 to ""seduce and destroy Bill Cosby"" was published on a website in 2014. That website, which claimed it had ""fact checked and verified"" the statement, no longer exists. We encountered no other evidence to support the claims.

98.DidaPlannedCongressi,"
In January 2019, in the midst of the longest-ever federal government shutdown, President Donald Trump and Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi became embroiled in a high-profile dispute. 
On 16 January, Pelosi wrote to Trump suggesting that the president postpone his State of the Union address on the grounds that it was a designated ""National Special Security Event,"" and the U.S. Secret Service had by then not been funded for 26 days. 
A day later, President Trump responded, informing Pelosi that he was postponing a planned congressional delegation trip to visit American troops in Belgium, Egypt and Afghanistan -- an excursion Pelosi had carefully planned and intended to lead, in the company of several other members of the U.S. Congress. Trump wrote:
""In light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I am sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate. I also feel that, during this period, it would be better if you were in Washington negotiating with me and joining the strong border security movement to end the shutdown.""
Although the congressional delegation could use commercial flights rather than U.S. military aircraft, Pelosi cancelled the excursion, claiming that President Trump's public announcement of the until-then secret plans had created an insurmountable security risk for the delegation.  






Against this background, a rumor emerged online that attempted to discredit and undermine the motives and activities of Pelosi, who has been a frequent target of junk news and misinformation.
On 19 January, the ""Marshall Report,"" a blog that specializes in junk news and right-leaning conspiracy theories, claimed the group that had intended to visit Belgium, Egypt and Afghanistan included dozens of Pelosi's own family members.
The blog post carried the headline ""Pelosi's secret overseas mission included 93 family members. Why?"" and speculated that Pelosi was leading a conspiracy to facilitate a terrorist assassination of President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, thus paving the way for her own elevation to the White House. (The speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives is second in the line of succession to the U.S. presidency, after the vice president.)
Why did Pelosis [sic] have all of her children and grandchildren - 93 family members going with her on her trip to Egypt, Afghanistan and Brussells? And 7 congress members? Who takes 93 family members (mostly children) on a secret government business trip on military aircraft, paid for by tax payer dollars?...
...Was Pelosis [sic] planning for the Jihadist Attack that was intercepted by the FBI a day or so ago, in Georgia to be successful? Remember he had rockets. And or was the Georgia arrest a first step leading into an upcoming false flag? Was it planned to take place while POTUS and V-P were together in the Oval Office or in one of the several buildings that were earmarked?
Pelosi is Third in Line of Succession, so if POTUS and V-P were both killed, (GOD FORBID) she would be the next President. Being out of the states (good alibi) the news would coordinate their talking points and gasp as they report how fortunate America is that Pelosi was not in DC! They would make up something like, ""If she hadn't been working overseas she would have been in that meeting and killed too"".  All media would have the same talking points that would be jumbled up and leading to the findings that the Georgia Jihadist was not working alone as they had thought. It was a big operation with several sleeper cells. 
The next question is -why would she be going to Brussels, Egypt and Afghanistan? Was she going to meet her deep state handlers in Brussels for her globalization instructions? Was she negotiating a new batch of mercenary's from the Muslim brotherhood in Egypt? Was she checking on deep state ""Poppy Bush's"" CIA opium lab in Afghanistan?  Maybe she was carrying out some diabolical scheme for the UN and NATO?  Who knows?
In support of the claim that Pelosi had intended to travel with 93 of her family members, the ""Marshall Report"" cited a series of tweets published on 18 January by the @BLUEPRINT_Q account. That Twitter account frequently publishes material related to the discredited ""QAnon"" conspiracy theory.
In this instance, @BLUEPRINT_Q was outlining a theory that claimed the 2018/19 federal government shutdown was actually part of a plot by President Trump to fight back against supposed ""deep state"" forces opposing him from within the federal government, by furloughing certain categories of government workers until he can (purportedly) fire them legally. 
As part of that theory, @BLUEPRINT_Q claimed that the planned congressional delegation excursion was not for the stated purpose of visiting U.S. military personnel stationed abroad, but rather was linked to the European Union, the Muslim Brotherhood and heroin trafficking. @BLUEPRINT_Q claimed that all of Speaker Pelosi's children and grandchildren were ""booked"" to take part in the trip, along with six other members of Congress and ""93 family members.""

10. Yesterday, @POTUS grounded @SpeakerPelosi's ""NATO"" trips to: Brussels (EU HQ), Egypt (Muslim Brotherhood HQ), Afghanistan (#Heroin HQ). ALL Pelosi's children and grandchildren were also booked, totaling 7 congressman and 93 family members grounded.
https://t.co/Ua5o32BLQQ
-- BLUEPRINT (@BLUEPRINT_Q) January 18, 2019 






 
It's clear that @BLUEPRINT_Q did not intend to claim that the delegation included 93 of only Pelosi's family members, but rather 93 relatives of the seven members of Congress. This is because @BLUEPRINT_Q cited as evidence for the involvement of family members another series of tweets published by another Twitter account that also frequently and enthusiastically promotes various strands of the QAnon conspiracy theory. 
Earlier on 18 January, @5Strat posted a conspiracy theory that claimed the purpose of the congressional delegation excursion was, in fact, to plot the ""demise"" of President Trump with NATO:

1) The Nancy Pelosi 7 day trip to Europe was in essence Nancy and 6 Angry Democrats going to meet with angry NATO (angry at having to pay their fair share) to plot the demise of @realDonaldTrump . Why should POTUS authorize the Air Force to transport a mission of Sedition?
-- John 'In the Desert' Salisbury (@5Strat) January 18, 2019
 
The original source of the ""family trip"" theory specified that 93 was the number of relatives of all seven members of Congress, and not of Pelosi alone, writing ""it wasn't just 7 angry Democrats. It was their extended families too, 93 of them."" 

3) Isn't it interesting that Nancy Pelosi had ALL her Children and ALL her Grandchildren booked on that flight?
If I didn't know any better I'd say someone might have been running...
-- John 'In the Desert' Salisbury (@5Strat) January 18, 2019
  






@5Strat did not provide any source or evidence in support of these claims, although they did cryptically allude to a purported need for secrecy about their purported sources, and claimed to have submitted a federal Freedom of Information request for details relating to the delegation. 
@5Strat, the original source of that claim, has a history of posting outlandish and bizarre conspiracy theories, especially the discredited QAnon conspiracy theory. In fact, the claim that the delegation included 93 family relatives of members of Congress was part of a conspiracy theory that alleged Pelosi and six Congressional Democrats had intended to travel abroad as part of a NATO plot to assassinate President Trump and Vice President Pence, and install Pelosi in the White House. 
The same Twitter account has written that ""Extraterrestrials have enslaved this World since the dawn of time,"" and recently endorsed a numerology-linked conspiracy theory that holds that the dates of various events in President Trump's life -- most recently, a ""blood moon"" on the two-year anniversary of his inauguration -- prove that he was chosen by God to lead the United States.
On 19 January 2019, Fred Doucette, a Republican member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives and a co-chair of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential election campaign, promoted the ""93 family members"" claim and implied that the planned excursion had nefarious and hidden purposes:

What Americans don't know@realDonaldTrump grounded @SpeakerPelosi ""NATO"" trips to: Brussels (EU HQ), Egypt (Muslim Brotherhood HQ), Afghanistan (#Heroin HQ) ""ALL"" Pelosi's children and grandchildren were also booked, totaling 7 congressman and 93 family members #FamilyOuting pic.twitter.com/0QjaVRAuc2
-- Representative Fred Doucette (@FredDoucetteNH) January 19, 2019

We requested comment from all seven Congressional members of the cancelled delegation: House Speaker Pelosi and U.S. Reps. Adam Schiff, Susan Davis, Eliot Engel, Elaine Luria, Stephen Lynch and Mark Takano. We did not receive a response from any of them.

As a new strain of coronavirus spread around the globe in 2020, a steady stream of misinformation spread on the internet. While we've encountered a number of far-fetched conspiracy theories, ranging from the idea that this virus was a ""man-made bioweapon"" (false) to the claim that this disease was being spread by 5G cellular towers (also false), the most dangerous piece of misinformation was far more simple: that COVID-19 was no more dangerous than the flu and this ""pandemic"" was being overhyped by the media.
No single source exists for this dangerous and untrue rumor. While one could point the finger at any number of parties for downplaying the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic, the fact remains that a large portion of Americans didn't see our current situation as much of a threat in the first few months of 2020. A Pew Research poll taken between March 19 and March 24 found that only 36% of Americans (41% of Democrats, 30% of Republicans) determined the pandemic to be a major threat to their personal health. 
At the same time this poll was being taken, New York declared a statewide shelter-in-place order, the 2020 Olympics were officially delayed, non-medical companies started to manufacture ventilators and masks, and the United States confirmed its 50,000th reported case of COVID-19. Despite these society-changing events, the vast majority of Americans did not see this disease as a threat to their personal health. 
Why? It may have to do with viral misinformation that repeatedly told them there was nothing to worry about. For instance, on March 13, a few days before this poll was taken and, coincidentally, the same day U.S. President Donald Trump declared a national emergency, a chain message started to circulate on Facebook that insisted the pandemic was nothing more than a media creation:

There's nothing particularly unique about the above-displayed Facebook message. Since the COVID-19 outbreak began, we've covered dozens of Facebook posts making similar claims. While these posts made a wide range of assertions (from bogus health cures to accusations of bio-terrorism), they all flirted with the idea that this disease was a hoax and that health officials and the media were not telling people the truth. 
This particular piece of misinformation received extra attention, however, because it was shared on the Facebook page of a woman who reportedly died from complications related to COVID-19. 
In April 2020, screenshots showing this post on Karen Kolb Sehlke's Facebook page, as well as screenshots showing a GoFundMe page set up for Sehlke and her family after she entered the hospital, went viral on social media: 

March 14th: *posted COVID-19 hoax, anti-socialism rant on FB*
April 2nd: *died of COVID-19, family asking for GoFundMe donations*
I post this not to mock Karen Kolb Sehlke's death, but to underscore the tragic risk one takes when taking this pandemic for granted. #RIP #StaySafe pic.twitter.com/MAKYAYVyGx

While Twitter user Sunn m'Cheaux wrote that he posted those screenshots ""not to mock Karen Kolb Sehlke's death, but to underscore the tragic risk one takes when taking this pandemic for granted,"" other social media users weren't so reserved. Sehlke's Facebook page, as well as her husband's, were bombarded with less-than-sympathetic messages that more or less claimed Sehlke got what she deserved. 
When family members removed these posts, a new conspiracy sprung up holding that this woman never existed, and that this story was just Russian disinformation. The GoFundMe page was also edited to remove mentions of the coronavirus, which cast even more doubt on this incident.
But Sehlke was a real person. We found messages from her friends and family mourning her loss shortly after she passed away. While we can't say for certain that her death was related to COVID-19, an early update to her GoFundMe page did claim she had tested positive for the disease. In addition to multiple screenshots of this comment, we captured a cached version of this update via Google. 
 We also know for certain that Sehlke did not write the viral piece of misinformation posted to her Facebook page and displayed at the beginning of this article. While we don't yet know who penned the missive, the post is the earliest version we could find and was shared more than 20,000 times. And the text was online at least a day before it appeared on Sehlke's Facebook page. 
At the time of this writing, the U.S. had more than 375,000 cases of COVID-19, resulting in more than 11,000 deaths, and nearly 10 million people have filed for unemployment as a result of shelter-in-place orders aimed at slowing the spread of the disease. In other words, this disease is not a hoax and this disease does not care about your political affiliation. 
As the United States and the rest of the world continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to turn to trusted sources for information about the disease. Readers can get more information about COVID-19 from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If you have a question about the coronavirus (or if you've encountered a piece of misinformation that you'd like to see debunked), please let us know.

Quick Take
A conspiracy theory on Facebook is falsely claiming that the killing of George Floyd was ""filmed before covid19"" because ""[n]ot a single person is wearing a mask"" in the videos. Some of the officers and officials in the videos can clearly be seen wearing masks.


Full Story 
Since the May 25 killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, conspiracy theories about his death have swirled online as posts have falsely suggested that the death was ""staged"" or that ""crisis actors"" were involved.
Now, a repeatedly posted image on Facebook feeding into that narrative wrongly claims that the killing was ""filmed before covid19"" because ""not a single person is wearing a mask"" in the videos.
""It just dawned on me the most glaring component of the Floyd psyop... it was filmed before covid19... How do I know... Not a single person is wearing a mask..."" the post claims. It specifically asserts that Floyd and ""the cops,"" among others, were not wearing masks.
But the claim is undercut by a review of footage that is publicly available.
Take the viral video that shows former Police Officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck, for example. The video, captured by a bystander, shows that two EMTs who arrived at the scene, and who helped put Floyd into an ambulance, can be seen wearing surgical masks.
Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder, second-degree manslaughter and second-degree unintentional murder while committing a felony.
  
Other footage captured by surveillance cameras at a nearby restaurant also shows that former Officer Thomas Lane -- one of three officers charged with aiding and abetting unintentional second-degree murder, and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter -- was also wearing a mask.
Another officer who was present at the scene can also be seen wearing a face covering, the surveillance video shows. More footage captures a firefighter, who arrived after the ambulance left, also wearing a mask.
So the assertion that ""[n]ot a single person is wearing a mask"" in the videos is false. The footage, in fact, undercuts the baseless theory that Floyd's death was ""filmed before covid19.""

27.DidtheFECChairAskTru,"
President Donald Trump has, since even before his election in November 2016, made false or unfounded allegations of widespread voter fraud's influencing the results and outcomes of major elections in the United States.
He has repeatedly claimed, without ever providing evidence, that his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton only won the popular vote as a result of mass-scale electoral fraud and promulgated baseless conspiracy theories about substantial voter fraud taking place in various 2018 midterm and statewide elections. 
As president, Trump established a commission to investigate potential large-scale electoral fraud, despite the absence of credible evidence that would typically justify such an action. The commission was disbanded without having found any such evidence.
More recently, Trump claimed in August 2019 that he had only lost out to Clinton in New Hampshire in 2016 because the state was ""taken away"" as a result of ""thousands and thousands of people coming in from locations unknown [to vote in New Hampshire]."" He did not cite or provide any evidence to support those claims. 
In the days following that latest baseless allegation of voter fraud, a letter was shared on social media that purported to have been written by Ellen Weintraub, chair of the Federal Election Commission, and addressed to Trump. It prompted multiple inquires from readers about its authenticity and provenance. 

FEC Chair Ellen Weintraub's letter to Donald Trump, August 16 ??? pic.twitter.com/QImi9ekC8v
-- Cass Pursell (@CassCpursell) August 17, 2019 







The letter, from a relatively important federal official to the sitting U.S. president, was unusually combative and is worth quoting from in full:
August 16, 2019
Mr. President,
Back in February 2017, when you first alleged a voter-fraud scheme of astonishing scale in New Hampshire in 2016, I publicly called upon you to provide your evidence to the American people and the appropriate law-enforcement authorities so that your very serious claims could be investigate. I followed up in March 2017 with a letter to you repeating my request. You have not, so far, provided any proof of these allegations. 
Last night, you repeated your claim: ""New Hampshire should've been won last time,"" you told reporters before your rally, ""except we had a lot of people come in at the last moment, which was a rather strange situation, thousands and thousands of people, coming in from locations unknown. But I knew where their location was."" During your rally, you told the crowd that New Hampshire was ""taken away from us.""
What I wrote to you in March 2017 is just as true now: Our democracy depends on the American people's faith in our elections. Your voter-fraud allegations run the risk of undermining that faith. Just as seriously, baseless allegations of fraud have been used to rationalize indefensible laws that deter certain U.S. citizens from exercising their right to vote. Words matter, and facts matter. 
The American people count on me, as the Chair of their Federal Election Commission, to protect the integrity of our elections. So I ask you, once again, to provide any evidence you may have to the American people and the appropriate law-enforcement authorities to substantiate your claims. The American people are ill-served when our leaders put forward unfounded allegations of voter fraud. 
To put it in terms a former casino operator should understand: There comes a time when you need to lay your cards on the table or fold. 
Sincerely, 
Ellen L. Weintraub
Chair, Federal Election Commission. 
The letter was authentic. Weintraub even posted it to her verified Twitter account on Aug. 16:

SAD: Last night, @realDonaldTrump again made unfounded claims about massive voter fraud in NH in 2016.
In this letter, I ask him to back up his claims in terms a former casino operator should understand: ""There comes a time when you need to lay your cards on the table or fold."" pic.twitter.com/vkddT1jGmH

Three days later, Weintraub discussed her letter and its contents in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper: 

FEC chair Ellen Weintraub says Pres. Trump's baseless claims of election fraud undermine people's faith in the system: ""The end result is that it becomes harder to vote and more citizens end up disenfranchised ... [Our democracy] will be stronger if we can get more people to vote."" pic.twitter.com/QuuNvWASFy

13.BillGatesplannedasmallpoxtypeoutbreak,"
A Facebook post claims that Microsoft founder Bill Gates planned the monkeypox clusters in Europe and North America and that there is a coordinated effort to plan virus outbreaks. 
Monkeypox is a virus related to smallpox. Monkeypox cases around the world are being investigated by public health authorities, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
A May 22 Facebook post shared a screenshot of what appeared  to be a prior post from Feb. 19. That February post included a photo of Gates and text that read: ""I actually think it will be a smallpox-type outbreak. He has mentioned it several times and look in the comments from the Google pic from yesterday."" 
""It's hard to fathom why people in power would want to do evil things,"" text in the May 22 post read. 
This post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Gates has talked about smallpox, but he has done so in the context of preparing for an outbreak, not planning one. In a conversation with former British health secretary Jeremy Hunt in November 2021, Gates talked about the level of funding and organization required to prepare for pandemics, and said that funding could go to things such as ""germ games,"" where public health authorities test different scenarios. 
Shortly after Gates' conversation with Hunt, social media users inaccurately linked Gates with vials labeled ""smallpox"" found in a Pennsylvania laboratory. The vials contained the virus that is used in the smallpox vaccine, vaccinia, not the virus that causes smallpox, variola. PolitiFact found no connection between Gates' comments and the discovery of the vials.

According to International Olympic Committee data, ""an average of 29 athletes under the age of 35 suffered sudden death per year from 1966 to 2004. From March 2021 to March 2022, 769 athletes have died or suffered cardiac arrest.""

The ""Google pic"" the Facebook user mentions is likely the Google Doodle from Feb. 17, which is a drawing of Japanese virologist Dr. Michiaki Takahashi, who developed the first vaccine against chicken pox. Google described his work this way: ""Takahashi's vaccine has since been administered to millions of children around the world as an effective measure to prevent severe cases of the contagious viral disease and its transmission.""
Gates, a philanthropist who has used part of his fortune to promote public health, has long been a target of misinformation by people who object to vaccines. Gates financially supports and promotes vaccine development. There is no evidence to support the conspiracy theory that he has planned virus outbreaks.
Gates and The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have committed funding to prepare for pandemics, not to plan them.
Our ruling
A Facebook post claimed that Gates planned a smallpox-type outbreak.
That's unfounded. Gates has spoken about preparing for future pandemics, not orchestrating them.
Gates has long been the target of baseless conspiracy theories by people suspicious of his work to fund and promote vaccine development. 
We rate this statement False.

62.CouldJan6riotersface,"
In recent years, it's been rare to see prosecutors file sedition charges. But there are signs that participants in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot could face such charges in the coming months.
Michael R. Sherwin, the federal prosecutor who until recently led the Justice Department's investigation into the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6, told CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that some of the participants could soon face sedition-related charges.
""I personally believe the evidence is trending toward that, and probably meets those elements,"" Sherwin said in an interview broadcast March 21. ""I believe the facts do support those charges. And I think that, as we go forward, more facts will support that.""
Legal experts told PolitiFact they generally agreed with Sherwin's assessment that a sedition prosecution could be appropriate for the attack on the Capitol, given what was happening in the building that day, and the trail of evidence the participants left behind.
We wanted to dive into what that means.
Sedition broadly refers to anti-government conduct. It's important to recognize that there are two major varieties, which are often confused. 
One type of sedition involves anti-government speech. Prosecutions for this type of sedition have a controversial history, with critics saying the government unfairly targeted constitutionally protected political dissent. This variety of sedition is often referred to as ""seditious libel.""
The other type of sedition involves anti-government acts, rather than just speech. Prosecutions of this type are much more rare historically, but this is the category that would most likely apply to the events of Jan. 6.
""The most famous use of 'sedition' has been in statutes such as the Sedition Act of 1798, which expressly covered anti-government speech, building on the common-law offense of 'seditious libel,'"" said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at University of California-Los Angeles. ""The current meaning, though, has to do with 'seditious conspiracy.'""
Let's take a closer look at each type.

Text of the Sedition Act of 1798
Seditious libel
The first and most famous example of a law criminalizing seditious libel is the Sedition Act of 1798, which permitted the deportation, fine or imprisonment of anyone deemed a threat or publishing ""false, scandalous, or malicious writing"" against the government of the United States. 
The press was highly partisan and often vicious at the time, and supporters of the law were open about their distaste for such political commentary. But the law proved unpopular, and it helped lead to the defeat of President John Adams in 1800. Under his successor, Thomas Jefferson, the law expired and was not renewed.
The Sedition Act of 1918 was enacted during World War I and made it a crime to write or publish ""any disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language"" about the government or the war effort.
Political dissenters such as Eugene Debs, a leading socialist, went to prison for speaking out against the war, and prosecutions such as his worried civil libertarians. The law was upheld as constitutional, but it was repealed in 1921. Portions of a related law, the Espionage Act of 1917, live on, although elements of the law have been curtailed by the courts.

""For a long time, the U.S. did prosecute people under the Espionage or Sedition acts for seditious libel and gave relatively little protection to people for speech that had a tendency to cause others to commit unlawful conduct,"" said Geoffrey R. Stone, a University of Chicago law professor and author of ""Perilous Times: Free Speech in Wartime from the Sedition Act of 1798 to the War on Terrorism.""
This began to change in the late 1950s, Stone said, culminating in the 1969 Supreme Court decision in Brandenburg vs. Ohio, which set a high bar for conviction: The potential unlawful conduct resulting from the speech needed to be imminent, likely, and intended by the speaker.
""Today, it would be very difficult to prosecute a case of seditious libel,"" Stone said.
Seditious conspiracy
The kind of sedition that could be an issue in the Jan. 6 legal fallout involves acts, not just speech. 
Under current federal law, a seditious conspiracy is defined as two or more persons conspiring to do one of two things by force. One is to overthrow the government of the United States. The other is ""to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States."" The law comes with a fine or imprisonment up to 20 years, or both.
Experts said a prosecution for conspiring to overthrow the U.S. government would be plausible, but challenging.
However, there's another provision of the law available to prosecutors -- conspiring to interfere with the execution of a law -- that would be an easier vehicle for Jan. 6-related prosecutions, since the rioters who entered the Capitol were there as lawmakers were carrying out their constitutional duty to officially count the electoral votes for president.
""I believe there will be strong, prosecutable cases under the federal seditious conspiracy statute,"" said Rodney A. Smolla, dean of Widener University's Delaware Law School.
The rioters ""clearly wanted to shut down by force the execution of the law then being voted upon in Congress,"" said James Robenalt, a lawyer with an expertise in political crises. The law ""doesn't get much more squarely on point.""

To make a conspiracy case, prosecutors would have to prove intent and the existence of a concrete agreement among the participants. This is always a challenge for prosecutors, experts said, but in this case, they may have an advantage.
Many participants in the storming of the Capitol ""left a documentary record on email, social media or videos which would provide clear evidence of an agreement,"" said Carlton Larson, a law professor at the University of California-Davis. Some of them were members of specific anti-government groups or militias.
For their part, the defendants in a seditious conspiracy case are likely to raise First Amendment claims, and ""argue they are being prosecuted for protected activities: advocating overthrow of government in the abstract, or engaging in political protest,"" said Timothy Zick, a law professor at the College of William & Mary.
But experts said that if a tangible agreement is proven, a First Amendment defense would likely be weak.
""Conspiracy is not speech,"" Stone said. ""If you agree to rob a bank with someone else, you don't get First Amendment protection"" for your discussions.
Experts saw potential charges of sedition as an intended use of the law, and not as a return to overzealous, 20th-century practices against dissenting speech.
""Since the crime is seditious conspiracy, I am not too worried about the ugly history of the 1798 and 1918 Sedition Acts,"" Larson said. ""The problem with those acts was their criminalization of potentially disloyal speech. The prosecutions here address conduct that is unacceptable in any law-abiding society.""

85.SeparatingFactfromFi,"
WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Donald Trump has been fulminating for weeks over the impeachment inquiry, which he sees as a persecution cooked up by Democrats and ""Never Trumpers.""
In reality, a collection of witnesses that includes Still Trumpers, Once Trumpers and the apolitical civil service has put together a largely cohesive account of a president exerting pressure on a foreign power for political benefit at home.
On Wednesday, with the opening of historic public hearings, Republicans in the House are primed to defend him while Democrats lean in to make their points before a presumably big TV audience.
Here's a guide to separating fact from fiction on subjects likely to be heard in the hearings:
___ 






NO PRESSURE?
Republicans seem disinclined to echo Trump's description of his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as ""perfect."" But they do suggest it was harmless.
A Republican staff memo, laying out talking points for the hearings, asserts that the rough transcript of the call ""shows no conditionality or evidence of pressure.""
In fact, Trump clearly exerted pressure in the phone call. As well, he made his request for a Ukrainian investigation of Democrats right after Zelenskiy raised the subject of U.S. military assistance.
When Zelenskiy told him Ukraine was ""almost ready"" to buy more anti-tank missiles from the U.S., Trump responded: ""I would like you to do us a favor, though.""
Trump did not state explicitly that he would hold back military aid or benefits to Ukraine unless he got what he wanted.
But he repeatedly stated that both his attorney general and personal lawyer would follow up with phone calls about the investigation he was seeking, and ""we will get to the bottom of it.""
Moreover, Trump's people were engaged in a systematic effort behind the scenes for months to get Ukraine to probe Joe and Hunter Biden and other Democrats. According to closed-door testimony, U.S. military aid was not to be resumed until Ukraine made a public statement committing to an investigation. 






___
THE 'RABBIT HOLE'
Trump's statements about Ukraine rest on two arguments, which House Republicans are echoing to varying degrees despite scant evidence behind the allegations.
One is that Joe Biden used the vice presidency to protect his son Hunter, who was doing business in that country. The other is that Ukraine colluded with Democrats to the disadvantage of the 2016 Trump campaign.
The first argument has this much going for it: Hunter Biden's position on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, while his father was serving as an emissary to that country, looked bad. Yet no wrongdoing by either Biden has been substantiated.
The second argument hangs on a fevered conspiracy theory that even some Trump officials have tried to bat away.
Trump's first homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, said Trump was told by his staff that the theory was ""completely debunked"" well before the president pressed Ukraine to investigate it.
The theory resurfaced from GOP lawmakers in the closed impeachment hearings, exasperating Fiona Hill, an intelligence official from the Bush and Obama administrations who served as special assistant to Trump on the National Security Council until she resigned in the summer. 






""It is a fiction that the Ukrainian government was launching an effort to upend our election,"" Hill testified. ""I'm extremely concerned that this is a rabbit hole that we're all going to go down in between now and the 2020 election, and it will be to all of our detriment.""
___
A RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS
It's been a familiar refrain from Republicans throughout the impeachment inquiry: The proceedings are an illegal ""sham"" and a ""coup,"" and Trump has a right to confront his main accuser, an anonymous whistleblower.
""Fake Hearing (trial) in the House, as they interview Never Trumpers and others, I get NO LAWYER & NO DUE PROCESS,"" Trump tweeted recently.
Trump is off the mark.
The House is conducting a hearing, not a trial, so no constitutional rights are being violated here.
Nor is there any illegal takeover afoot --the impeachment process is unfolding as outlined in the Constitution, which gives the House the sole power to impeach and the Senate the sole power to remove a president from office. 






Trump is correct that he and his legal team are excluded from the public hearings beginning Wednesday, but he hasn't been charged with anything and has no constitutional right to be represented by a lawyer in this proceeding.
The hearings led by the House Intelligence Committee are akin to the investigative phase of criminal cases, generally conducted in private and without the participation of the person under investigation.
In future House Judiciary Committee hearings that presumably would result in the drafting of impeachment articles, Trump would be invited to attend and his lawyers could question witnesses and object to testimony and evidence, similar to the process in the impeachment proceedings against Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.
If there is a Senate trial, Trump's legal team would defend the president against impeachment articles approved by the House in an environment that would look like a typical trial in some respects.
___
WHERE'S THE CRIME?
The hearings may feature debate over what constitutes a crime for purposes of impeachment. If so, that may be beside the point.
Under the Constitution, impeachment involves a political judgment about whether public officials have abused their office to the detriment of the country and therefore should be removed from that office.
A crime may establish that condition. But a president could still be subject to impeachment even if the conduct is not a crime.
Soliciting or accepting election help from a foreign entity is illegal. But it's not clear that the overseas investigation sought by Trump qualifies as an illegal campaign benefit. It does not need to qualify as one if Congress renders the judgment that it's an abuse of office.
___
'SHIFTY SCHIFF'
Expect Rep. Adam Schiff, the public face of Democrats' impeachment inquiry who will open the hearings, to be a frequent target of Trump and Republican lawmakers. Trump has even called on the intelligence committee chairman to be made to testify as a witness subject to cross-examination.
In the president's eyes, ""Shifty Schiff"" is guilty of almost everything: fabricating Trump's conversation with Ukraine's president, writing the whistleblower's complaint himself, treason. None of that is true.
""Didn't he pick the Whistleblower?"" Trump tweeted Nov. 2.
""It's a scandal he knew before. I go a step further. I think he probably helped write it,"" Trump told reporters Oct. 2.
The whistleblower did speak to staffers on the House Intelligence Committee on procedural issues before filing the formal complaint that would trigger the impeachment inquiry. But Trump and his GOP allies are taking a big leap in asserting that Schiff schemed with the whistleblower to lodge the complaint.
Patrick Boland, a spokesman for Schiff, said that committee staff advised the person to contact an inspector general and to seek counsel, but that the committee did not get an early look at the complaint.
The whistleblower's lawyer, Mark Zaid, said the person had never met or spoken with Schiff about the matter.
Trump also has repeatedly claimed that Schiff ""illegally made up a FAKE & terrible statement"" about his Ukraine phone call, sometimes asserting that the California Democrat was then caught in ""a total lie"" after Trump released a rough transcript of the call. Trump has branded Schiff's acts treason.
Trump is exaggerating the episode and botching the timeline.
Schiff delivered what he called a parody of Trump's remarks in the president's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's leader.
Schiff did so after the White House released a rough transcript of the call, not before. So people who read the official account knew Schiff was riffing from it, not quoting from it.
Trump loosely throws around accusations of treason, extending it, for example, to Democratic immigration policy and negative newspaper coverage.
Under the Constitution, treason occurs when a U.S. citizen, or a noncitizen on U.S. territory, wages war against the country or provides material support to a declared enemy of the United States. It is defined narrowly as part of an effort by the framers to prevent the government from using it as a reason to suppress political speech. No one has been convicted of treason since the aftermath of World War II.
___
THE 'NEVER TRUMPERS'
Trump says the arguments against him are ""made up garbage by Shifty Schiff and the Never Trumpers!""
His point misrepresents the breadth of the testimony heard in the closed-door hearings. The witnesses are not all hostile to the president or part of a cabal against him.
Problematic testimony has come from people who worked assiduously to get Ukraine to do what Trump wanted. Among them: Gordon Sondland, a wealthy donor to Trump's 2016 campaign whose loyalty was rewarded with his appointment as U.S. envoy to the European Union.
Reversing a key point of his testimony, Sondland said he had conveyed to a Ukrainian official that the country's leadership would need to announce an investigation of the Bidens and Democrats as a condition of getting the military aid that Trump had frozen.

The footage in the video comes from news coverage of a recent FBI raid in downtown Cleveland. But what does that have to do with Ukraine? And how are American politicians involved? 
In short: They aren't. Let's break it down. 
First: the raid. 
On Aug. 4, agents with the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service raided offices in Miami and Cleveland that belong to Optima Management Group LLC. Optima is a Miami investment company that has properties across the country. 
The raid was part of a money laundering investigation that's been going on for more than a year.
""The affidavit is under seal so I cannot provide any specifics regarding the investigation,"" FBI Special Agent Vicki Anderson said in an email. ""I can say no one was taken into custody. This continues to be an ongoing investigation.""
Next: the Ukraine connection.
The Cleveland Plain Dealer reports that Optima is partially owned by principals of the Privat Group, a large business group based in Ukraine. One of those principals is Ukrainian oligarch Igor Kolomoisky

In the early 1990s, Kolomoisky founded PrivatBank. It became a key banking institution in the country, serving about half of Ukraine's population. 
In 2016, the government nationalized the company, claiming that it did not have enough capital to support its loan portfolio. The Financial Times reported that PrivatBank lent billions of dollars to Kolomoisky associates.
In April 2019, the Daily Beast reported that the FBI was investigating Kolomoisky -- who no longer owns PrivatBank and reportedly lives in Israel -- for potential financial crimes, including money laundering. The U.S. Attorney's Office in the Northern District of Ohio was also part of the investigation since Kolomoisky has investments there.
In early August, the Justice Department accused Kolomoisky of stealing billions of dollars from PrivatBank and using an array of companies around the world, including some in the United States, to launder the money. Kolomoisky's lawyer has denied the allegations.
But how is all that related to Ukraine more broadly? 
President Volodymyr Zelensky is a former comic, and Kolomoisky owns the TV station that used to air his show. Kolomoisky is considered to be a Zelensky ally.
Which brings us to the third part of the Facebook post: the connection -- or lack thereof -- to American politicians.
In 2019, a phone call with Zelensky was the subject of President Donald Trump's impeachment. The investigation was prompted by a whistleblower's complaint about the July 2019 call, during which Trump asked Zelensky to investigate the Biden family's dealings in Ukraine.
Hunter Biden served as a board member for Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, from 2014 until the spring of 2019. He did so when his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, was representing U.S. policy on the country.
There's no evidence to suggest that the sons of Kerry and Romney ever held similar positions. We rated a similar claim False in October 2019.
RELATED: Pelosi, Romney and Kerry don't have sons working for companies linked to Ukraine
Pelosi's son, Paul, once served on the board of an American energy company, Viscoil, that dissolved and re-formed in Singapore under a different name. It's unclear to what extent the company has done business in Ukraine, but Paul Pelosi had no part in the new entity.
Back to the Facebook post. 
It's correct to say that a company linked to Ukraine was recently raided by the FBI. But there is no evidence that the sons of Biden, Pelosi, Kerry and Romney got ""tens of millions of dollars from no-show jobs in Ukraine."" They are all unrelated to the ongoing investigation of Kolomoisky's alleged money laundering.
The post is inaccurate. We rate it False.

Multiple reports of shots fired occurred in the U.S. Capitol after the building was breached by protesters on Jan. 6, 2021.
Huffington Post Congressional Reporter Matt Fuller shared this picture at 2:44 p.m. EST:

Getty photographer Drew Angerer captured this same moment as well, apparently showing at least three officers in a standoff with an individual on the other side of a door:

At 3:32 p.m., CNN reported that a woman was in ""critical condition after being shot in the chest on the Capitol grounds, according to two sources familiar with the matter.""
At 3:47 p.m., NBC reported that five people had been transported to the hospital from the scene, with at least one of them being a police officer. NBC later reported that the woman who was shot had died.
The Washington Post later identified the woman as 35-year-old Ashli Babbitt, describing her as ""a California native and Air Force veteran [who] had used her social media to express fervent support for President Trump and echo many of the president's conspiracy theories and false claims of mass voter fraud."" 
This is a developing story.

200.IdontevenknowwhatQAnonis,"
House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., has been dealing with a fight in Congress over how to handle freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who has made comments supporting violence against Democrats and promoted the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory.
The FBI has called the QAnon movement a domestic terrorism threat, and its adherents were among those who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, driving McCarthy and other lawmakers out of their chambers as they counted electoral votes.
But in a press briefing Feb. 3, McCarthy professed ignorance about QAnon, and mispronounced its name. 
Defending Greene, he said: ""I think it would be helpful if you could hear exactly what she told all of us -- denouncing 'Q-on.' I don't know if I say it right. I don't even know what it is.""
pic.twitter.com/J2XfuRYVG7-- Acyn Torabi (@Acyn) February 4, 2021 
QAnon's involvement in the Capitol riot drove a surge in awareness of the movement, whose followers believe former President Donald Trump was on a secret mission to fight a cabal of Satan-worshipping, cannibalistic pedophiles that includes top-ranking Democrats and Hollywood celebrities. 
So can McCarthy fairly claim, less than a month after the riot, that he doesn't know what QAnon is -- or even how to say its name? 
No, he can't. 
McCarthy has spoken about QAnon publicly at least three times, and appeared to know enough about it to speak out against it. He's also pronounced the name correctly before.

In an Aug. 21 press briefing, McCarthy got a question about Greene, who had just won her primary in Georgia. In his answer, he explicitly denounced QAnon, which he called ""the Q organization."" 
""She recently came out and denounced the Q organization, whatever beliefs, I do not agree with their beliefs at all,"" he said. At the time, Greene hadn't denounced QAnon, although she had told Fox News that she had since chosen ""another path."" 
In an interview with Fox News that same day, McCarthy denounced QAnon a second time and pronounced it correctly. ""Let me be very clear: There is no place for QAnon in the Republican Party. I do not support it,"" he said.
During a November news conference, a reporter asked McCarthy if he was concerned about new members of Congress like Greene and Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., who have expressed support for QAnon. 

""Our party is very diverse. You mentioned two people who are going to join our party, and both of them have denounced Q-on,"" he replied, mispronouncing it again.
This was also misleading. While Boebert had attempted to distance herself from the conspiracy theory, Greene still had not. 
A McCarthy spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

02.DidanAntifaFlyerTell,"
What do antifa, Nov. 4, and riots have in common? They inspire conspiracy theories, it seems.
A circulated screenshot of an August 2020 Facebook post called on ""antifa comrades"" to disguise themselves as supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump. By wearing Make America Great Again (MAGA) hats, U.S. flags, and even a ""convincing"" police uniform, the post claimed, ""comrades"" could deceive police and news media into thinking Trump supporters, not antifa, were rioting on Nov. 4, 2020, a day after the U.S. presidential election.
Snopes readers shared a screenshot of this flyer and asked us to look into whether it was actually connected to antifa groups:

The meme read:
Antifa comrades! On Nov. 4 don't forget to disguise yourselves as patriots/Trump supporters: wear MAGA hats, USA flags, 3%er insignias, a convincing police uniform is even better!
This way police and patriots responding to us won't know who their enemies are, and onlookers and the media will think there are Trump supporters rioting so it's harder to turn popular opinion against us! 






We found no evidence that this meme was connected to any actual antifa groups.
We should note that ""antifa""-- short for anti-fascist -- is not a single group, but a very broad term referring to an amorphous coalition of leftist activist organizations that often act on their own initiative and don't have any centralized organizing body.
The flyer has circulated online before in 2017 and 2019, as well as in 2020. Conspiracy theories about anti-fascist groups rioting on Nov. 4 are common, especially across the conservative parts of the internet. However, the 2020 screenshot of the flyer was unique because it was attached to a post referencing the Nov. 3 presidential election, adding fuel to rumors that something could be afoot in the near future.  
Will Sommer, a politics reporter who also focuses on conservative media, investigated the origins of Nov. 4/antifa conspiracy theories and this meme in a 2017 Medium post. He pointed out how the above-displayed flyer was part of many ""fabricated 'planning documents'"" shared on Facebook that urge antifa movements to commit violence. Sommer's report also highlighted how left-leaning, anarchist media hub It's Going Down had disavowed any Nov. 4 activity. 
The 2020 version of the meme, a screenshot, showed Facebook user Katy Krasnow sharing it to the Hickman County Antifa Facebook group. We reached out to Krasnow and tried to locate the Hickman County Antifa page, which appeared to have been taken down. Krasnow confirmed to us that she did post the meme and it was meant to be a joke. She found it when she searched for ""antifa memes"" on DuckDuckGo, a search engine. She said:
Hickman County Antifa was a satire page, either the creator or Facebook took it down, that post was just a bad joke. I deleted soon after it got shared because it made a lot of people freak out more than I expected, nobody in the group was really actually connected, we were just sharing dumb antifa memes.
We reached out to Facebook to learn if the page was indeed deleted by a group administrator or by Facebook, and we will update this post if we receive more information.
But whether it was in 2020 or previous years, many people took such memes related to Nov. 4 seriously. Back in 2017, pro-Trump blog The Gateway Pundit ran a headline stating ""Millions of Antifa Supersoldiers Will Behead White Parents"" on that day. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones also claimed antifa activists would be handing out AK-47s on Nov. 4. 
Snopes investigated similar claims in 2017 that argued law enforcement agents had announced that ""antifa"" was planning ""extended violent unrest or civil war"" beginning on Nov. 4. We found there was no truth behind these rumors.
@AntifaChecker, a Twitter account devoted to sniffing out phony ""antifa"" accounts, indicated it was not aware of the 2017 call to action:

yeah, we haven't heard anything about november 4
-- Antifa Checker (@AntifaChecker) October 1, 2017

We found no evidence of violent, antifa-led insurrections occurring in the U.S. on Nov. 4 over the past few years. On Nov. 4, 2017, there were anti-Trump rallies organized around the country by leftist groups, but these were far cries from cases of ""rioting."" In New York City, for example, around 300 people showed up, leaflets were distributed, and only a handful of Trump supporters turned up to counterdemonstrate, according to news reports.
Because the source of the above-displayed post confirmed to us it was shared as a joke, rumors of Nov. 4 activity have been disavowed by known antifa media outlets in the past, and we found that this meme had no connection to actual antifa activities, we rate this claim as ""False.""

46.WereTheseMexicanPoli,"
On 20 October 2018, Twitter user Mike Allen posted a photograph of an injured police officer and stated that the pictured individual had been ""brutalized"" by a member of the migrant caravan that was making its way toward the United States in the fall of 2018:

Facebook user Jacque Guinan posted a nearly verbatim message which included two additional images of police officers who were also allegedly ""brutalized"" by this caravan of refugees :

We also found a network of smaller Twitter accounts parroting the same verbatim claim: ""Mexican police are being brutalized by members of this caravan as they attempt to FORCE their way into Mexico"": 







A caravan of migrants fleeing political and social unrest in their home country of Honduras was slowly making its way north in the fall of 2018 with the hopes that its participants could seek asylum in the United States. Some conservative pundits and politicians used this group of migrants to stoke fears about immigration. Florida Representative Matt Gaetz even floated an unfounded conspiracy theory positing (without evidence) that these refugees were being paid by alt-right boogeyman George Soros. President Trump, too, declared (without evidence) that this group consisted of ""criminals"" and ""unknown Middle Easteners.""
The above-displayed photographs appear to be yet another attempt to smear this group of refugees and stoke fears over immigration. These pictures do not capture police officers who were brutalized by members of the immigrant caravan making its way toward the United States in October 2018 -- they're all several years old and depict the aftermath of altercations between police officers and protesters in Mexico.
The main photograph attached to this rumor (showing an officer with a bloodied face) came from a 2012 incident involving students (not migrants) and police officers near Mexico City. Revista Emeequis reported that the students had been staging a protest at the school for more than a week when police officers came in and attempted to evict them from the building. More than 170 students were detained and at least 9 officers were injured during the altercation:
Mexico City, October 16 (2012). In a series of operations carried out early Monday morning, state and federal authorities detained 176 students from the teacher training schools of Cheran, Arteaga, and Tripetio in Michoacan.
The arrests occurred as the police officers cleared the school buildings, which for 10 days had been occupied by students protesting against changes in the school curriculum ...
A spokesman for the state government, Julio Cesar Hernandez, told a news conference that nine federal police officers and one member of the Special Operations Group (GOE) were injured during the operations.
The two other photographs attached to this rumor were also years-old and unrelated to migrant caravans. The image showing an injured officer on his knees on the street was taken in 2014 in Chilpancingo and was included in a gallery of photographs on the Mexican newspaper El Universal's web site and depicted another violent incident between police and students. According to BBC News, tensions between the police and protesters had been rising since a group of 43 students went missing a few months earlier in September 2014:

Mexican police have clashed with protesters organising a concert in the city of Chilpancingo in support of a group of 43 students who went missing more than two months ago.
Police said several officers had been injured, including some who were knocked down by a vehicle.
The two groups accused each other of starting Sunday's violence.
The case of the missing students, one of whom has been found dead, has triggered protests across Mexico.
The other image associated with this rumor was also snapped several years earlier and was in no way related to a Honduran migrant caravan. The photograph displaying an officer with a bloodied lip has been online since at least 2011, when it was shared in articles concerning another altercation between ""police and teachers"":

State Governor Gabino Cue Monteagudo offered a public apology to the people of Oaxaca for the grievances caused by ""police and teachers"" during their clash in the city's Zocalo and reiterated their willingness to engage in a new dialogue with Section 22 of the SNTE.
Through a statement, the state government refused to grant the resignations of the Secretary General of Government, Irma Pineyro Arias; the head of the Secretariat of Public Security, Marco Tulio Lopez Escamilla, and the director of the State Institute of Public Education of Oaxaca (IEEPO), Bernardo Vasquez Colmenares, as demanded by the teachers after the drift and during the mega-march made yesterday in the city From Oaxaca.
""The Government of the State disclaims any attempt of aggression or action that seeks to undermine the right to free expression, free transit and association, reserving its power to intervene when public order is affected, as well as physical and patrimonial integrity of third parties.""

65.DidBidensDeptofEnerg,"
In February 2021, as Texas began to recover from a devastating winter storm that brought record-low temperatures, killed dozens of people, and cut the power to millions of homes, a report emerged online that blamed the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden for supposedly denying requests to increase the electricity supply within the state.
On Feb. 20, the website Infowars, a notorious producer of conspiracy theories and inflammatory disinformation, published an article with the headline: ""Smoking Gun! Joe Biden's Dept. of Energy Blocked Texas from Increasing Power Ahead of Killer Storm."" The article reported that:
An Emergency Order from the Biden administration's Department of Energy shows Texas energy grid operator ERCOT was instructed to stay within green energy standards by purchasing energy from outside the state at a higher cost, throttling power output throughout the state ahead of a catastrophic polar vortex.
Major smoking gun! Infowars has been sent a Department of Energy document, confirmed to be authentic, showing Texas begging for federal authorization to increase power!
That article was subsequently republished on the website Your News, and both iterations were shared widely on Facebook in the following days.
The report was highly inaccurate. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) actually granted a request from Texas officials to temporarily allow energy providers to produce energy at levels that would ordinarily exceed limits set out in environmental regulations, thus having the opposite effect of that claimed by Infowars. 






The DOE's authorization did come with certain limitations, namely that the excess electricity generated must only meet levels that state officials deemed ""necessary,"" but in reality that was a restriction in principle only and effectively gave officials wide discretion to allow excess energy generation during the winter storm.
Analysis
Federal environmental laws and regulations impose certain standards and guidelines on power plants in the United States, limiting the emission of various harmful elements and compounds such as carbon monoxide, mercury, nitrogen oxide, and so on. 
At the same time, federal law -- in particular the Federal Power Act -- enables the U.S. energy secretary to declare an emergency in a specific location and ""to require by order such temporary connections of facilities and such generation, delivery, interchange, or transmission of electric energy as in [their] judgment will best meet the emergency and serve the public interest.""
Where producing and distributing additional electricity comes in conflict with other regulations, such as environmental regulations, the secretary is required to ensure that excess energy generation and distribution takes place ""only during hours necessary to meet the emergency and serve the public interest.""
On Feb. 14 the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the non-governmental organization that runs the electricity grid in the state of Texas, wrote to Acting Energy Secretary David Huizenga, requesting that he issue exactly that kind of emergency order. The letter outlined the dilemma faced by energy providers in Texas as follows:
ERCOT has been notified by three major generation owners that their generating units will, or are likely to, encounter operating restrictions during the next several days due to various emissions and other limits established in federal permits... These units are subject to a number of environmental limitations that may restrict output.
ERCOT has been informed that the operation of gas-fired generators during the next few days could be impacted by permit restrictions on nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide emissions, that coal-fired generators would be impacted by permit restrictions on emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury, and carbon monoxide, and that generation fueled by distillate fuel oil would be subject to various restrictions on operating duration and/or emissions. ERCOT has also been informed that generators of various fuel types may be subject to wastewater release limits...
Because the output from all of the generators subject to these restrictions would help mitigate the impact of rotating outages on Texas consumers during this extreme cold weather event, ERCOT seeks an immediate order from DOE authorizing the provision of additional energy from all generating units subject to emissions or other permit limitations.
Later that day, Huizenga issued Emergency Order No. 202-21-1, declaring that ""an emergency exists in Texas due to a shortage of electric energy, a shortage of facilities for the generation of electric energy, and other causes."" The order added: 
Given the emergency nature of the expected load stress, the responsibility of ERCOT to ensure maximum reliability on its system, and the ability of ERCOT to identify and dispatch generation necessary to meet the additional load, I have determined that additional dispatch of the Specified Resources is necessary to best meet the emergency and serve the public interest for purposes of FPA [Federal Power Act] section 202(c). Because the additional generation may result in a conflict with environmental standards and requirements, I am authorizing only the necessary additional generation, with reporting requirements... 






So Huizenga's order temporarily authorized ERCOT, from Feb. 14-19, to generate whatever power it deemed necessary to serve the needs of consumers in Texas, even if that additional generation would, in the normal course of events, cause emissions to exceed maximum levels set out in federal environmental laws and regulations.
In keeping with the provisions of the Federal Power Act, Huizenga ordered that the excess electricity must not go beyond what is necessary to address the ongoing emergency, but left the details of that determination to ERCOT itself, adding:
ERCOT anticipates that this Order may result in exceedance of emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury, and carbon monoxide emissions, as well as wastewater release limits. To minimize adverse environmental impacts, this Order limits operation of dispatched units to the times and within the parameters determined by ERCOT for reliability purposes. [Emphasis is added].
In its report, Infowars wrote that:
The [Emergency Order] shows the Biden administration basically ordered ERCOT to throttle its energy output by forcing it to comply with environmental green energy standards, while knowing full well Texans could freeze to death in their homes with zero electricity as temperatures plunged into the single digits.
In reality, as we have shown, the order did precisely the opposite.

09.NoJoeBidensWalkingBo,"
In late November 2020, U.S. President-elect Joe Biden suffered a hairline fracture in his right foot, which occurred after he tripped playing with his German shepherd, Major. The injury required him to wear an orthopedic boot to protect the bone while it heals.
Perhaps inevitably, the appearance of the boot on Biden's foot spawned conspiracy theories. Various social media accounts stated they believed the boot hid a GPS ankle monitor, because Biden, they said, was under arrest.
But this is just an iteration of other baseless claims sourced from the Qanon conspiracy theory, which posits that high-profile legislators and various celebrities are part of a child trafficking cabal. Other famous people and politicians alleged to have worn ankle monitors have been former President Barack Obama, actor Tom Hanks, and talk show hosts Ellen DeGeneres and Oprah Winfrey.
Here's an example of a social media post claiming Biden's boot, and similar medical devices worn by other political figures, is an ankle monitor. We cropped this Twitter user's name out for privacy:

Biden's doctor has confirmed the foot fracture in a statement, saying that he will need to wear a walking boot for several weeks during recovery.
No evidence exists that Biden's orthopedic boot is anything other than that, and claims otherwise are part of a baseless conspiracy theory.

131.ArizonaandGeorgianowhavetheproofJoeBidenisnotourelectedpresident,"
A meme falsely suggests that reviews of the 2020 presidential vote in two swing states show that Donald Trump won the election.
""Arizona & Georgia now have the proof,"" says the post, which includes a photo of a smiling Joe Biden. ""You are not our elected president!""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
It's understandable if the results in Arizona and Georgia were jarring to Trump supporters. He had won both states in 2016; in 2020, they were decided by a fraction of a percentage point.
Arizona: Biden: 1,672,143 votes, 49.36%; Trump: 1,661,686 votes, 49.06%.
Georgia: Biden: 2,473,633 votes, 49.5%; Trump: 2,461,854 votes; 49.26%.
But months of multiple reviews have not produced evidence to change the result in either state, much less Biden's election, which was certified by Congress hours after a pro-Trump mob's Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Arizona's result stands
Arizona's Maricopa County, home to Phoenix, conducted a hand count audit of a sample of ballots as required by state law and hired independent firms to conduct a forensic audit of tabulation equipment. The county found no abnormalities. 
But Republicans in the Arizona Senate hired a team including Cyber Ninjas, which has no prior experience auditing elections, to audit the Maricopa County results. The company's head, Doug Logan, was part of the ""stop the steal"" conspiracy theories about the election that culminated in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. 
Claims arising from the audit that we've debunked include: 


Trump said ""74,243 mail-in ballots were counted with 'no clear record of them being sent.'"" Our rating: False. The claim was based on confusion over the early voting process and a misuse of Maricopa County documents.

The claim in a viral image was that ""132,000 ballots in Fulton County, Ga., have been identified as likely ineligible,"" and Trump might win Georgia as a result. Our rating: False. The claim appeared to be based on a pollster's own queries of voter files, with no indication that he attempted to verify the legitimacy of his claim with election officials. 


Our ruling
Biden won more votes than Trump in what local, state and federal officials affirmed was a free and fair election. Recounts didn't change the outcome. States certified their results. Judges in courtrooms across the country rejected dozens of lawsuits seeking to overturn the election on Trump's behalf. The nation's electors cast their votes and sealed Biden's victory.
Nothing has happened to change the results in Arizona and Georgia. We rate the claim that Biden is not the elected president as Pants on Fire!

24.CaliforniaShootingPr,"



6.3KQ: Was Susan Orfanos, the mother of a shooting victim in Thousand Oaks, California, also interviewed by news outlets after other mass shootings in 2016 and 2017?

A: No. A Facebook post misidentifies two other women as Orfanos.  

FULL ANSWER
Following the Nov. 7 shooting in a bar in Thousand Oaks, California, that left 13 people dead, the mother of one of the victims made a tearful, forceful plea for gun control in front of cameras.
""I don't want prayers. I don't want thoughts. I want gun control,"" Susan Orfanos said. ""And I hope to God nobody else sends me any more prayers. I want gun control. No more guns.""
Orfanos' son, U.S. Navy veteran Telemachus ""Tel"" Orfanos, had previously survived the mass October 2017 Las Vegas shooting before being killed in the Borderline Bar & Grill.
Now, conspiracy theorists have used images of the mother alongside photos of women affected by other mass shootings to advance the idea that she is an actor, and that they are all the same person. The fact-free assertion is not unlike claims we debunked about the students who survived the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting.

A Facebook user, who appears to subscribe to the massive ""QAnon"" conspiracy theory, spread the unsubstantiated claim about Orfanos by posting a screenshot of her interview with screenshots of a mother and of a victim from other mass shootings. He wrote: ""JUST SO YOU KNOW NOT ONLY WAS SHE A MOM OF THE CALIFORNIA AND ORLANDO SHOOTINGS, BUT SHE WAS A VITCIM (sic) OF THE Las Vegas SHOOTING TOO!! ""
The other images are not of Orfanos, nor do they resemble her -- something that didn't stop thousands from sharing and liking versions of the conspiracy theory through memes and posts on Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.
The woman wearing a pink shirt in the Facebook post is actually Christine Leinonen, whose son, Christopher ""Drew"" Leinonen, died in the 2016 Orlando, Florida, shooting in the Pulse nightclub. The image of Leinonen is taken from an ABC News interview with George Stephanopoulos before she learned that her son had been killed.
Leinonen has since helped form the Dru Project, an LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, and spoke in favor of gun control at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.
Another woman falsely identified as being Orfanos is Jan Lambourne, who was shot in the abdomen during the 2017 Las Vegas shooting and survived. The image in the Facebook post is a screenshot from a CBC News interview she gave while recovering in the hospital. Lambourne, of the Manitoba province of Canada, can be seen in more recent photographs in a report documenting her recovery.

A gunman opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida on 14 February 2018, killing seventeen people -- mostly teenaged students. Immediately, in what has become a deeply troubling (yet entirely predictable) pattern, Internet trolls took the tragedy as yet another opportunity to hawk ""false flag"" conspiracy theories.
Before the families of massacre victims even had the chance to bury their loved ones, disreputable outlets and personalities like InfoWars' Alex Jones began claiming without evidence the shooting was a ""false flag,"" or a government operation carried out for the purpose of seizing guns from Americans.
Alex Leary, Washington bureau chief for the Tampa Bay Times, reported that an aide for Florida Rep. Shawn Harrison had claimed in an official e-mail that child survivors of the Florida shooting were ""crisis actors"" who travel around the country posing as victims in mass shootings:

Here's the email. I asked for more information to back up the claim and was sent another email that linked to a YouTube conspiracy video. pic.twitter.com/VRSVOcjj3E
-- Alex Leary (@learyreports) February 20, 2018


I was just made aware that my aide made an insensitive and inappropriate allegation about Parkland students today. I have spoken to him and placed him on leave until we determine an appropriate course of action. I do not share his opinion and he did so without my knowledge.
-- Shawn Harrison (@Shawnfor63) February 20, 2018 








I've been terminated from the State House. I made a mistake whereas I tried to inform a reporter of information relating to his story regarding a school shooting. This was not my responsibility. I meant no disrespect to the students or parents of Parkland.
-- Benjamin Kelly (@benakelly) February 20, 2018

Others pounced on a Google search engine glitch that mischaracterizes the publishing dates of news stories to claim reports about the shooting were posted in advance. For example, a site dedicated to anti-Semitic conspiracy theorist Henry Makow posted an image of the Google search results and claimed there were ""crisis actors"" and multiple shooters, both common conspiracy theory motifs.
Images like this one circulated on the message board 4chan and various other disreputable web sites:

It might look damning, except that this screenshot shows nothing more than the result of a known glitch with Google that sometimes shows the wrong dates in search results, as a Google spokeswoman told us: 
Listing the date and time for news stories is complicated, as there is no universal standard used. Sometimes, stories have no date and time on the webpage. Sometimes, a story may appear on a page that lists related stories, and they all have different dates and times shown. Sometimes a publisher might be in a different time zone and the date gets picked up incorrectly. All these things may cause us to occasionally list the wrong date. We're looking at ways to improve.
Google's public search liaison Danny Sullivan addressed the issue on Twitter, explaining why some of the article dates were misleading:

The time comes from this embedded in the story's code:
datetime=""2018-02-14T14:40:35+00:00''
That means the story is as of 2:40pm UTC -- IE Greenwich time, not Miami time. The publication likely forgot to set the time zone to Miami, mistakenly reporting it five hours early.
-- Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) February 14, 2018


The first is because we picked up the wrong date for a related article at the end. The others are going to be similar. We can get the wrong date for a variety of reasons. pic.twitter.com/tpKtRqrPr6

The ""false flag"" conspiracy theory is applied almost as a reflexive reaction to promote unfounded fears of a government takeover, which will be preceded by a forcible national gun grab (although there's never any explanation offered for how a government entity might be clever enough to keep the same hoax with the same people going over and over again for years but too stupid to be able to orchestrate a full takeover).
Although it is hardly original, it is sadly employed as grounds to harass victims of mass shootings. Since at least the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, the families of shooting victims have been relentlessly harassed. One conspiracy theorist was sentenced to prison for sending a death threat to the father of a child who was killed in that shooting.

An image that appears in multiple Facebook posts is claimed to show a naked boy escaping from Buckingham Palace.  The text on the image says ""I suppose this photo of a naked boy escaping Buckingham Palace is just more conspiracy theory?""
The image itself is a screenshot from a video that has been circulating since 2019, which claims the footage is evidence that the world is ""controlled by paedophiles"".
This is incorrect.
The image comes from a viral hoax circulated to promote an E! fictional TV series ""The Royals."" The video was staged with an adult man and is not a real event involving any children.

Fifty years ago this Saturday, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to set foot on the moon. But not everyone believes it.
Almost as soon as the Apollo 11 spaceflight landed at Tranquility Base on July 20, 1969, conspiracy theories about the mission were born. In December of that year, the New York Times published an article with the headline ""A Moon Landing? What Moon Landing?"" about groups of people that claimed the entire thing was a well-orchestrated government hoax.
Since then, hoaxes about the moon landing have taken off. Here at PolitiFact, we've debunked several lunar conspiracies over the years, including that a photo comparison of Armstrong's boots and footprints disproves the event. (That's False.)
Armstrong himself has addressed a wide variety of hoaxes about his achievement, as documented in a 2007 book:
""It would have been harder to fake it than to do it.""
Polling shows the crowd of anti-mooners is small -- just 6% of Americans in 1999 -- but conspiracies have only become more visible in the internet age.
Social media platforms provide ample space for such hoaxes to reach new audiences. Popular YouTubers like Shane Dawson openly question the moon landings, racking up millions of views in the process. Thousands of Facebook users congregate in groups to discuss the latest ""proof"" that the moon landings never happened. There's an entire subreddit dedicated to the hoax.
But who started the Apollo conspiracy in the first place -- and why do people keep sharing them today? PolitiFact went back in time to investigate.
One giant leap for conspiracies
Bill Kaysing is considered to be the granddaddy of moon landing hoaxes.
Kaysing, a former U.S. Navy officer, self-published a book in 1976 titled ""We Never Went to the Moon: America's Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle"" -- four years after the 17th and final Apollo moon landing. In it, he and co-author Randy Reid describe, without evidence, an elaborate government plot to make it look like NASA sent astronauts to the moon when it hadn't.
The basis for their conspiracy goes like this: They say NASA lacked the technical expertise to send someone to the moon, stars don't appear in some lunar photographs, and astronauts wouldn't be able to survive a trip to the moon because of radiation exposure. As PolitiFact and others have pointed out, those kinds of claims don't hold up to independent scrutiny.

Thousands of newsmen and photographers line the banks of a lagoon at the Cape Kennedy Press Site on July 16, 1969, as the Saturn 5 Rocket with Apollo 11 astronauts aboard thunders from its launch pad three and a half miles away. (AP)
""His rationale offered poorly developed logic, sloppily analyzed data and sophomorically argued assertions,"" Roger Launius, former chief historian for NASA, wrote in an article for Smithsonian in May, which summarizes some of the most persistent conspiracies about the Apollo missions.
Kaysing had previously worked as a senior technical writer for Rocketdyne, a company that built the rockets that aided the Apollo space missions. His book was by far the most comprehensive rebuke of the moon landings, laying the groundwork for future hoaxes.
And the time was ripe for them. 
In 1974, Richard Nixon resigned the presidency amid the Watergate scandal, contributing to a decades-long deterioration of public trust in the government. That event, coupled with other crises of the period, at least partially contributed to the spread of hoaxes.
""The initial event occurred around the time that the U.S. was facing significant political disruptions and tragedies: the (Martin Luther) King (Jr.) and (John F.) Kennedy assassinations, the Vietnam War and increasing student unrest,"" said Mark Fenster, a law professor at the University of Florida who has written extensively about conspiracy theories, in an email to PolitiFact. ""As an anomalous event that occurred in the midst of that, the moon landing got swept up in a period of distrust in government.""
The film ""Capricorn One"" in 1977 also provided ammunition for conspiracists, many of whom claimed the moon landing was filmed in a Hollywood studio. The movie focuses on a fictionalized NASA plot to fake a Mars mission.
""Although the director, Peter Hayms, did not believe Apollo had been faked, he was nevertheless fascinated by the notion that such a hoax was possible,"" Andrew Chaikin, an author and science journalist, wrote in the 2007 NASA book. ""Interestingly, he had written the script in 1972 but met strong resistance to the idea in Hollywood. By the late 1970s, when he sold the film, that resistance was gone.""

President Richard Nixon looks at the Apollo 11 astronauts in the isolation unit aboard the USS Hornet after splashdown and recovery, July 24, 1969. (AP)
Then, in 1980, the International Flat Earth Research Society, which falsely claims the Earth is flat instead of spherical, accused NASA of faking the moon landings. The organization claimed, without evidence, that the agency had staged the events in Hollywood with a Walt Disney partnership -- all of which was directed by the famous film director Stanley Kubrick. 
A slate of other conspiracy theorists continued to spread hoaxes throughout the 1980s and 90s, but none achieved the kind of success that Kaysing had. 
In a film titled ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon,"" writer Bart Sibrel claimed to show that ""the Apollo 11 astronauts never actually landed on the moon."" Fox TV broadcasted a similar program the same year titled ""Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land On The Moon?""
To Facebook and beyond
These days, moon landing conspiracists don't broadcast their false beliefs in self-published pamphlets or feature-length documentaries. Instead, they rely on their Instagram feeds and Facebook groups.
Using CrowdTangle, an audience analytics tool, and reverse image searches, PolitiFact tracked down where Facebook users have shared the moon landing hoaxes we've debunked in the past. Examples include that a Chinese rover found no evidence of the American moon landing (Pants on Fire!) and that Aldrin encountered alien life (also Pants on Fire!).
Those conspiracies performed especially well in Facebook groups dedicated to flat-earthers.
In one group we found, which has more than 55,000 members, Apollo conspiracies are fairly popular. When PolitiFact asked the group about their beliefs, or lack thereof, in the moon landing, some pointed to the lack of stars in photos taken on the moon as proof that no one was actually there. (History.com has debunked that notion.)
Then there are entire groups dedicated solely to the moon hoax itself.
In one of the most popular groups we could find, which falsely claims in its bio that the Apollo missions sent unmanned vehicles into space, members regularly share photos, articles and memes that they say help back up their allegations.

(Screenshot from Facebook)
And it's not just Facebook. 
We found the same moon landing hoaxes that we previously debunked on Pinterest and Tumblr, too. A search for ""moon landing hoax"" on Instagram yielded more than 11,000 posts. Then there's YouTube, where a variety of videos contain misinformation -- which are often cross-posted on a subreddit dedicated to the conspiracy. Amazon sells shirts that suggest the Apollo missions were staged.
Why? Ted Goertzel, an emeritus professor of sociology at Rutgers University at Camden, told PolitiFact that it has to do with perceived scientific elitism.
""The moon landing conspiracy theories appeal to people who suspect that they are being manipulated and taken advantage of by a scientific elite,"" he said. ""They are similar in this respect to 9/11 hoax theories, vaccine hoax theories, global warming conspiracy theories and even flat-earth theories.""
But recently, moon landing hoaxes have taken on a more casual tinge. 
The New York Times identified a few online influencers who have given new life to the hoax that the Apollo missions never sent a man to the moon. Shane Dawson has an entire video dedicated to the conspiracy, only to say halfway through that ""it's a theory."" Joe Rogan, a famous stand-up comedian and podcast host, has made similar remarks about conspiracies in the past.
But the internet and social media have also opened up the doors for more debunking of moon landing conspiracies. Clavius.org, an organization of ""amateurs and professionals devoted to the Apollo program,"" regularly debunk hoaxes about the moon landings. Organizations like ours also fact-check such conspiracies, the future reach of which can be decreased through our partnership with Facebook. (Read more about that here.) 
And just because moon landing conspiracies are more accessible today doesn't necessarily mean more people believe them.
""It's not clear to me that social media has changed the narratives or vastly increased the number of believers,"" Fenster said. ""It makes them believable, but just because it's easier to find someone willing to say they believe in the flat earth theory doesn't mean more people believe in it.""

Fact-checking journalism has never been exactly easy. 
Our normal work days include overcoming a series of obstacles: We field questions from readers seeking the facts on topics large and small. We dig for hard-to-find information over the internet and track down experts to interview over the phone. We reach out to press secretaries and spokespeople, seeking their comments and insights. We write the fact-checks and take them through a rigorous editing process with many revisions. We list and link to all of our sources so readers can review our work for themselves. We energetically debate ratings on our Truth-O-Meter. 
After we publish, there's still more debate. Some people agree with our findings, while others let us know exactly why they disagree. The most common criticism is that we were nitpickers, or that we missed the forest for the trees, or that we should have given it a different rating. Others claim we were biased all along, or that fact-checking itself makes no difference anyway.
These critiques and disagreements are not unreasonable. But lately, reasonable disagreement and even hard-charging criticism has evolved into something darker: personal criticism of PolitiFact journalists that can only be described as online harassment and intimidation. 
PolitiFact reporters, like so many others, have been targeted for performing basic practices of journalism. In the spirit of transparency, we wanted to share with our regular readers just a few examples from recent months. (We are purposefully not linking to the examples to avoid amplifying the messages and giving the harassers more attention.)


Reporters have alerted a press secretary that we're writing about their boss and simply asked for comment. Within minutes, she's published the email and slammed the reporters as incompetent, while trying to rally an online mob to attack the reporters -- who are just doing their jobs.


A reporter interviewing a subject was recorded without her knowledge or consent, a potential crime. The interviewee then posted the recording as an example of the reporter's ignorance, bias and general incompetence. Actually, the interview showed a civil and ordinary exchange where the reporter simply sought more information. 


Reporters have been harassed for their physical appearance, with repeated postings of their photos alongside disparaging comments. They've also seen their photos defaced and shared online in disturbing ways.


Reporters were singled out individually as being unfit for their jobs. They've been vilified for not having advanced credentials or specialized academic degrees. (Conversely, they've also been criticized as out-of-touch elites.) They've been told over and over that they should be fired for incompetence. In reality, their credentials are entirely appropriate for journalism, their reporting was factually valid, and the published fact-checks were solid and without error. For the record, they're in zero danger of being fired. 


Yes, journalists have frequently been attacked in the course of American history. Here at PolitiFact, we've received hate mail ever since we started in 2007. What has been different in recent months -- and the reason we're writing this -- is that the latest attacks have been intensely personalized and aimed at specific journalists, with the apparent intention of intimidating and isolating individual members of our team. 
The presumable end goal is that reporters will pull their punches or leave journalism altogether. The most viciously targeted staffers have been younger and people of color. But make no mistake, older white men with years in the business have been targeted for malicious harassment as well.
One of PolitiFact's primary attackers of late has been Dan Bongino, a talk show host popular on social media. His chief talking points are conspiracy theories that the 2020 election was stolen and attacks on COVID-19 prevention measures such as masking. It's not really a surprise that he hates fact-checkers; he's said it's an insult to be called a journalist. Bongino's criticism of us have come after we fact-check his posts through Facebook's third-party fact-checking program; that program works to reduce the influence of posts that include misinformation and conspiracy theories.  
Like many other online attackers, Bongino has misrepresented our findings, the scope of our reporting, and the points our fact-checks have made. He's also falsely described corrections we've made after publication as proof of the illegitimacy of our work. The truth is that every reputable news organization makes corrections in order to ensure that their reports are as complete and accurate as possible. PolitiFact has a published corrections policy and will continue to make corrections as part of our normal work process.  
More concerningly, Bongino has egged on and been egged on by a more traditional figure: the press secretary for the governor of Florida. Those outside of Florida political circles may not have heard of Christina Pushaw. Rather than responding to journalists' press inquiries in a standard manner, Pushaw will attack them on Twitter, urging online mobs to vilify things that are legitimate practices of journalism. She tells others not to respond to our requests for comment and has falsely suggested that reporters said things they didn't. 
When the government itself tries to delegitimize journalists, it's a warning sign that they may soon take more concrete steps against independent journalism. Yes, that would be unconstitutional, but we've seen many constitutional norms suffer in recent days.
The actions of these anti-journalism forces are deeply concerning to everyone who cares about the independent practice of fact-finding. Disparagement of individual journalists has become an occupational hazard for PolitiFact's staff and among journalists at media organizations around the country. 
At PolitiFact, we've taken steps to help our journalists weather these unfair attacks with their sanity and dignity intact. We remind them that they have the support of our entire fact-checking organization and of our parent organization the Poynter Institute. We help them take breaks from social media to recharge and regroup. We connect them with peers who have suffered the same attacks and persevered. We take additional steps depending on the severity and specifics of each unique situation.
We've written this very report so that our readers and the world know that our journalists have our complete support, and that we proudly stand by their work. 
Our readers remain a huge source of solace in the face of online attacks. Many of them support us financially with monthly donations. They share our reports online and publicly comment that they appreciate our work. Others contact us directly with simple words of support sent via email or on social media. We are here to serve those who seek fact-based, civil expression. Disagreement is fine. Personal, ugly attacks are shameful -- and won't discourage us from our work. 
Our readers regularly tell us that they believe in what we're doing. They say they appreciate the research we do to understand the reality of what is happening in our country, and that we help them navigate the nuances of consuming news. They tell us fact-checking is critical to a functioning democracy, and they appreciate that at PolitiFact, the truth matters. 
These are the ordinary Americans we're fact-checking for. And no amount of online harassment or intimidation will stop us.

296.PhotosshowformerPresidentBarackObamaactinginappropriatelywithachild,"
A collage of three images being shared on Facebook suggest that former President Barack Obama was caught acting inappropriately with a child. But that's not the case, and such claims feed into a bigger, unfounded conspiracy pushed by QAnon that he and other powerful people are part of a global child sex-trafficking ring. 
One of the photos shows a child who appears to be bound and gagged with tape. Obama is not in this picture. 
Another shows a grid of smaller shots of Obama and the actor George Clooney on a boat with a child. The words, ""exposing herself"" and an arrow have been scribbled in red on top of one of the images.. 
The third shows Obama with his arms wrapped around a young child who is smiling while seated on his lap.

We don't know the origins of the first image, though as early as 2017 it appeared online in connection with a hoax about dead Malaysian children found without organs. 
We've already fact-checked claims about the photo of Obama and Clooney, which was taken on Lake Como in 2019. Though the angle of the photo only shows the two men and a girl, other photos from that day reveal there were many people aboard, including Michelle Obama, Amal Clooney, the president's daughter, Malia, and other guests. Several media outlets covered the boat ride and nothing nefarious was reported. 
The third image was taken in 2015 by Pete Souza, the White House photographer during the Obama administration. The caption: ""The President snuggles with his niece Savita Ng, after his sister Maya Soetoro-Ng, and her family dropped by the Oval Office.""
The Baltimore Sun among other news organizations published the image, and Souza posted it on Medium. 
By posting these images of Obama in connection with a photo that's hard to look at -- of a child seemingly in distress -- innocuous photos of the former president take on a new, insidious meaning. But claims connecting him to sexual misconduct with children are completely baseless. This post is consistent with a wide-ranging QAnon conspiracy theory that falsely claims that a cabal of prominent Democrats and movie stars are Satan-worshipping pedophiles.

A video spreading widely on Facebook opens with a fake Time magazine cover showing Barack Obama and then piles on more misinformation about the former president over more than four minutes.
""Time is up"" and ""Treason"" appear as headlines on the supposed cover of the magazine, and there's a partial headline that's cut off: ""How former president Barack Obama was the kingpin of the biggest political scandal in modern..."" 
This post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
We reviewed Time covers from 2008, when Obama was elected, to date and found no cover matching the image in the video. 
The video goes on to share more fake images of the president among unfounded claims. 
About 17 seconds into the video, one photo has been edited to show Obama wearing a turban while standing next to Osama bin Laden. In the original image, released by Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in February 2008, Obama was dressed as a Somali elder by Sheikh Mahmed Hassan, who is standing next to Obama during his visit to northeastern Kenya. 
The next image in the video shows former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Clinton and Obama all posing separately with bin Laden. We've already fact-checked those photos -- they're fake. 
About 45 seconds into the video, an image of Obama and Clinton appears with this text: ""They paid a foreign government to falsify information, than lied to the courts to spy and overthrow Trump. Democrats lied and impeached Trump to hide their crimes."" 
This touches on other claims we've already checked. 
After Trump won the Republican nomination, the Democratic National Committee hired an opposition firm called Fusion GPS to collect information on him. Fusion GPS then hired former British spy Christopher Steele to produce memos on Trump's ties to Russia. He wrote a dossier that included salacious but unverified claims about Trump.

About a minute and 11 seconds into the video, a photo of Obama appears with the names ""Jean Paul Ludwig"" and ""Barry Soetoro"" and a Social Security number. These refer to inaccurate claims that Obama's real name is Barry Soetoro and that Obama has illegally been using the Social Security number of a dead man, Ludwig. 
The video also uses imagery and slogans associated with the wide-ranging QAanon conspiracy, which asserts without evidence that Trump is fighting against a deep-state cabal of pedophiles seeking to overthrow the president. About a minute and 45 seconds in, it claims that Obama helped ""plan a coup"" and that he should ""pay the price"" for treason. 
After that, another fake image appears, showing Obama kissing David Cameron, Britain's former prime minister. 
Later in the video, a photo of former presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama appears and perpetuates the conspiracy theory that mass shootings in the United States are orchestrated by the government to achieve its policy agenda. 
""Trump is sending us all to Gitmo for life,"" Clinton appears to be saying in the image. 
""Let's plan another mass shooting,"" Bush says. 
""We can't,"" Obama responds, ""all the restaurants and theaters are closed."" 
Toward the end of the video, yet another doctored image appears. Snopes checked this one -- it appears to show Russian President Vladimir Putin pulling Obama's tie, but that didn't happen.

198.BUSTEDCDCInflatedCOVIDNumbersAccusedofViolatingFederalLaw,"
On Feb. 4, U.S. coronavirus deaths exceeded 450,000. According to some social media users, the official death toll can't be trusted.
One blog post shared thousands of times on social media claims official COVID-19 data is being inflated. 
""BUSTED: CDC Inflated COVID Numbers, Accused of Violating Federal Law,"" reads the headline on a National File post.
The claim was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The post that follows the National File's headline claims that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has inflated COVID-19 fatality data.
""CDC illegally inflated the COVID fatality number by at least 1,600 percent as the 2020 presidential election played out, according to a study published by the Public Health Initiative of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge,"" the blog post reads.
This is not the first time coronavirus death statistics have been the focus of online misinformation. PolitiFact and other fact-checking organizations have debunked prior claims that the CDC decreased the number of coronavirus deaths from 153,504 to 9,210.  
And despite what the blog post claims, there is still no evidence to suggest the CDC is inflating coronavirus mortality data. 
The study that the blog post points to as its primary evidence was produced by a private group called the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge. PolitiFact has previously fact-checked a false claim by the institute's leader James Lyons-Weiler. A study published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information also debunked Lyons-Weiler's claim that the virus behind the ongoing pandemic was created in a lab.
In this case, the study does not definitively say that the CDC inflated COVID-19 deaths. Rather, it calls into question guidelines the CDC issued in March 2020 that were designed to more accurately capture mortality data related to the coronavirus. The study's authors called the guidance ""a capricious alteration to data collection has compromised the accuracy, quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of their published data."" 
The study's conclusions are carefully worded (with boldface added by PolitiFact for emphasis):

According to International Olympic Committee data, ""an average of 29 athletes under the age of 35 suffered sudden death per year from 1966 to 2004. From March 2021 to March 2022, 769 athletes have died or suffered cardiac arrest.""












By Samantha Putterman * June 23, 2022







""It is concerning that the CDC may have willfully failed to collect, analyze, and publish accurate data used by elected officials to develop public health policy for a nation in crisis [...] If the data being reported was indeed compromised by the CDC's perplexing decision to abandon proven data collection and reporting practices in favor of untested methods, then all public health policies based upon these inaccurate data must be reexamined."" 
Ultimately, the study's ten authors -- at least one of whom is not a medical expert -- conclude that ""further federal investigation is justified."" They do not prove or conclude that the CDC inflated COVID-19 death data or violated federal laws.
Additionally, experts who study the data say that it is far more likely that official counts of coronavirus deaths are too low. 
In April 2020, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, weighed in on the allegation that the coronavirus death toll was being inflated because people were actually dying of other conditions.
""There is absolutely no evidence that that's the case at all,"" Fauci said in an NBC News interview. ""I think it falls under the category of something that's very unfortunate -- these conspiracy theories that we hear about."" 
Fauci went on to say he thought it was possible COVID-19 deaths were being undercounted.
""I think there's more of a chance of missing some [deaths] that are really coronavirus deaths,"" he said. ""But I don't think that number is significant enough to really substantially modify the trends that we're seeing at all.""
Roderick Little, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Michigan, told PolitiFact that ""a more reliable picture"" of the coronavirus death toll could be seen by ""looking at excess death rates over historical patterns, as on the same date in previous years.""
""If anything, I'd expect the CDC numbers to be underestimates, not overestimates,"" Little said. ""I note that the lack of testing for COVID early in the pandemic would contribute to such an underestimate.""
Our ruling
A blog post headline reads, ""BUSTED: CDC Inflated COVID Numbers, Accused of Violating Federal Law."" 
There is no evidence to suggest that the CDC has inflated the number of U.S. coronavirus deaths. In fact, experts agree it is more likely that coronavirus deaths are being undercounted.

""Biden's Air Force One is not the same as Trump's Air Force One,"" reads the title of a video published Feb. 6 on Bitchute, which shows the photos of the different planes sandwiched between graphics that show the word ""LIE"" stamped across headlines declaring ""Biden Wins.""

These posts imply that Biden is not flying on Air Force One because he is not the real commander-in-chief, furthering a baseless conspiracy theory that the November election was not legitimate.
This theory is not based in fact, and it rests on a flawed understanding of Air Force One. 
Air Force One isn't the name of a particular plane. It's the air traffic control sign designating any Air Force aircraft carrying the president. In other words, any Air Force plane carrying the president is called Air Force One. 
There are two types of planes typically designated for carrying the president: a Boeing VC-25A and a Boeing C-32. The VC-25A is the iconic military plane most commonly associated with Air Force One, while the C-32 is typically used for shorter domestic flights and flights to small airports that can't support the much larger VC-25A.

The Pentagon ""finally comes clean"" and ""admits...that there are 46 U.S. military-funded biolabs in Ukraine""












By Samantha Putterman * June 15, 2022







Biden's flight from Washington, D.C. to Delaware lasted only 25 minutes, so he took the C-32 plane. Images from Feb. 5 show him disembarking from the plane at Wilmington Airport. 
Former President Donald Trump was frequently filmed and photographed taking the C-32 plane as well. So was President Barack Obama. 
Joe Biden is the president of the United States. He was duly inaugurated as the 46th U.S. president on Jan. 20. The day's events were witnessed and documented by elected officials, former presidents, military members, reporters, photographers and performers. They were also broadcast and live-streamed by several outlets including ABC, CNN, C-SPAN, Fox News, NBC and PBS. 
Our ruling
Posts claim that ""Biden's Air Force One is not the same as Trump's Air Force One,"" which means that Biden is not the real president. 
Any Air Force plane transporting the president is designated with the Air Force One call sign. 
On a trip to Delaware, Biden took a small plane the president uses for short domestic flights and flights to small airports. Trump also took that plane when he was president.
These posts are inaccurate and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

In March 2017, anti-vaccination blogs presented misleading reports concerning a pair of rejected motions that month by the Swedish parliament, also known as the Riksdagen.
Frequent purveyors of conspiracy theories and fake news such as YourNewsWire.com reported variations of the following:
The Swedish Riksdagen (parliament) rejected seven motions on May 10 that would have enshrined forced vaccinations into law, stating ""It would violate our [Swedish Constitution] if we introduced compulsory vaccinations, or mandatory vaccinations.""
Noting also the ""massive resistance (by Swedes) to all forms of coercion with regard to vaccinations"", the Riksdag also made reference to ""frequent serious adverse reactions"" in children who receive vaccinations.
A spokesperson for the Public Health Agency of Sweden, the Folkhalsomyndigheten, told us via email on 30 March 2018 that only two -- not seven -- motions proposing a mandatory vaccination program were rejected in 2017. They added that the proposals were not rejected because vaccinations would be ""harmful,"" but because ""all health care in Sweden, including vaccination programs, is voluntary.""
Conspiracy theory blogs also reported that the Riksdagen ""banned"" mandatory vaccinations. What it did not mention is that the country's voluntary vaccination program, which covers ten diseases, already dates back decades.
While Sweden's program is voluntary, the vast majority of children are still vaccinated; the Folkhalsomyndigheten spokesperson told us, ""More than 97 percent of the 2 year olds have been vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella, for example."" Overall, however, the country experienced an increase in measles cases in 2017. The European Centers for Disease Control reported that Sweden was one of 18 nations where the number of cases reported during the first half of 2017 exceeded that of the same period a year earlier.
YourNewsWire.com and similar blogs sourced their stories from a report from an ""alternative health"" group, the National Health Federation. However, this group has come under its share of scrutiny and criticism. For example, the American Cancer Society excoriated the group in a report concerning ""unproven methods"" of managing the disease, saying:
After study of the literature and other available information, the American Cancer Society has found no evidence that methods of treatment promoted by the National Health Federation (NHF) result in objective benefit in the treatment of cancer in human beings. Lacking such evidence, the American Cancer Society strongly urges individuals with cancer not to seek treatment based on the recommendations of the NHF.

A lengthy Facebook post supposedly written by Liz Crokin that recounted the various good deeds performed by Donald Trump before he became president of the United States is frequently circulated on social media.
The post starts:
TRUMP DOES THE UNTHINKABLE. by Liz Crokin
As an entertainment journalist, I've had the opportunity to cover Trump for over a decade, and in all my years covering him I've never heard anything negative about the man until he announced he was running for president. Keep in mind, I got paid a lot of money to dig up dirt on celebrities like Trump for a living so a scandalous story on the famous billionaire could've potentially sold a lot of magazines and would've been a Huge feather in my cap.
Instead, I found that he doesn't drink alcohol or do drugs, he's a hardworking businessman. On top of that, he's one of the most generous celebrities in the world with a heart filled with more gold than his $100 million New York penthouse.
Since the media has failed so miserably at reporting the truth about Trump, I decided to put together some of the acts of kindness he's committed over three decades which has gone virtually unnoticed or fallen on deaf ears.
This opinion piece was truly written by Crokin. The original article was published on the conservative website Townhall in July 2016. There are a few small changes between the viral Facebook posts and the original article -- for instance, the Townhall version includes a different introductory sentence -- but the Facebook version is largely a verbatim reproduction of the Townhall piece.
It should be noted that while Crokin may have been accurately described as an ""entertainment journalist"" when this piece was first published in 2016, she has spent the last few years supporting and spreading QAnon conspiracy theories. 
Furthermore, the content of this piece contains a mixture of truth and fiction. We've covered many of the topics mentioned in Crokin's opinion piece in further detail in the following investigations regarding Trump's alleged good deeds: So You Think You Know the Real Donald Trump? and Donald Trump's 'Quiet Acts of Random Kindness.'
While some of the stories about Trump's good deeds are undeniably true (Trump truly lent his personal plane to the family of a 3-year-old in need of urgent medical care), these lists also often contain falsehoods. In Crokin's piece, for example, she included a false story about Trump sending his personal plane to rescue 200 stranded marines in 1991, and another fictitious anecdote about Trump paying off a person's mortgage after they helped him when he was having car trouble.
To sum it up: A former entertainment journalist and current QAnon conspiracy theorist penned an article in 2016 entitled ""Trump Does the Unthinkable"" that contained a mixture of true and false stories about various good deeds allegedly performed by Trump before his presidency.

In the 2020 election, 3,385,294 votes were cast for president in Arizona, and Donald Trump lost the state to Joe Biden by just 10,457 votes -- 49.36% to 49.06%.
Six months later, a livestreamed but opaque audit of ballots from the state's most populous county is under way in a 14,870-seat arena. And posts on social media falsely suggest that the audit showed Trump was overtaking Biden. 
A widely shared Instagram post claimed:
""Preliminary audit showed Trump ahead by 250,000. Now as it nears completion nearly 950,000 ballots are declared illegal. Nearly all for Biden."" 
The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
""There's no preliminary results,"" Ken Bennett, Arizona's former secretary of state and a liaison for the Senate Republicans who ordered the audit, told PolitiFact on May 6. ""There's no such finding. There's been no findings released to either of those effects.""
The audit, begun April 23, will likely to continue for at least 60 days, Bennett said. He added that under the contract for the audit, no preliminary findings are to be released.
A spokesperson for the audit did not reply to our email.
Final official results of the November election showed Biden beat Trump in Maricopa County, 1,040,774 votes to 995,665, or by about 2% of the vote.

By Grace Abels * June 14, 2022







So the Instagram claim would have you believe that the audit found roughly 90% of Biden's votes were ""illegal.""
Fallout since the election
The Maricopa audit was ordered up by Republican state senators, even though the original result has been validated by a hand-count sample audit and a forensic audit of tabulation equipment that found no abnormalities.
The GOP hired a team that included Cyber Ninjas, a Florida-based technology company lacking election audit experience. Cyber Ninjas is headed by Doug Logan, who promoted ""stop the steal"" conspiracy theories about the election that culminated in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. 
The conservative One America News Network, which has aired falsehoods about the 2020 election, set up a nine-camera livestream for the audit, which is being conducted at Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix. But Cyber Ninja's policies and procedures were released only after a judge ruled that the firm couldn't keep them secret. Reporters initially were restricted from taking notes or filing reports.
The false claim follows others that we've debunked about purported findings from the audit. We rated False a widely shared Facebook claim that the audit found ""a quarter of a million illegal votes,"" given that no results have been released.
We also rated False a claim that the audit ""is confirming the rumors that real ballots have a special watermark."" There's no evidence of any such finding, and Maricopa County says it does not use watermarks on its ballots.
Our ruling
A widely shared social media post claimed that an ongoing audit of the 2020 presidential election in Arizona ""showed Trump ahead by 250,000"" votes, and ""nearly 950,000 ballots are declared illegal, nearly all for Biden.""
No findings have been released from an ongoing audit of the 2020 presidential election in Maricopa County, Ariz., that is being conducted by firms hired by Arizona Senate Republicans.
There is no evidence that the audit has turned up any illegal ballots or changes in votes that would give Trump the lead in Arizona. The claim, with its sky-high figures, is false and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire!

91.NoElonMuskDidntTweet,"
On June 4, 2021, an image supposedly showing a screenshot of a message posted by SpaceX founder Elon Musk, in which he cryptically spells out ""I Miss You Ghislaine"" in an acrostic code, was shared on social media:

This is not a genuine message posted by Musk. 
We searched archived versions of Musk's timeline for this message, but were unable to find any traces of this tweet. It's also unlikely that this message was posted and then deleted, as we were unable to find any retweets containing broken links for this message. Musk has more than 50 million followers on Twitter and his account is a frequent source for news. Yet, we have not seen any credible reports that this message was actually posted to his account. 
This image appears to have been created as a hoax in order to connect Musk to Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite currently awaiting trial on charges that she recruited young girls for Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring. Critics of Musk like to point out that the SpaceX CEO was once pictured with Maxwell.  






While there is a genuine photograph of Musk with Maxwell that was taken at a 2014 Vanity Fair Oscars after-party, Musk has denied that he knows the accused sex trafficker. 

In addition to playing on conspiracy theories about Musk and Maxwell, the fake ""I Miss You Ghislaine"" tweet appears to be mocking a genuine tweet Musk posted on June 3 in which he seemingly spelled the word ""cum"" in acrostic code by posting the words ""Canada,"" ""USA"" and ""Mexico"" one after the other:

The ""Canada,"" ""USA,"" ""Mexico"" tweet is real. The ""I Miss You Ghislaine"" tweet is not.

29.MemeRecyclesConspira,"



Quick Take
A baseless conspiracy theory on Facebook suggests that the California wildfires were started by a ""powerful laser."" The meme spreading the theory uses the same photos that circulated in 2018 to advance a similar claim.

Full Story 
Facebook users are sharing a meme that recycles a conspiracy theory about California wildfires, and pulls out old photos to do so.
An Aug. 25 post shared by 10,000 users is suggesting that the wildfires -- which officials have attributed to lightning, a heat wave and dry conditions -- were started by ""powerful lasers.""
""All of these images were captured during the wildfires in California,"" the meme reads. ""Is this evidence that powerful lasers were used to cause these fires?""
No, it's not.
The images are actually the same ones that were shared on Twitter in November 2018 by Michael Coudrey, a conservative social media voice whose old Twitter account used the name ""Mike Tokes.""
At the time, a similar conspiracy theory was being spread through YouTube videos, as the Daily Beast reported then. The theory claimed that laser-caused fires were making way for a high-speed rail system.
So, for starters, none of the pictures are from the current wildfires in California.
Coudrey's 2018 tweet described the photos in question as ""[u]ser submitted photos on Facebook of the California fires"" that ""show weird beams of light emiting from the sky causing fires, destruction & property damage.""

Here's some background we found on each of the four photos used in the meme:

The first photo, on the left in the meme, is from SpaceX's May 2018 launch of a rocket, Falcon 9.
The photo on the bottom in the middle is from the U.S. Forest Service of Klamath National Forest and was taken of a fire in northern California in May 2018. The agency later responded to Twitter users questioning the photo and noted that what has been misperceived as a beam was actually lens flare.
Above that photo is an image that has been around since January 2018 and was circulated to suggest that a meteor in Michigan was actually an energy weapon attack. A report from Snopes at the time noted that an oil refinery in Ohio conducted a controlled fire around the same time, which some had evidently tried to link to the meteor.
The fourth image, on the right, has appeared on blog posts that suggest ""direct energy weapons"" were behind the Woolsey fire in California in November 2018. A utility company whose equipment is believed to have been responsible for igniting the fire reached a settlement last year with Los Angeles County and other public agencies over the blaze.

In short, as we said, none of the photos in the meme are recent images from the California wildfires, and there's no evidence that any of the fires were caused by ""powerful lasers.""
Officials have said lightning, plus the extreme heat and dry conditions, are to blame for the fires.
According to CAL FIRE, California's fire authority, there have been nearly 14,000 lightning strikes since Aug. 15. Since then, there have been more than 700 new wildfires, which have collectively burned more than 1.32 million acres. There are seven reported fatalities, and nearly 1,700 structures have been destroyed.
The National Park Service has estimated that 10% of all wildfires in the U.S. are caused by lightning strikes.

96.DidJamesClapperOutBa,"
A video circulated on social media in October 2019 bore a misleading caption: ""James Clapper Outs Barack Obama as Mastermind Behind Russia Hoax.""
The caption accompanied a video of former U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper in an interview with CNN, discussing the Trump administration's decision to investigate the origins of inquiries into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The video appeared to have been uploaded to a video-sharing blog platform.
Clapper did not say what the video caption claimed: He did not ""out"" Obama as the ""mastermind"" behind the ""Russia hoax."" Clapper instead aired his dismay at the turn of events in which Obama's successor, Donald Trump, had essentially compelled the government to launch an investigation into its own findings that the Kremlin had manipulated the 2016 presidential election.
The original CNN video can be viewed by following this link. Here is a transcript of the exchange between Clapper and CNN host Jim Sciutto:

SCIUTTO: As you know, the president now has sitting members of this government. You have the attorney general traveling the world now, meeting with U.S. intelligence partners, trying to find out, in his view, whether they participated in some sort of Obama administration-led effort to undermine President Trump in the last election here. You also know that John Durham, who is a former prosecutor, senior Justice Department official, he's pursuing his own investigation on the origins of that probe. Are you concerned that Barr's or Durham's investigation will find wrongdoing and seek to punish former intelligence officials?
CLAPPER: Well, I don't know, I don't think there was any wrongdoing. I think at the time all of us were trying to navigate a very, very difficult, politically fraught, highly-charged situation. I know for my part, my main concern was, were the Russians, and the threat posed by the Russians to our very political fabric. And the message I'm getting from all this is, apparently what we were supposed to have done was to ignore the Russian interference, ignore the Russian meddling and the threat that it poses to us, and oh by the way, blowing off what the then-commander-in-chief, President Obama, told us to do, which was to assemble all the reporting that we could, that we had available to us and put it in one report that the president could pass on to the Congress and to the next administration. And, while we're at it, declassify as much as we possibly could to make it public. And that's what we did. And it's kind of disconcerting now to be investigated for having done our duty and done what we were told to do by the president. 






Multiple investigations have concluded that Russians interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and that their activities were aimed at helping Donald Trump to get elected. Even though Trump repeatedly called those investigations ""witch hunts,"" he appeared to admit in May 2019 to at least knowing that Russians had interfered in the election:

Russia, Russia, Russia! That's all you heard at the beginning of this Witch Hunt Hoax...And now Russia has disappeared because I had nothing to do with Russia helping me to get elected. It was a crime that didn't exist. So now the Dems and their partner, the Fake News Media,.....
-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2019

Trump and his supporters, however, have undertaken an aggressive campaign to discredit investigations that have concluded the Russians interfered in the 2016 election with the aim of helping Trump win, to the extent that Trump has leveraged his own administration to investigate the inquiry that led to that finding.
In October 2019 President Trump was facing an impeachment inquiry over a phone call he had with the Ukrainian president, with Trump being accused of holding back key military aid in exchange for Ukraine's assistance in obtaining damaging information about a Trump political rival. But in that call, Trump also asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into a debunked conspiracy theory positing that the hacked Democratic National Committee server from 2016 was in Ukraine -- a conspiracy theory that exculpates the Russians in the hacking operation.
In other words, the Obama administration conducted an investigation based on evidence which led to the conclusion that Russians had manipulated the 2016 presidential election. To say Obama was the ""mastermind"" of a ""hoax"" amounts to political propaganda favoring Trump while distorting reality.

271.IsTetanusVaccineSpik,"
In October 2014, a group of concerned Catholic bishops in Kenya released a statement claiming a tetanus vaccine program aimed at women entering or in their childbearing years was in actuality a stealth attempt to sterilize women en masse for unstated reasons.
Among questions raised by the group in its statement about the tetanus vaccine campaign in Kenya were why the vaccines were considered necessary if no ""tetanus crisis in Kenya"" had been declared, why the vaccine was offered primarily to women between the ages of 14 and 49, why boys and men were not targeted by the campaign, and why tetanus was ""prioritized"" over other illnesses affecting citizens of Kenya:
We are not convinced that the government has taken adequate responsibility to ensure that Tetanus Toxoid vaccine (TT) laced with Beta human chorionic gonadotropin (b-HCG) sub unit is not being used by the sponsoring development partners. This has previously been used by the same partners in Philippines, Nicaragua and Mexico to vaccinate women against future pregnancy. Beta HCG sub unit is a hormone necessary for pregnancy.
When injected as a vaccine to a non-pregnant woman, this Beta HCG sub unit combined with tetanus toxoid develops antibodies against tetanus and HCG so that if a woman's egg becomes fertilized, her own natural HCG will be destroyed rendering her permanently infertile. In this situation tetanus vaccination has been used as a birth control method.
We retain that the tetanus vaccination campaign bears the hallmarks of the programmes that were carried out in Philippines, Mexico and Nicaragua. We would want to participate in ensuring that the vaccines to be administered are free of this hormone.
A Catholic doctors' group in Kenya echoed the concerns of the bishops, and an anti-abortion site quoted Dr. Muhame Ngare of the Mercy Medical Centre in Nairobi as saying:
We sent six samples from around Kenya to laboratories in South Africa. They tested positive for the HCG antigen. They were all laced with HCG.
This proved right our worst fears; that this WHO campaign is not about eradicating neonatal tetanus but a well-coordinated forceful population control mass sterilization exercise using a proven fertility regulating vaccine. This evidence was presented to the Ministry of Health before the third round of immunization but was ignored. 






Dr. Collins Tabu, the head of immunization at Kenya's Health Ministry, refuted the claim and said women immunized under the program in recent years subsequently conceived, prompting Dr. Ngare to respond with:
Either we are lying or the government is lying. But ask yourself, 'What reason do the Catholic doctors have for lying?' The Catholic Church has been here in Kenya providing health care and vaccinating for 100 years for longer than Kenya has existed as a country.
Usually we give a series three shots over two to three years, we give it anyone who comes into the clinic with an open wound, men, women or children. If this is intended to inoculate children in the womb, why give it to girls starting at 15 years? You cannot get married till you are 18.
Dr. Ngare's forced choice between the doctors or the Kenyan government neglects a third possibility: someone, somewhere is sincere but mistaken. His statement about the timing of vaccinations in respect to the earliest age women can marry in Kenya is a good illustration of fallacious thinking -- since the vaccine is given in a five-shot series, beginning administration three years prior to marrying age makes more sense than exposing women who are married but not yet immunized to losing children to tetanus.
The expressed concerns of Ngare and bishops in Kenya are the same as false rumors circulated over two decades ago in several other countries (Mexico, Tanzania, Nicaragua, and the Philippines) where the WHO and UNICEF undertook tetanus vaccination programs:
Rumours have circulated recently in Mexico, Tanzania, Nicaragua, and the Philippines that WHO and UNICEF are using women as guinea pigs to test a contraceptive vaccine given to them under the guide of tetanus toxoid vaccine. These rumours, apparently initiated by so-called 'pro-life' groups, are completely untrue. The vaccines do not contain contraceptive vaccines of any other substance which interferes with fertility of pregnancy and their labeling accurately describes their actual contents. The false claims made by these groups have had an adverse impact on immunisation programmes in all four countries.
These rumors (and similar ones concerning polio vaccination programs) have several aspects, one being the focus on women of childbearing age in Kenya. Neonatal tetanus resulted in the deaths of 550 Kenyan babies in 2013, and according to UNICEF, 58,000 babies worldwide died of neonatal tetanus in 2010 (a count that includes only known tetanus deaths). The organization explained the necessity of tetanus immunization in countries such as Kenya, and how the scope of the problem could be even larger than has been recorded to date:
Maternal and neonatal tetanus represents a very high proportion of the total tetanus disease burden due mainly to inadequate immunization services, limited or absent clean delivery services and improper post-partum cord care. The majority of mothers and newborns dying of tetanus live in Africa and Southern and East Asia, generally in areas where women are poor, have little access to health care, and have little information about safe delivery practices.
Once the disease is contracted, the fatality rate can be as high as 100% without hospital care and between 10% to 60% with hospital care. The true extent of the tetanus death toll is not known as many newborns and mothers die at home and neither the birth nor the death is reported.
That information was echoed in an interview with James Elder, UNICEF's Chief of Communications for East Africa, by the Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute (C-Fam):
C-Fam: Are WHO and UNICEF experimenting with hCG vaccines in Kenya?
Elder: No.
The aim of the vaccination is to eliminate neonatal tetanus in Kenya through vaccination campaigns in districts that have been identified as at high risk for maternal and neonatal tetanus.
C-Fam: Why would only the female population of child bearing age be targeted for this specific tetanus vaccination program?
Elder: The aim of the vaccination campaign is to prevent neonatal tetanus in newborns who are the most vulnerable and bear the highest burden of tetanus disease. These children live in the parts of the country with limited access to health facilities -- most births occur at home in unhygienic conditions. Some of the babies are born to girls as young as 15 years old from communities living in marginalized areas. Children born at home under unhygienic conditions are at risk of tetanus infection through the cut umbilical cord. Their mothers are also at risk of infection with tetanus infection during childbirth.
Vaccinating girls and women of child bearing age (15 to 49 years) accords protection to the women even if they deliver at home in unhygienic conditions. They pass this protection to the unborn child in the womb. For the babies born to women who have received the required doses of the vaccine this protection from tetanus lasts for a few weeks after birth. That is why they have to get TT vaccine again through the routine immunization programme.
C-Fam: Why does the Tetanus vaccine require 5 doses, when usually tetanus vaccination only requires one shot every 5 to 10 years?
Elder: During vaccination campaigns that aim to protect newborns living in areas with limited access to health facilities, 3 doses are administered. The second dose after 1 month or soon thereafter and the third dose after 6 months. The 3 doses provide protection for 5 years. These are additional doses as most people have received some TT vaccine when they cut themselves or during visits to Antenatal clinics when pregnant. Five doses are recommended in the Kenya Vaccination policy to anyone (male or female) as it offers protection against tetanus for life. 






Another aspect of the debate concerns contraceptive vaccines, a medical initiative that has long been in the testing phase. However, the Catholic bishops in Kenya are not claiming that Kenyan women are being given the equivalent of a contraceptive vaccine (something which in current form would have to be readministered every few months to be effective), but rather are being sterilized through the injection of a substance (b-HCG) that renders them permanently infertile.
The Kenya Catholic Doctors Association claimed they had tested samples of the tetanus vaccine used in Kenya and found them to be laced with (b-HCG) (a component of experimental birth control vaccines), but UNICEF noted that there was no laboratory in Kenya capable of making an accurate analysis of that nature:
The tests were done in hospital laboratories in Kenya. The staff in these laboratories could not however tell whether the samples were vaccines or not, as this was not declared to the testing laboratories by the Catholic Doctors Association. The laboratories tested the samples for hCG using analyzers used for testing human samples like blood and urine for pregnancy. There is no laboratory in Kenya with the capacity to test non-human samples like vaccine for hCG.
Again, this aspect of the claim perfectly mirrors similar rumors spread decades earlier during the course of tetanus vaccination programs in several other countries:
After these rumours were spread, attempts were made to analyse TT vaccines for the presence of hCG. The vaccines were sent to hospital laboratories and tested using pregnancy test kits which are developed for use on serum and urine specimens, and are not appropriate for a vaccine such as TT, which contains a special preservative (merthiolate) and an adjuvant (aluminum salt). As a consequence of using these inappropriate tests, low levels of hCG-like activity were found in some samples of TT vaccine. The laboratories themselves recognised the insignificance of the results, which were below the reliable detection capability of the kits and were due to a nonspecific interaction between the adjuvant or other substances in the vaccine and the test kit. However, these results were misrepresented by the 'pro-life' groups with the resulting disruption of immunisation campaigns.
When the vaccines were tested in laboratories which used properly validated test systems, the results clearly showed that the vaccines did not contain hCG. The low levels of hCG-like activity seen in some samples were the result of false positive reactions. In fact, in a laboratory in Hungary, it was shown that the sterile water supply from the local hospital gave a higher false positive level of hCG than did the TT vaccine.
The conspiracy theory that Kenya's tetanus vaccination program is actually aimed at sterilization, not vaccination, has had staying power long after the original controversy passed. This is, in part, thanks to one of the companies tasked to perform analyses by the Catholic Doctors Association losing their laboratory accreditation years after the fact.
In December 2016, a company that had been involved in efforts to test the tetanus vaccine -- Agriq-Quest -- was audited by both the Kenya Accreditation Service (KENAS) and the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC). That audit resulted in Agri-Quest losing its laboratory accreditation. A former employee who resigned from Agriq-Quest told Business Daily Africa in January 2017 that the lab had been claiming to perform analyses they were not capable of performing:

A former employee at Agriq-Quest who requested anonymity for fear of victimisation claimed that the lab lacked capacity to carry out the tests it was handling for its clients, including the Ministry of Health [...].

Agriq-Quest, however, claimed through an attorney that their loss of accreditation came as a result of more nefarious reasons -- the government hadn't paid them for analyses they performed on behalf of the Ministry of Health and The Catholic Doctors Association because the Ministry wanted them to doctor their results:

Agriq-Quest, through their lawyer Gitobu Imanyara, last year claimed that the government had not paid them Sh13.8 million for tests performed on controversial tetanus and polio vaccines.
They claimed that the government's decision was as a result of the company's refusal to doctor results in favour on the Ministry of Health which had jointly asked for the analysis with the Catholic Church.
The company's results from tests carried out on the vials showed that the samples of the vaccines were contaminated as had been claimed by the Catholic Church and Agriq-Quest claimed the government wanted the results altered to show that they were fit to be administered to women and children.

While no evidence has been offered to suggest that narrative was anything other than a desperate PR move by a business whose accreditation had been revoked, the claim of a government's mandating doctored results to sell a secret sterilization program has not been ignored by conspiracy minded websites such as Your News Wire, which continued to promote Agriq-Quest's claims as recently as February 2018.
Despite such claims, no compelling evidence exists that the tetanus vaccination program in Kenya has been in any way animated by a desire to sterilize Kenyan women. Such claims have their roots in laboratory testing widely considered to have been flawed in method.

One day after a shooter opened fire on a Tops supermarket in Buffalo, New York, a local news station based in Orlando ran a report from the scene of the massacre. 
The segment that WKMG ran was a package shared from a partner affiliate in Houston, KPRC, featuring a report that KPRC reporter Brandon Walker filmed from Buffalo. 
""Good evening to you from Buffalo, the northeast side of town,"" Walker said in the May 15 report as he stood outside the supermarket, yellow police tape still stretched behind him. 
""Tonight, as FBI investigators continue to process the scene inside Tops Friendly Market, community members reflect on how they feel,"" Walker said. ""There's a lot of sadness, a lot of anger, too, over the racism they say fueled 18-year-old Payton Gendron's actions.""
The problem: Walker was wrongly introduced by WKMG anchor Erik von Ancken as ""Walker Graham,"" and the chyron at the bottom of the screen identified him the same way.
In a statement to PolitiFact, WKMG's assignment desk said the script the station received from KPRC listed Walker's name as ""Walker Graham,"" and the error was carried over onto the air. At the end of his report, Walker signed off by saying, ""I'm Brandon Walker.""
But across social media, the mixup was a sign of something more nefarious, a conspiracy in which Walker was playing the role of a reporter as a ""crisis actor"" on the set of a staged attack.
The ""crisis actor"" claims started with a tweet that put a photo of Walker's report for WKMG, in which he's listed as ""Walker Graham,"" next to a report he did for KPRC under the correct name.
""So he just got two different names depending on the news station?"" said the May 16 tweet. ""One day people, one day you'll realize why people like me question EVERYTHING.""
Screenshots of the tweet quickly spread to Instagram and Facebook, where they were flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

""Let's give a warm welcome to the latest crisis actor in the Buffalo show!"" one Instagram post said. Another post on Facebook said simply, ""#CrisisActor.""
Among the people pushing the false ""crisis actor"" claim was Lauren Witzke, the far-right GOP nominee for a 2020 U.S. Senate seat from Delaware, who has promoted the QAnon conspiracy theory. ""New Buffalo crisis actor just dropped,"" Witzke said in posts on Telegram and Instagram.

PolitiFact previously debunked a Pants on Fire claim that Gendron, who was charged for the shooting, was a ""crisis actor."" There is no evidence that the attack was staged or a ""false flag."" There were multiple witnesses, and the shooter live streamed the assault.
This claim about Walker is also baseless.
""This is a real reporter,"" WKMG's assignment desk said in its statement to PolitiFact. Walker has worked for KPRC since 2015, according to his bio on the KPRC website.
In a reply to the original tweet that set off the ""crisis actor"" conspiracy theory, Walker wrote: ""Seems my colleagues at a sister station don't know my name. Brandon Walker, it is. I work for a station in Houston, KPRC2; however, I've filed reports for our sister stations in other cities.""
Walker and KPRC did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment. 
Another Houston-area journalist tweeted that KPRC and WKMG both are owned by Graham Media Group, a broadcasting company, which might have prompted the ""Walker Graham"" error.

13.DidChelseaClintonTwe,"
In June 2018, multiple disreputable web sites pushed false reports about the alleged discovery of a ""child trafficking bunker"" near Tucson, Arizona.  Many of those same sites also attempted to assert some putative connection between Hillary Clinton and the debunked bunker site, as well as with child sex trafficking in general.
This onslaught of misinformation prompted Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, to issue a tweet likening the phenomenon to the absurd and thoroughly debunked ""Pizzagate conspiracy theory of November 2016 (which held that Hillary Clinton and others were running a child trafficking ring out of a Washington, D.C., pizzeria) and pointing followers to the National Human Trafficking Hotline as a responsible source for dealing with child trafficking reports:

Of course there's a #Pizzagate 2.0. Of course there is. If you have been a victim of trafficking or have suspicions of actual trafficking, please reach out to the National Human Trafficking Hotline: 1-888-373-7888. https://t.co/6IpshzA8Vv
-- Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) June 6, 2018

The disreputable Neon Nettle web site then published an article bizarrely claiming that Chelsea Clinton's tweet constituted an ""admission"" that Pizzagate was ""real"" and that the National Human Trafficking Hotline was actually ""run"" by her mother:

Daughter of the former secretary of state Hillary Clinton has seemingly admitted that 'Pizzagate' -- the conspiracy theory born out of the Wikileaks emails allegedly exposing politicians running pedophile rings - is real on her Twitter. 
In a strange rant, Chelsea Clinton Tweeted ""of course there's a #Pizzagate 2.0. Of course, there is,"" in a sarcastic reference to the recent child trafficking bust in Arizona. 
Not long after the Tweet was sent out, Twitter users discovered that National Human Trafficking Hotline that Chelsea mentioned in her Tweet is actually the organization run by her mother Hillary, one of the many high profile people accused of being involved in the child sex ring in Washington D.C.

All of this was false: Chelsea Clinton's tweet was neither ""strange"" nor a ""rant,"" nor did she literally tweet that 'Pizzagate is real' (or anything else that could rationally be construed as an admission of such) -- Ms. Clinton was clearly referencing and expressing dismay at her mother's name being dragged into yet another preposterous child trafficking rumor.  Moreover, Hillary Clinton does not ""run"" the human trafficking hotline her daughter tweeted about, as its parent organization's chief communications officer, Caren Benjamin, told us:

The National Human Trafficking Hotline is operated by Polaris, a nonpartisan, non-profit, non-governmental organization that is a leader in the global fight to eradicate modern slavery and restore freedom to survivors of human trafficking. We are not a government, law enforcement, or immigration [entity].  Funding is provided by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other private donors and supporters.

22.Wasa400FootIceShipDi,"
On Aug. 7, 2020, YouTube user MrMBB333 published a video that appeared to show a ship in ice that measured over 400 feet (122 meters) in length. The images were captured from Google Earth. The moment with the ""ice ship"" begin at the 5:05 mark:





This was sent in by D. Whitaker, this area here. And he noticed this iceberg here, if we go to the 3D format, you look down on it. It looks like the outline of a ship, and this one here measures over 400 feet long. 428 feet (130 meters) to be exact. Whatever that is that looks like a ship. The ice ship, whatever you want to call it, that's what it looks like. A 400-foot yacht just sitting there off the coast of Antarctica, right in this area here just beneath New Zealand and Antarctica, right in that area there about a hundred miles offshore.
This discovery was undoctored. The ""ice ship"" can be viewed on Google Maps or Google Earth using its satellite view by clicking this link, or by entering these coordinates into Google Maps: 66deg54'18''S 163deg13'37''E.
Shadows around the shape measured quite long, meaning that it was well above the surface of the rest of the ice. If it was a ship, it was listing on its side. In Google Earth, one shadow stretched 90 feet (27 meters) long: 







While the video was undoctored, and it certainly looked like the outline of a large ship, we are unable to definitively confirm that it is, indeed, a ship. The ""ice ship"" story from the video was mostly picked up by tabloids.
The Sun, Mirror Online, and others all detailed conspiracy theories from viewers who commented under the YouTube video. Commenters said that it might have something to do with World War II, Adolf Hitler, aliens, or Nazis. At least one person said it could be a ship that's being built underground for the rich and powerful, for when the Canary Islands gets hit with a massive natural disaster that's purportedly going to take out the east coast of the United States. All of these theories are baseless and unconfirmed.
Even so, ships have gone down in Antarctica in the 21st century. For example, the Canadian cruise ship named MS Explorer sank in 2007. However, its last known location was more than 3,000 miles (8,000 kilometers) from the ""ice ship."" The purportedly ""rat-infested"" Lyubov Orlova, a ship that in 2013 was abandoned and adrift in the middle of the ocean, was only 295 feet (90 meters) long, not nearly as long as the ""ice ship"" shape. The ""cannibal rats"" aspect of the ship's story didn't hold much water.
Photographer Robin Smith captured this image of the Lyubov Orlova around 2012, before it likely sank in early 2013:
Robin Smith published this photograph on Getty Images with a date of Feb. 23, 2012.
Another famous ship, although not tied to Antarctica, was the century-old SS Cotopaxi. It was finally positively identified in early 2020 after being discovered years earlier. The SS Cotopaxi is not the ""ice ship"" seen on Google Maps.
""Ice ship"" or not, the only way to definitively confirm what lies at these Antarctic coordinates is for an expedition to set sail. If that ever happens, we'll be here awaiting the big news.

176.TheMuellerreportWhat,"
Special Counsel Robert Mueller's highly anticipated report presents a sweeping narrative of Russia's 2016 election interference and clears the Trump campaign of criminally conspiring with the Kremlin. It also details the president's efforts to curtail the nearly two-year probe, though Mueller declined to say whether or not Trump's conduct amounted to illegal obstruction.
The report reaffirms the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia favored Trump over Hillary Clinton, and notes that the Trump campaign believed it would benefit  on Election Day from Moscow's interference.
But Mueller found the Kremlin's acts on Trump's behalf and numerous contacts between the campaign and Russia didn't rise to the level of criminal conspiracy or coordination. These contacts comprise the report's first volume, which is heavily redacted in some sections, mostly owing to its use of material that relates to cases still being pursued by other prosecutors.
In the report's second volume, Mueller's team documented 10 instances of Trump trying to impede the investigation or directing his staff to do so (including firing Mueller). Ultimately, Mueller chose not to say whether Trump did or did not obstruct justice.  
Mueller: There were numerous contacts, but no criminal conspiracy between Trump campaign and Russia
Mueller found the Trump campaign did not engage in a criminal conspiracy or illegal coordination with Russia.
The special counsel's decision not to charge Trump with conspiracy came despite what Mueller described as a series of ""salient moments"" over the 2016 election season and presidential transition -- which will be familiar to those who have followed the investigation.
Mueller confirmed that the triggering event for the FBI opening a counterintelligence investigation into links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government came as a result of an April 2016 meeting between campaign adviser George Papadopoulos and a source who said Russian government officials could offer ""dirt"" on Clinton in the form of ""thousands of emails.""
The report also recounts the June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower that Donald Trump Jr. arranged based on a promise that a ""Russian government attorney"" would supply the campaign with incriminating evidence against Clinton as part of the Kremlin's support for his father's candidacy.
Mueller also notes that Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort shared internal polling data with his long-time business associate Konstantin Kilimnik, who the FBI has linked to Russian intelligence, and discussed with Kilimnik the campaign's strategy for winning over Democratic voters in the Midwest.
At least some of these contacts occurred while Trump pursued Trump Tower Moscow deal and publicly espoused pro-Russian policies.
Nonetheless, Mueller found the series of links and alignment of interests did not amount to a criminal conspiracy or illegal coordination.
""Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts,"" Mueller's report states, ""the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.""
Mueller did not reach a conclusion about whether Trump obstructed
Mueller declined to say if Trump had obstructed justice. Attorney General Barr and the deputy attorney general concluded Trump had not.
The special counsel explained that the unusual circumstances surrounding the probe made it difficult to issue a traditional binary judgment about whether to indict. But Mueller's reluctance to reach a prosecutorial conclusion should not be interpreted as an exoneration of the president on the issue of obstruction, he said.
""The evidence we obtained about the president's actions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred,"" Mueller said. ""Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.""
After Mueller declined to reach a conclusion about obstruction, Barr stepped in.
In a move that left legal experts divided, Barr reasoned that Mueller's silence ""leaves it to the attorney general to determine"" if Trump obstructed justice. Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded the president had not done so.
Trump's efforts to curtail the investigation
Though Trump will not be charged with obstruction of justice during his presidency, Mueller's report paints a searing portrait of Trump's attempts to hamper investigators.   
Mueller lists some 10 ""key issues and events"" that his team examined as part of its obstruction investigation. Some of the events had been previously reported in the press, while other conduct has been made public for the first time through Mueller's report.
The special counsel's team probed events that James Comey has testified about before Congress, including Trump's request to then-FBI Director Comey that he drop the investigation into Trump's embattled former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who has since pled guilty to lying to the FBI.
Mueller also investigated other highly publicized events, like Trump's firing of Comey, and the president's involvement in crafting a misleading statement on his son's behalf regarding the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting.
But the report also provides a window into Trump's distress over the news that a special counsel had been appointed in the wake of Comey's firing.
""Oh my God. This is terrible,"" the report quotes Trump as saying. ""This is the end of my presidency. I'm f-----.""
Trump grew more alarmed following media reports that the special counsel's office would look into whether Trump obstructed justice, according to the report.
It describes a frantic Trump calling then-White House counsel Don McGahn at home and ordering him to say Mueller should be removed due to conflicts of interest. McGahn refused.
""The president's efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful,"" the Mueller report notes, ""but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the president declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.""

69.CoronavirusMisinform,"



5.9KChina first reported an unusual cluster of pneumonia cases in the city of Wuhan on Dec. 31, and, within a month, the internet was infected with misinformation about the responsible virus, now called the 2019 novel coronavirus.
Fact-checking organizations, including FactCheck.org, from 30 countries collaborated through the International Fact-Checking Network at the Poynter Institute to debunk the false claims as they developed. So far, those organizations have published more than 80 fact-checking articles.
On Jan. 30, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency. As of the same date, there had been 170 deaths from the virus, all of them in China. Globally, there had been 7,818 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus.
Despite those facts, false claims were circulating widely on social media that as many as 10,000 people had died from the virus. We debunked those claims as well as budding conspiracy theories that misrepresented an unrelated patent and blamed the virus on a ""Chinese spy team.""
Here's a round-up of what we've debunked with links to our stories:

Multiple social media posts falsely claimed that the virus has been patented and a vaccine is already available. That's not true; the patents the posts refer to pertain to different viruses. See ""Social Media Posts Spread Bogus Coronavirus Conspiracy Theory"" for more.


A post on Facebook falsely claimed comedian Sam Hyde was responsible for the spread of the new coronavirus. Researchers are still working to determine the source of this latest coronavirus, though evidence suggests it was first transmitted to humans from an animal. See ""Comedian Sam Hyde Not 'Behind' Spread of Coronavirus"" for more.


Websites and social media posts circulated the erroneous claim that there are ""thousands"" or ""10,000"" dead as a result of the Wuhan coronavirus. When we published this story on Jan. 27, the estimated death toll was 81. As of Jan. 30, it had risen to 170 -- all of them in China. See ""Misinformation on Coronavirus Death Toll"" for more.


Social media posts falsely claimed that a ""Chinese spy team"" working in a Canadian government lab sent ""pathogens to the Wuhan facility"" prior to the coronavirus outbreak in China. Two Canadian agencies told us those claims are wrong. See ""Coronavirus Wasn't Sent by 'Spy' From Canada"" for more.


A conspiracy theory website distorted the facts about an emergency preparedness exercise to suggest that the ""GATES FOUNDATION & OTHERS PREDICTED UP TO 65 MILLION DEATHS"" from the coronavirus now spreading. The event dealt with a hypothetical scenario involving a fictional virus. See ""New Coronavirus Wasn't 'Predicted' In Simulation"" for more.


Numerous social media posts falsely suggest that because Clorox and Lysol products list ""Human Coronavirus"" on their bottles, the new coronavirus driving the outbreak in China was already known. It wasn't. There are many human coronaviruses, and these products were tested against a strain that causes the common cold. See ""No, Clorox and Lysol Didn't Already 'Know' About New Coronavirus.""


We also posted a comprehensive Q&A on the novel coronavirus. See ""Q&A on the Wuhan Coronavirus"" for more.

302.SayJoeBidenisapedophile,"
It's no secret that political candidates running for office face a barrage of personal attacks on the campaign trail -- the 2020 presidential election is no different. 
One of the most egregious examples we have come across is illustrated by a flood of social media posts that claim Joe Biden, the former vice president and presumptive Democratic nominee for president, is a ""pedophile.""
Allegations of child sex molestation are a prominent part of the QAnon conspiracy theory that suggests a ""deep state"" is working against President Trump's success.
The posts were flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
We found no credible evidence that supports this claim. Pedophilia is characterized by an obsession of seeing children as sex objects, according to Nolo's Plain English Law Dictionary: ""A person who acts upon this obsession, by molesting a child, taking explicit photographs, and performing other acts specified by law, is guilty of a crime.""
In Biden's more than 40 years of public life -- including two prior runs for the Democratic presidential nomination and eight years as vice president -- there have been no formal accusations, complaints, arrests or investigations that implicate him in any sort of sex crimes involving kids.
Biden has been accused by some adult women of unwanted touching in public -- and former Senate staffer Tara Reade accused him of sexual assault -- but there have never been any credible accusations of Biden engaging in inappropriate conduct with children. 
Our searches of Google and the Nexis database, dating back to Biden's Senate days, turned up no arrests, news reports, or authoritative testimonies of inappropriate acts by Biden involving children.
When we reached out to discuss the accusations, Biden's campaign pointed us to a May 2020 statement that was issued in response to an Instagram post by Donald Trump Jr. in which the president's son shared an image of Biden saying, ""See you later, alligator"" alongside a photo of an alligator saying, ""In a while, pedophile,"" to his 3 million followers.
Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Biden, told the New York Times, ""No repulsive, manipulative tactic will change the subject from how almost 90,000 Americans have paid for Donald Trump's coronavirus negligence with their lives and how the booming economy he inherited from the Obama-Biden Administration is now suffering from depression-level job losses."" The COVID-19 death count in the U.S., as of this writing, is over 164,000.
Trump Jr. later claimed he was ""just joking"" in a Twitter post, yet also repeated the insinuation by saying Biden should stop his ""unwanted touching"" and posted a collage of photographs of Biden with children at White House events.
Biden briefly addressed Trump Jr.'s actions shortly after, saying that what the president's son was ""trying to do is get something going on the internet"" by repeating the claim often enough that people believe it.  
""It's sick,"" Biden said during a Yahoo News virtual town hall. ""But he is his father's son.""

Viral image


stated on June 12, 2022 in social media posts








Image shows Paul Pelosi, bruised, in a booking mugshot.












By Grace Abels * June 14, 2022







President Donald Trump has also been accused of sexual misconduct by several women. Dated photos of Trump with young girls, some of them doctored, have also spread on social media along with unproven allegations that he, too, is a pedophile.
Examining the images
On social media, the accusation is often accompanied by images, memes, GIFs and videos of Biden appearing to touch children inappropriately. The photos that are real often lack context. Others are not of him or have been deceptively edited to suggest something improper.
We found that these images are overwhelmingly captured at public events when he is posing for pictures or greeting people and many depict Biden showing affection toward his family.
For example, one photo, of Biden leaning down by a boy with his hand cupped on the child's face, shows him comforting his grandson at the funeral of Beau Biden, Biden's son who died of brain cancer. Another image from the funeral routinely used in posts shows Biden kissing the top of his granddaughter's head as she stands holding her mother's hand. Another shows Biden leaning in to kiss his grandson during his 2013 swearing-in ceremony as vice president.
RELATED: No, this photo doesn't show Joe Biden engaging in disturbing behavior with a boy
Some of the photos used in the posts were taken at various White House events over the years, and in multiple cases the parents have spoken out against claims that Biden behaved inappropriately around their children.
One often-used photo shows Biden touching a young girl's arm as he leans in to whisper something as she looks slightly uncomfortable.
The image shows Maggie Coons, the daughter of Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, during her father's swearing-in ceremony in January 2015. 
After the clip went viral, Sen. Coons, a Democrat, told Fox News host Chris Wallace that Biden was simply offering her reassurance and that his daughter didn't think he was creepy. Coons said that Biden, who held Coons' Senate seat before resigning to serve as vice president, has known his children their whole lives.
""I could hear him,"" Coons said in the interview. ""He was leaning forward and whispering some encouragement to her about how, when he was sworn in, his own daughter Ashley was 13 and she felt awkward and uncomfortable.""
Carly Melin, former member of the Minnesota House of Representatives, spoke out on Twitter when a 2014 photo she took with Biden and former U.S. Rep. Rick Nolan, D-Minn., became the subject of a Twitter thread by conservative columnist Richard Armande Mills. In the image, Melin and Biden are both holding Melin's son. Mills, a conservative columnist for Turning Point USA, wrote in the tweet that Biden is ""an open sexual predator.""
""Sir, I don't know you,"" Melin responded. ""You have tweeted out multiple photos of my infant son in a disturbing, misconstrued attempt to advance your political viewpoint. Delete all tweets that include my son. I've reported your behavior to Twitter. Thank you.""
Our ruling
Social media users claim that Biden is a pedophile. There is zero evidence -- no accusations, testimonies, arrests or investigations -- that gives this claim any credibility.
Photos that supposedly support the claim are taken out of context or have been directly contradicted by the families involved.
We rate this Pants on Fire.

Fact Check
A former California judge named Keith M. Alber truly wrote a letter that appeared in a newspaper under the title ""Opinion From a Former Judge"" and spread across Facebook since at least December 2021. We confirmed the letter's authenticity by speaking with Alber over the phone. 






One of the more popular postings of the article came from a Facebook account named Chad Jones. As of mid-May 2022, that post had been shared more than 11,000 times:



The letter read as follows:
Opinion From a Former JudgeI am a student of law whose age is 85. My first year of college was 68 years ago. One class I took was political science. A half-page of my textbook essentially outlined a few steps to overturn a democracy.1) Divide the nation philosophically.2) Foment racial strife.3) Cause distrust of police authority.4) Swarm the nation's borders indiscriminately and unconstitutionally.5) Engender the military strength to weaken it.6) Overburden citizens with more unfair taxation.7) Encourage civil rioting and discourage accountability for all crime.8) Control all balloting.9) Control all media.What was printed in 1954 as a possible diabolic nightmare has become an emerging reality. I hope that Americans will unite enough to pen a good finish - Go dwelling.Keith M. AlberCalifornia
The Origins of the Newspaper Article
Initially, when looking for the origins of Alber's ""Opinion From a Former Judge,"" we came up empty. As far as we could tell, a syndicated columnist named Ronald Hart once reprinted the letter in December 2021, but the trail seemed to end there.
However, after some additional research, we made contact with Alber over the phone.
Alber said he wrote the letter in October 2021 and sent it to The Epoch Times newspaper. (The letter in the photo that circulated on social media was believed to have come from that print publication.) The Epoch Times has a history of promoting far-right political rhetoric and conspiracy theories. 






He told us he couldn't remember the name of the college textbook he referenced, though he recalled having the book in 1954 when he attended ""Napa College,"" or what is now called Napa Valley College.
Interviewing Alber
We asked Alber if he had anything to add regarding his letter, ""Opinion From a Former Judge."" He shared the following:
At the time I read [the steps to overturn a democracy] back in 1954, I thought, 'That could never happen. That would be a nightmare.' And it would be disastrous for this country if that ever did happen. Years later, when it was happening, the attempt to achieve those goals was a reality. I became very alarmed. I have pretty much dedicated my life to the justice system and laws. I was a bench officer for 25 years in the Superior Court, and I've been interviewed by many news people. I don't know, I just feel [the current state of the country is] a very sad comment on the public being so dumb.
On the subject of politics, Alber told us, ""I don't have any comment about politics. It's not my specialty. And, so I don't say anything about it.""
""I'm like Voltaire,"" he added. ""I may not agree with what you say, but I will defend your right to say it.""
In sum, yes, Alber wrote the virally shared article that was titled, ""Opinion from a Former Judge,"" and listed nine steps on how to overturn a democracy. This story will be updated if we receive any additional information about the textbook to which he referred in his letter.

18.GingrichSpreadsConsp,"



4.8KNewt Gingrich claimed that a Democratic National Committee staffer ""apparently was assassinated"" after ""having given WikiLeaks something like ... 53,000 [DNC] emails and 17,000 attachments."" But there's no evidence for his claim.
The former Republican House speaker is spreading a conspiracy theory about the killing of Seth Rich, who was shot to death in Washington, D.C., in the early morning hours of July 10, 2016, in what local police have described as a likely botched robbery.
The unsubstantiated claim about Rich's murder got legs recently after Fox 5 in Washington, D.C., reported -- and a day later largely retracted -- that the FBI completed a forensic report on Rich's computer and found that he had transferred 44,053 DNC emails and 17,761 attachments to WikiLeaks.
Fox 5 aired those details on the morning of May 16, based on the work of a private investigator, Rod Wheeler, who was hired by a third party with the consent of Rich's family. But later that evening, Wheeler told Fox News' Sean Hannity that he had no evidence that Rich was in contact with WikiLeaks.
""Maybe it is related to the DNC. We don't know that. We don't know that for sure,"" Wheeler told Hannity. ""It could have been a botched robbery.""
CNN also reported on May 16 that Wheeler had no firsthand knowledge that Rich had been in contact with WikiLeaks. Wheeler told CNN that he got that information from another reporter at Fox News.
Fox 5 issued an ""update"" the next day that quoted Wheeler as saying there was a ""miscommunication"" between him and the local TV news station on whether he had anonymous FBI sources who confirmed that Rich had contacted WikiLeaks before his death.
Fox 5, May 17: In an interview Monday, Wheeler told FOX 5 DC he had sources at the FBI confirming there was evidence of communication between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks. This is the verbatim of that exchange:
FOX 5 DC: ""You have sources at the FBI saying that there is information...""
WHEELER: ""For sure...""
FOX 5 DC: ""...that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?""
WHEELER: ""Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.""
In the past 48 hours, Rod Wheeler has told other media outlets he did not get his information from FBI sources, contradicting what he told us on Monday.
Since Rod Wheeler backtracked Tuesday, FOX 5 DC attempted incessantly to communicate with him, but he didn't return calls or emails.
On Wednesday, just before our newscast, Wheeler responded to our requests via a telephone conversation, where he now backtracks his position and Wheeler characterizes his on-the-record and on-camera statements as ""miscommunication.""
Fox 5 also published a statement from the Rich family that read, in part: ""As we've seen through the past year of unsubstantiated claims, we see no facts, we have seen no evidence, we have been approached with no emails and only learned about this when contacted by the press. Even if tomorrow, an email was found, it is not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions as emails can be altered and we've seen that those interested in pushing conspiracies will stop at nothing to do so.""
Even though Wheeler and Fox 5 had already backed down from the original story, Gingrich repeated the disputed facts several days later on May 21 on ""Fox and Friends.""
Gingrich has served as an informal adviser to Trump, and his wife, Callista, has been nominated by Trump to be the U.S. ambassador to the Vatican. Gingrich made his remarks about Rich's murder while discussing the Department of Justice's appointment of former FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III as special counsel to investigate any possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government's efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election.
The Georgia Republican discounted U.S. intelligence reports that say hackers working for the Russian government accessed the Democratic Party computers and gave DNC emails to WikiLeaks in an effort to help Trump win the election. Gingrich said that ""it turns out, it wasn't the Russians,"" but rather the DNC staffer who leaked the documents -- echoing a tweet two days earlier by the Russian embassy in London.
Gingrich, May 21: At the same time, we have this very strange story now of this young man who worked for the Democratic National Committee, who apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning, having given WikiLeaks something like 23,000 -- I'm sorry, 53,000 emails and 17,000 attachments. Nobody is investigating that. And what does that tell you about what was going on? Because it turns out, it wasn't the Russians. It was this young guy who, I suspect, was disgusted by the corruption of the Democratic National Committee. He's been killed, and apparently nothing serious has been done to investigate his murder. So I'd like to see how Mueller is going to define what his assignment is, and if it is only narrowly Trump the country will not learn what it needs to learn about foreign involvement in American politics.
Rich's murder remains unsolved, and has been the subject of conspiracy theories for many months -- fueled in part by WikiLeaks offering a reward of $20,000 to solve the case.
In a Jan. 6 report, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said: ""Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election."" Among other things, the report said, Russian intelligence services gained access to Democratic National Committee computers, from July 2015 to June 2016, and released hacked material to WikiLeaks and other websites. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has denied Russia was the source of the DNC emails.
Beginning July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks released 44,053 DNC emails and 17,761 attachments -- the same number of emails and attachments that Fox 5 had claimed in its May 16 report that Rich transferred to WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a friend and mentor of Assange. MacFadyen died in October.
But, as we have already noted, the Fox 5 story quickly unraveled. The Washington Metropolitan Police Department issued a statement the same day saying that ""the assertions put forward by Mr. Wheeler are unfounded.""
Brad Bauman, a Democratic communications consultant who serves as a spokesman for the Rich family, told us that the FBI is not investigating Rich's murder -- further undermining the premise of the Fox 5 report. ""The FBI is not now and has never been a party to this investigation,"" he said.
Bauman also said that the Washington Metropolitan Police Department did review the contents of Rich's personal laptop, but found ""no apparent communications with anyone who was associated with WikiLeaks."" The laptop has since been returned to the family, he said.
The Washington Metropolitan Police Department initially described the incident as a botched robbery based on the evidence at the time, according to a first-day story of the murder in the Washington Post.
Washington Post, July 11: Acting D.C. Police Capt. Anthony Haythe, head of the homicide unit, said detectives are examining several recent robberies in the area to determine whether any can be linked. There were two robberies in the city in the hour preceding the shooting, both more than one mile away. Three people were robbed at gunpoint and another person was carjacked within four days in June on Flagler Place, near where Rich was shot. Police report 20 armed holdups in Bloomingdale so far this year, compared with eight at this time in 2015.
Bauman said the status of the investigation has not changed. ""There never has been any indication that Seth Rich's murder had anything to do with his job"" at the DNC, said Bauman, who told us he is representing the Rich family pro bono after Rich's parents reached out to two of Rich's friends for help in dealing with media requests.
We don't know who killed Seth Rich or why. We do know, however, that Gingrich's speculation about the case is unfounded. There is no evidence to support the claim that Rich leaked DNC emails to WikiLeaks or that he was murdered for it. And the news report that claimed to have ""tangible evidence"" to prove it has been walked back by the very people who promoted it and reported it.
Update, May 23: Fox News on May 23 removed from its website an article about the Fox 5 report on Seth Rich's murder and a video of an interview that Fox News' Sean Hannity did with Rod Wheeler. We linked to the Hannity interview in this story and have replaced the expired link with an archived link.
In a statement, Fox News said, ""On May 16, a story was posted on the Fox News website on the investigation into the 2016 murder of DNC Staffer Seth Rich. The article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting. Upon appropriate review, the article was found not to meet those standards and has since been removed."" 
Also, the Washington Metropolitan Police Department responded to some of our questions after we posted this article. The police department confirmed that the FBI is not involved in the Rich murder investigation, but declined to say if any law enforcement agency has examined the contents of Rich's computer and emails. 
The police also provided us with a statement that read: ""At this point in the investigation, it is believed that Seth Rich was the victim of an attempted robbery. The assertions put forward by Mr. Wheeler are unfounded. The Metropolitan Police Department's (MPD) Homicide Branch is actively investigating Mr. Rich's murder and we continue to work with the family to bring closure to this case as we do with all homicide investigations. If there are any individuals who feel they have information, we urge them to call us at 202-727-9099 or text us at 50411. The department is offering a reward of up to $25,000 for information on this case that leads to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible.""

155.FionaHillandconspira,"
Fiona Hill used her testimony in the House impeachment hearings to heap contempt on conspiracy theories and those who spread them, specifically the incorrect notion that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 U.S. election.
Hill served as the National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia, recently leaving the post on July 19. 
Hill took aim not only at supporters of President Donald Trump, but also directly at Republican members of the committee where she was testifying.
""Based on questions and statements I have heard, some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country -- and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did,"" Hill said in her opening statement. ""This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.""
Hill was echoing a focus of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. When Mueller spoke at the Justice Department following the completion of his report, he said, ""I will close by reiterating the central allegation of our indictments -- that there were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election. That allegation deserves the attention of every American.""
Here, we'll recap what Hill said about ""false narratives"" and then provide summaries of the persistent conspiracy theories that have been debunked.
Who is Fiona Hill?
In her opening statement, Hill recalled her experience growing up as the child of a coal miner and a midwife in northern England. Her parents were never able to immigrate to America, but Hill used education to see the wider world, studying in Russia and at Harvard.
She joined the National Intelligence Council, an office that produces reports for the intelligence community, in 2006, focusing on Russia and Eurasia. She joined the Brookings Institution, a centrist to left-of-center think tank, in 2009. While there, she co-authored the book ""Mr. Putin: Operative in the Kremlin"" in 2013.
During the Trump administration, Hill served as a top National Security Council expert on Russia and Europe, supervising previous impeachment witness Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman. She left her post in the summer of 2019 and was succeeded in that post by another impeachment witness, Tim Morrison, before he resigned the NSC post in October.
Hill left her position ""to spend more time with her husband and 12-year-old daughter and her mother, who is ill,"" the New York Times reported.
What did Hill tell the committee about conspiracy theories?
Hill was brought aboard at the National Security Council early in the Trump administration, based on her expertise on Russia. She leaned on that expertise in her opening statement.

Former National Security Council official Fiona Hill testifies before the House Intelligence Committee on Nov. 21, 2019.
She said that, ""based on questions and statements I have heard, some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country--and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did. This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.
""The unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in 2016. This is the public conclusion of our intelligence agencies, confirmed in bipartisan Congressional reports. It is beyond dispute, even if some of the underlying details must remain classified.
""The impact of the successful 2016 Russian campaign remains evident today. Our nation is being torn apart. Truth is questioned. Our highly professional and expert career foreign service is being undermined. U.S. support for Ukraine -- which continues to face armed Russian aggression -- has been politicized. The Russian government's goal is to weaken our country -- to diminish America's global role and to neutralize a perceived U.S. threat to Russian interests. President Putin and the Russian security services aim to counter U.S. foreign policy objectives in Europe, including in Ukraine, where Moscow wishes to reassert political and economic dominance.
""I say this not as an alarmist, but as a realist. I do not think long-term conflict with Russia is either desirable or inevitable. I continue to believe that we need to seek ways of stabilizing our relationship with Moscow even as we counter their efforts to harm us. Right now, Russia's security services and their proxies have geared up to repeat their interference in the 2020 election. We are running out of time to stop them. In the course of this investigation, I would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests.
""As Republicans and Democrats have agreed for decades, Ukraine is a valued partner of the United States, and it plays an important role in our national security. And as I told this Committee last month, I refuse to be part of an effort to legitimize an alternate narrative that the Ukrainian government is a U.S. adversary, and that Ukraine -- not Russia -- attacked us in 2016.
""These fictions are harmful even if they are deployed for  purely domestic political purposes. President Putin and the Russian security services operate like a super PAC. They deploy millions of dollars to weaponize our own political opposition research and false narratives. When we are consumed by partisan rancor, we cannot combat these external forces as they seek to divide us against each other, degrade our institutions, and destroy the faith of the American people in our democracy.
""I respect the work that this Congress does in carrying out its constitutional responsibilities, including in this inquiry, and I am here to help you to the best of my ability. If the President, or anyone else, impedes or subverts the national security of the United States in order to further domestic political or personal interests, that is more than worthy of your attention. But we must not let domestic politics stop us from defending ourselves against the foreign powers who truly wish us harm.""
The ""Crowdstrike"" theory
So, what are some of the ""false narratives"" that have been swirling around Ukraine in recent months? One conspiracy theory often cited by Trump's strongest allies is one that suggests that 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's missing emails somehow wound up in Ukraine.
The conspiracy theory claims the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike hid a server of Clinton's emails from the intelligence community's investigation -- and that Ukraine somehow controlled Crowdstrike.
We found no evidence that Crowdstrike ever worked on issues around Clinton's private email server. Crowdstrike was involved in investigating the hack of the Democratic National Committee, which is altogether different from the Clinton emails.
And while Trump in 2017 told the Associated Press that a ""very rich Ukrainian"" owned the company, the firm is actually owned by Crowdstrike Holdings, Inc., which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif. The company was co-founded by CEO George Kurtz, CTO Dmitri Alperovitch and Gregg Marston (now retired) in 2011. Conspiracists claim Alperovitch is Ukrainian, when in reality he's an American citizen who was born in Russia.
RELATED FACT-CHECK: ""Trump mentioned the 'Crowdstrike' conspiracy during his call with Ukraine. Here's what that means""
The theory that Ukraine, not Russia, meddled in the 2016 election
These conspiracies have roots in some fringe beliefs that Ukraine coordinated the DNC hack to frame the Russians. That conspiracy grew on internet sites like Reddit and 4chan, and has slowly trickled into the mainstream over the past few years. It's been amplified by conservative and Russian media outlets, social media and even the criminal trial of Roger Stone, a former Trump adviser.
But the theory is bunk. The U.S. intelligence community has reaffirmed the role that Russia played in meddling in the 2016 election, as outlined in former special prosecutor Robert Mueller's report -- particularly when it came to the DNC hack.
The theory that Ukrainians worked with the Obama White House to spread false information
In October 2019, Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said on ABC's ""This Week"" that ""there is a load of evidence that the Ukrainians created false information, that they were asked by the Obama White House to do it in January of 2016.""
This is unproven. We found no evidence showing that the Obama administration asked the Ukrainians to produce false information in 2016.
Biden met with former Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko on Jan. 20, 2016, to discuss the importance of moving forward with Ukraine's anti-corruption agenda, according to a two-sentence summary of the meeting.
There was another meeting that month in Washington between Ukrainian investigators and American officials to discuss coordinating their anti-corruption efforts, according to an April 2019 opinion article in The Hill by John Solomon. (The newspaper has since announced a review of his work.) But there's no evidence that the Americans asked for false information during that meeting.
RELATED FACT-CHECK: ""The inaccurate or unproven things Rudy Giuliani said about Ukraine on 'This Week""
The theory that Joe Biden committed corrupt actions to protect his son
Hunter Biden held a directorship with a natural gas company called Burisma Holdings beginning in the spring of 2014. Biden's Burisma directorship attracted attention because Burisma was owned by Mykola Zlochevsky, a minister under Russia-friendly President Viktor F. Yanukovych, who subsequently went into exile after a popular revolution. After Yanukovych was ousted, Zlochevsky faced a variety of corruption-related investigations involving his business.
In 2015, Ukraine's newly appointed prosecutor general Viktor Shokin inherited some of the investigations into Zlochevsky and his company. (Zlochevsky and the company have denied the allegations.)
The theory argued by Trump allies is that then-Vice President Joe Biden was protecting his son by seeking the firing of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin.
There's no question that Joe Biden did seek Shokin's ouster. During an event sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations on Jan. 23, 2018, Biden proudly recounted a threat he made to withhold U.S. aid unless Shokin was sacked. Biden said the incumbent prosecutor was failing to aggressively pursue allegations of corruption in Ukraine.
But Biden was hardly alone in calling for Shokin's ouster. That was the wider U.S. government position, and Western leaders and institutions were largely united in seeking Shokin's removal, arguing that he was not pursuing corruption cases aggressively.
For instance, in early 2016, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde said that ""it's hard to see how the I.M.F.-supported program can continue"" unless corruption prosecutions accelerate. Shokin's ouster came in March 2016, when he was stripped of his position by a wide margin in the legislature.
Meanwhile, it's far from clear that the ouster of Shokin would have made any difference in Hunter Biden's fate. Vitaliy Kasko, who had been Shokin's deputy overseeing international cooperation, produced documents to Bloomberg that under Shokin, the investigation into Burisma had been dormant. Kasko resigned in February 2016 citing corruption in the office.
Anders Aslund, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington, agreed that criticism of Shokin was widespread
Shokin ""failed to prosecute anybody of significance, protecting both the Yanukovych circle and the Poroshenko group,"" Aslund told PolitiFact in May.

7.HowTrumpisCarvingHis,"

Among the many sub-plots and narrative threads of this year's mid-term primaries, one of the most intriguing is the involvement of former President Donald Trump. In principle, at least, he has been shifted to the sidelines of the American political arena -- banned from the most popular social media platforms, not actively running for office, and not dominating cable news as he had for the previous five years.
And yet, he looms large over the Republican party's primaries, with candidates scrambling to secure a photo-op, some face time at Mar-a-Lago, or best of all, an endorsement and a rally.  
At times, Trump has wielded those endorsements like daggers, ""endorsing against"" Republicans who dared to cross him in 2020 or 2021. But he has also appeared strategic at times, withholding or delaying his endorsement, or leveraging it to ease candidates out of play. 
Snopes has closely examined the former president's Republican primary endorsements and pronouncements from recent months, and identified some intriguing trends. Here's what we found.
Election 2020: Revenge
(SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) 






For the most part, Trump has been either explicit in describing, or transparent in demonstrating, his motivations for attacking certain Republicans, and endorsing their opponents: revenge against those who crossed him on the two subjects that appear to have occupied his thoughts for 18 months. Those are his failed re-election bid in 2020, and Republican support for his impeachment after some of his followers stormed the U.S. Capitol to prevent the certification of President Joe Biden's victory.
In particular, U.S. Reps. Liz Cheney, of Wyoming, and Adam Kinzinger, of Illinois, have been the subject of relentless ridicule and ad hominen attacks from Trump, ever since they crossed the aisle to vote in favor of his second impeachment, in January 2021, on a charge of incitement of insurrection.
The former president endorsed Cheney's primary opponent, Harriet Hageman, at the earliest possible opportunity -- the day she announced she was running, in September 2021. In ""endorsing against"" Cheney, as it's known, Trump has labeled her a ""warmonger and disloyal Republican"" and a ""warmongering fool."" Cheney appears to be facing an uphill battle to keep her seat. In February 2022, a straw poll of Wyoming GOP activists suggested Hageman held a resounding lead, less than six months out from the August primary. 
In October, when Kinzinger announced he would not run again, Trump appeared to revel in the possibility that his revenge attacks had weakened Kinzinger's appetite for a re-election bid, even if redistricting appeared to play a telling role. 
The Republican primary in the Georgia gubernatorial election is another fascinating race. Incumbent Brian Kemp, running for reelection, became one of Trump's favorite GOP targets after he formally certified the state's election results in November 2020, giving Biden 16 additional electoral college votes and dealing a major blow to Trump's hopes of a path to victory in an election he had clearly already lost. 
In 2022, Trump is offering a full-throated endorsement of Kemp's Republican primary challenger -- David Perdue, who lost his U.S. Senate seat to Democrat Jon Ossoff in January 2021. ""Brian Kemp has failed Georgia,"" Trump wrote in December, adding that the governor had ""allowed massive election fraud to take place."" 
Over in the Pacific Northwest, in Washington's 4th Congressional District, four-term incumbent Republican Dan Newhouse faces a MAGA backlash of his own. In the bitter and uncertain weeks that followed Biden's victory over Trump, Newhouse joined with dozens of Republican House members in filing an amicus curiae brief before the U.S. Supreme Court in Texas vs. Pennsylvania -- an unsuccessful bid to prevent key swing states including Pennsylvania and Michigan from certifying Biden's win.
However, despite joining in that courtroom effort to keep Trump in office and fight off Biden's inevitable victory, Newhouse later committed the cardinal sin of voting for Trump's impeachment. Seemingly horrified by the events of Jan. 6, Newhouse wrote:

This is also a vote to condone President Trump's inaction. He did not strongly condemn the attack nor did he call in reinforcements when our officers were overwhelmed. Our country needed a leader, and President Trump failed to fulfill his oath of office.
 






That was enough to set several GOP primary challengers against Newhouse, and in February 2022, Trump finalized his choice, endorsing Loren Culp -- a former small town police chief and unsuccessful Republican gubernatorial candidate in 2020. In a statement, Trump was scathing, calling Newhouse ""absolutely terrible"" and saying he had ""joined the Radical Left Democrats to vote for the Impeachment Hoax, angering his constituents and causing the Republican Party of Washington to totally rebuke him."" The Washington 4th district primary takes place on Aug. 2. 
'My Complete and Total Endorsement'
That rollercoaster of loyalty and recrimination is not unique to Newhouse. During this cycle, several Republican candidates have found that when it comes to Trump's support and endorsement, it can be a case of ""easy come, easy go.""
In 2019, for example, Trump nominated Tom Leonard -- a former prosecutor and Michigan House Speaker who had run unsuccessfully for Attorney General -- to be U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Michigan. His appointment was blocked by the state's two Democratic U.S. senators. When Leonard ran for Michigan Attorney General in 2022, one might reasonably have expected Trump to offer his support and encouragement once again. Instead, he enthusiastically backed Leonard's primary opponent. 
In this case, it seems that Leonard's major sin was not necessarily opposing Trump's claim to the 2020 election, or supporting his impeachment -- we couldn't find a record of any such statements by Leonard -- but simply not being as gung-ho as Trump's candidate of choice, a previously unknown attorney named Matt DePerno.
In 2020, DePerno achieved a measure of fame when he filed a lawsuit challenging the outcome of the election in Antrim County. He has been unapologetic in advancing numerous electoral conspiracy theories, and has succeeded in gaining Trump's endorsement -- an immeasurably valuable boost to a campaign that would otherwise surely have had little chance of succeeding.  
In February 2022, Trump sent a remarkable letter to Michigan GOP delegates, beseeching them to choose DePerno over Leonard, whom he dubbed ""an absolute embarrassment to the GOP,"" ""part of the Establishment for 20 years,"" and -- using his new insult of choice -- a ""RINO"" or ""Republican in Name Only.""
Two years ago, South Carolina State Rep. Nancy Mace ran as a Republican for the state's 1st Congressional District, and received the boost of a ""complete and total endorsement"" from the sitting president. When she won the Republican primary, Trump declared her ""a Great Warrior who we need in Washington now,"" and in a speech on Sept. 8, Trump addressed Mace in the audience and said, smilingly ""We're behind you a thousand percent, you know that"": 







However, the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol proved a turning point for Mace, and she appeared several times on cable news, criticizing ""fringe"" Republicans for attempting to overturn Biden's victory and cynically firing up grassroots Trump supporters. In her maiden speech after her swearing in as a House member, Mace said:
""I believe we need to hold the president accountable. I hold him accountable for the events that transpired for the attack on our Capitol last Wednesday.""

One year later, Trump was rolling out the red carpet for Mace's primary challenger Katie Arrington. In endorsing Arrington, Trump described Mace as ""absolutely horrendous"" and ""an absolutely terrible candidate ... whose remarks and attitude have been devastating for her community, and not at all representative of the Republican Party to which she has been very disloyal."" Trump offered Arrington what he had pledged to Mace less than two years earlier -- his ""complete and total endorsement.""
Pulling Strings from Mar-a-Lago
Trump himself can often be relied upon to provide an unreliable account of his own accomplishments, and we have found some intriguing examples where he has, in his endorsements, very clearly lacked the Midas touch. However, on the whole, the former president does indeed appear to be exerting a measure of strategic control and outsized influence in the GOP's primary campaign. The Ohio Senate race offers a perfect illustration of that trend. 






On Feb. 4, businessman Bernie Moreno announced he was withdrawing from the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate seat of the retiring Rob Portman. Typically, when flagging candidates pull out of elections, they mention prayerful reflection, heartfelt conversation with their loved ones, and so on. In the case of Moreno, he appears to have consulted one man, and one man only. He wrote:

I asked for a private meeting with President Trump this afternoon to discuss the state of the Ohio Senate race. I am a businessman, not a politician. Business leaders recognize patterns before they happen. After talking to President Trump we both agreed this race has too many Trump candidates and could cost the MAGA movement a conservative seat.
...Therefore, today I am ending my U.S. Senate campaign and will return to the private sector. I will focus my efforts on supporting the candidate that wins President Trump's endorsement.

In return for this act of self-sacrifice, Moreno received from Trump what the conservative columnist David Frum described as ""a pat on the head."" Trump wrote:
""I would like to thank him for his time and effort, and that of his wonderful family. I was very impressed with Bernie ...""
Eight weeks later, Trump still hasn't unveiled his endorsement in the Ohio Senate primary. 
In South Carolina's 7th Congressional District, a similar sequence of events played out. On Jan. 28, U.S. Army Veteran Graham Allen pulled out of the GOP primary to unseat incumbent Tom Rice, who was one of just 10 Republican representatives to vote in favor of Trump's second impeachment, and provoked the wrath of Trump and his supporters. 
Allen wrote:

President Trump has already endorsed against Liz Cheney and most of the other impeachment RINOs. And he will endorse against Tom Rice soon enough. When he does, we must be united.
So today, in recognition of the fact that there is now a viable candidate who is worthy of President Trump's support and who the voters' trust, I am announcing that I am immediately suspending my campaign for Congress and will give my full support to the challenger to Tom Rice that President Trump endorses.

Again, Trump promoted Allen's withdrawal announcement and added his own tribute, writing, ""Graham has a great future ahead of him!"" Three days later, Trump endorsed South Carolina State Rep. Russell Fry.
However, Trump's record as a ""candidate whisperer"" and strategist has not been flawless. In the North Carolina Senate race, for example, Trump has endorsed U.S. Rep. Ted Budd, with former Gov. Pat McCrory running as a more moderate Republican option, and former Congressman Mark Walker battling with Budd for the ""America First"" vote. 
In March 2022, Politico reported that Budd, although still polling in second place to front-runner McCrory, was losing ground to Walker. ""We gotta get Walker out of that race,"" Trump reportedly told GOP donors at a dinner. In December, according to Politico, Trump invited Walker to Mar-a-Lago and attempted to strike a deal that would see him withdraw from the primary. Walker appears to have rebuffed him and as of mid-March, he remains an active candidate, throwing a spanner in Trump's North Carolina masterplan.

82.DidOhios12thCongress,"
Conservative politicians and commentators have been making sweeping claims about voter fraud since before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, when then candidate Donald Trump inflamed groundless speculation that the election would be ""rigged"" in favor of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.
In May 2017, after his inauguration as president, Trump set up a commission on ""election integrity"" chaired by Vice President Mike Pence and run by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. Less than a year later, Trump disbanded the commission after a bipartisan backlash against requests for voter registration data, with only two meetings of the commission's members having taken place, and reportedly without uncovering any evidence of a pattern of electoral fraud in the United States.
(We have scrutinized and debunked multiple false or misleading claims and groundless conspiracy theories about alleged voter fraud, collected here.)
In August 2018, yet more misleading allegations of electoral fraud were issued, this time in the context of a special U.S. Congressional race in Ohio's 12th congressional district.
On 8 August, the right-wing web site Breitbart published an article written by Eric Eggers from the Government Accountability Institute, a conservative organization co-founded by former White House strategist Steve Bannon (who also co-founded Breitbart):
Republican Troy Balderson clings to a narrow margin in last night's special election for Ohio's 12th Congressional district, underscoring the impact voter fraud can have in key elections around the country. The separation of 1700 votes, or less than one percent, highlights the recent attempt by Democratic activists to fight efforts to prevent voter fraud from occurring ...
Consider that 170 registered voters listed as being over 116 years old still existed on the rolls of Ohio's 12th Congressional when GAI accessed the data last August. That's 10 percent of Balderson's current margin of victory, pending provisional ballots. And 72 voters over the age of 116 who ""live"" in Balderson's district cast ballots in the 2016 election.
The separation of 1700 votes, or less than one percent, highlights the recent attempt by Democratic activists to fight efforts to prevent voter fraud from occurring. For the past four years, George Soros has spent millions of dollars trying to weaken Ohio's election security by funding efforts to both block its implementation of Voter ID and prevent the state from removing inaccurate registrations.
Soros pledged $5 million to fund Clinton campaign attorney Marc Elias's efforts to fight voter ID laws in Ohio and two other states ahead of the 2016 election. Elias would file that suit in Ohio on behalf of several groups, including the Ohio Organizing Collaborative, that would have an employee sentenced to prison for voter fraud.
In 2016, liberal activist groups Demos and the ACLU filed suit against the state of Ohio in an attempt to stop its efforts to remove inaccurate voter registrations from its rolls. Soros gave 1.25 million to Demos in 2016, on top of the more than $3 million he had given in previous years. And Soros has been even more generous with the ACLU, giving over $35 million for Trump related lawsuits. 






The following day, hyperpartisan junk news web sites such as Patriotbeat.com and Truthfeednews.com republished the Breitbart article, adding: ""A newly released report is exposing more voter fraud, and this time it's happening in Ohio's 12 District where a special election battle has just been narrowly won by the GOP, thanks to President Trump.""
Analysis
Eggers' suggestion that Ohio's 12th Congressional district has an unbelieveably high preponderance of registered and voting supercentenarians, and the notion that this phenomenon is indicative of significant voter fraud, don't stand up to scrutiny.
At the time of the August 2018 Balderson-O'Connor special election, the 12th Congressional district's voter roll did include 164 registered voters ostensibly aged 116 or greater. But the catch is that all but one of those voters had a recorded birth date of either 1800-01-01 or 1900-01-01, a pattern does not suggest voter fraud but rather simple recording error. The far more likely explanation is that these voters' birthdates were not collected when they registered, or their birthdates were not properly entered into the system, or they were not transferred correctly when the voter roll management system was upgraded, and hence those birthdates ended up being set to a default value for that field in the voter database.
This alternative explanation seems even more likely when one considers that the records for some 54,935 registered voters in that Ohio district bear a registration date of 1900-01-01, an obvious impossibility for voters who weren't even born until well after that date. Again, this pattern simply suggests that some field values in voter registration records were not recorded or have since been lost, so those fields now display a placeholder value in the voter roll database.
Indeed, a press release from the Ohio Secretary of State's office confirmed that our conjecture was correct:

State law has not always required Ohioans to provide their date of birth when registering to vote. Prior to June 1974, when House Bill 662 was passed requiring date of birth to register to vote, county boards of election used placeholder dates. This is why some registrations have dates like 1900 or 1800 listed. These individuals met the requirements at the time to become registered voters and remain legally qualified electors today.

And frankly, the alternative explanation stretches credulity to breaking point: That some person(s) decided to engage in electoral fraud by creating or maintaining scores of fraudulent voter registrations, but they utterly failed to recognize or consider that anyone might think the presence of a cluster of 118- and 218-year-old voters in the same district, all of them born on 1 January, to be the least bit suspect.
Even if we embraced the discredited hypothesis that the presence of all these supercentenarian ""voters"" on the voter roll were evidence of electoral fraud, the argument that such fraud primarily favors Democrats is undercut by the fact that the party affiliation of these oddly-aged Ohio voters is fairly evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans.
Of course, it's not possible to determine whom any given registrant voted for in an election (a fraudulent voter could register as a Republican and still cast their ballot for a Democrat), but voters who register as Republicans and are recorded as having voted in Republican primaries are most likely voting for Republicans. So, the broader partisan theories espoused by Eggers about voter fraud (i.e., that fraudulent voters are predominantly Democratic voters, and that liberal or Democratic efforts to oppose ""crackdowns"" on electoral fraud are designed to protect a source of Democratic votes) aren't supported by even this demonstrably erroneous theory.

072.DidCNNDeleteanArticl,"
In June 2017, television show host Bill Maher dropped an offensive racial slur on his show ""Real Time with Bill Maher"", sparking the usual wave of opinion articles and think pieces. The Chicago Tribune looked at what could be learned from Maher's remark, the Hollywood Reporter wondered aloud if Maher had just lost his chance at winning an Emmy... and CNN wrote an article explaining why it was acceptable for Maher to use the racial slur.
Or did it?  On 3 June 2017, a web site calling itself 70News published an article appearing to report that CNN had posted -- then subsequently deleted -- an article by Laura Jarrett, daughter of Valerie Jarrett: 

CNN deleted this article written by Laura Jarrett, daughter of Obama's top adviser Valerie Jarrett : 'Bill Maher just dropped the ""N"" word, here's 5 reasons why that's okay""
After realizing nobody is going to buy their five stupid reasons, CNN decided to delete it.
Well, maybe she'll change her mind and tell us what those five reasons are, right CNN?
This obvious hoax received wide attention after it was promulgated by conservative pundits, such as Jack Posobiec and Dinesh D'Souza. Although D'Souza later issued a correction, which stated that he had been duped by a fake news article, Posobiec did not retract his claim:

It further appears that 70Newssimply put a fake title on an image of a genuine article published by Laura Jarrett. A look at the actual story article published by CNN above the doctored image shows that they have identical timestamps:

70News is not a reliable source for factual information. The WordPress site peddles little more than conspiracy theories and misinformation, and was largely responsible for spreading the (completely and demonstrably false) rumor that President Trump won the popular vote.

81.DidMichaelCohenOnceA,"
Michael Cohen, former personal attorney to U.S. President Donald Trump, became the focus of renewed scrutiny in February 2019 when he testified before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform.
This was Cohen's first Congressional testimony since he was sentenced to three years in prison for tax fraud and campaign-finance violations relating to his payment of ""hush money"" to women who alleged they had sexual relationships with Donald Trump before he became president.
Cohen also admitted he previously misled Congress when he told the House and Senate Intelligence committees that a proposed deal to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, Russia, had fallen apart in January 2016, when in fact negotiations continued until June of that year -- by which time Trump was the presumptive Republican nominee for president.
Following Cohen's dramatic 27 February testimony, some observers, including Trump himself, attempted to portray Cohen as an agent of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who was dishonestly smearing Trump on behalf of the Democratic presidential nominee whom Trump defeated in 2016.
The president highlighted the links between Clinton and Cohen's attorney, Lanny Davis, even suggesting that the former secretary of state was paying Cohen to provide damning testimony against Trump:

Michael Cohen's book manuscript shows that he committed perjury on a scale not seen before. He must have forgotten about his book when he testified. What does Hillary Clinton's lawyer, Lanny Davis, say about this one. Is he being paid by Crooked Hillary. Using her lawyer?
-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 1, 2019 






 
We couldn't find any evidence that Davis has ever acted as Clinton's personal attorney as Trump alleged, but the ties between Davis and the Clintons are longstanding. He served as a special counsel to former President Bill Clinton during the 1990s, attended Yale law school with Hillary Clinton, and was a frequent public supporter of her 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns, such as is shown in this July 2016 Fox News panel discussion:

Against that background, a meme emerged on social media in late February 2019 that claimed an even more direct historical link between Cohen and Clinton, alleging that Cohen had previously served as her personal attorney and was a ""member"" of the Clinton Foundation, a non-profit organization founded by Bill Clinton that has been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories promulgated by right-leaning opponents of the Clintons.
The meme included a photograph of Hillary Clinton standing alongside two men identified as ""Michael Cohen"" and ""Clinton Foundation Chairman"" along with text proclaiming ""Michael Cohen used to be Hillary Clinton's personal lawyer and was a member of the Clinton Foundation"":

The man identified as Cohen in the meme is indeed Cohen. The man identified as ""Clinton Foundation Chairman"" is in fact Patrick Kennedy, a Democratic former U.S. representative from Rhode Island and son of the late Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy. Kennedy has never acted as chairman of the Clinton Foundation.
The underlying photograph is authentic. Cohen himself tweeted it in June 2014, writing ""Being received by two great Americans ... Hillary Clinton and Patrick Kennedy at the Kennedy Compound"":

#tbt being received by two great Americans...Hillary Clinton and Patrick Kennedy at the Kennedy Compound pic.twitter.com/z57PXfWxfW
-- Michael Cohen (@MichaelCohen212) June 26, 2014 






 
The photograph appears to have been taken in 2004 at a fundraising event for Kennedy's re-election campaign, which was attended by then-New York Sen. Clinton as well as Cohen. Greg Ehrlich, who co-chaired the fundraiser in question, later told the Washington Post that ""It was an opportunity to say he [Cohen] went to the Kennedy compound. And he loved the Clintons. They were like rock stars. Michael was always a climber. He wanted to be the guy.""
Although they once attended the same campaign fundraiser, we could find no evidence to corroborate the claim that Cohen ever acted as Hillary Clinton's personal attorney, despite our searching federal and New York state court records as well as news archives that extend back decades.
During the 2016 presidential campaign, Cohen was publicly hostile towards Clinton, on one occasion tweeting out a meme that included the false claim she had ""murdered an ambassador"":

NBC/WSJ poll has @realDonaldTrump beating #CrookedHillary on #Honesty & #NationalSecurity. This picture says it all! pic.twitter.com/E9YKIgoqnV
-- Michael Cohen (@MichaelCohen212) June 28, 2016

On another occasion, Cohen tweeted at Clinton to say ""When you go to prison for defrauding America and perjury, your room and board will be free"":

Cohen deleted that tweet after he himself was given a three-year prison sentence for tax fraud and campaign-finance violations.
The Clinton Foundation does not have a membership structure, so it is unclear what the precise meaning is of the claim that Cohen was a ""member"" of the Clinton Foundation, but we also found no evidence that he has ever had any formal or informal association with that organization.
We contacted representatives for Hillary Clinton, the Clinton Foundation, and Michael Cohen in order to definitively clarify the veracity of the February 2019 meme, but unfortunately none of them responded in time for publication. For that reason, we issue a rating of ""Unproven.""

173.TheshipthatwasstuckintheSuezCanalwasaplannedorstagedevent,"
Egyptian authorities successfully removed a 1,300-foot cargo ship that got stuck in the Suez Canal and created a shipping traffic jam for days. 
The shipping route that connects the Red Sea and Mediterranean Sea is critical for global trade, and the incident has launched a host of conspiracy theories including one that maintains the entire thing was staged so that the ""deep state"" could explain away impending higher inflation. 
""My hot take: the Suez Canal is the next false flag psyop to explain hyper inflation and the upcoming collapse of the global system,"" a caption on Instagram reads. 
The post features several other claims about the blockage being intentional, with the first saying, ""Well the deep state and their media have to sell us some bs story for whatever else they have planned next. I don't buy the story. But I do believe they are doing something to deviously hurtful to the nation.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
This was not a staged event. The Evergreen Line is the trade name for the five shipping companies owned by the Evergreen Group, a Taiwan shipping conglomerate. An Ever Given ship, one of the largest ocean vessels in the world, got stuck in a bank of the canal on March 23 during a dust storm with high winds.

While a six-day blockage along the maritime route is rare, groundings are the most common cause of shipping incidents in the canal, with 25 in the past 10 years, according to global business insurer Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty SE.
The strong winds are widely seen as a major factor in this incident. But the Washington Post reported that the Suez Canal Authority said the investigation will not focus just on the weather, and that human and technical errors cannot be ruled out.
The incident received around-the-clock news coverage by countless media organizations all over the world and efforts to free the ship involved many people and dozens of organizations. 
The Evergreen Line released updates as the grounding situation unfolded, and on March 25 said it would ""continue to coordinate with the shipowner and Suez Canal Authority to deal with the situation with the utmost urgency, ensuring the resumption of the voyage as soon as possible and to mitigate the effects of the incident."" 
Crews used tugboats, large-capacity dredgers and high tides to excavate and pull the ship from the canal's banks. The vessel was freed by around-the-clock digging (workers removed approximately 30,000 cubic meters of sand) and tugs that pushed and pulled it into the middle of the channel.
Ever Given's owner and insurers could face claims for loss of revenue and from other ships whose passage was disrupted, insurers and brokers told Reuters.

193.QAnonandDonaldTrumpr,"
At President Donald Trump's recent Florida rally, ""Q"" stood out.
Among Trump supporters wearing signature red MAGA hats were others donning white t-shirts with a large printed ""Q"" and raising signs that said: ""We are Q.""
Who, or what, is Q?
It traces back to an anonymous online persona claiming to be a government insider on a mission to expose the ""deep state"" allegedly working against Trump.
Q's vague and cryptic ""breadcrumbs"" posted on fringe online forums have become fodder for a wide-ranging conspiracy theory embraced by Trump's supporters that casts him as victorious over evil forces.

The term ""QAnon"" has been used in reference to Q and its followers and to describe the broad conspiracy theory and movement.
It's not entirely unusual for followers of conspiracy theories to attend Trump's rallies -- Trump himself is known for promoting such theories. But it was jarring to see a physical representation at an event for a U.S. president.
Here's a closer look at the QAnon phenomenon making its way from online forums to Trump rallies.

Q's unclear message
Q's posts started last fall. The Q in its anonymous name is billed as a reference to a security clearance needed for high-level government information.
It's difficult to figure out Q's exact message, and varying plot lines exist. But the general idea is that presidents before Trump were conspiring with evil groups, including pedophile rings, and that the military convinced Trump to run for president in order to stop them, The Daily Beast reporter Will Sommer wrote in a July 6 article.
The belief is that the alleged perpetrators will end up in prison at the coming of ""the storm."" The ""storm"" latches on to comments Trump made to reporters in October during a photo opportunity with senior military officers: ""You guys know what this represents? Maybe it's the calm before the storm.""
The conspiracy theory is far-fetched and unproven. But the QAnon movement is compelling to some people because it's like a puzzle, said Kathryn Olmsted, a history professor at the University of California, Davis.
""The alleged leaker puts out clues for his followers to decode. And they work with one another to figure it out,"" she said. ""That's very appealing.""
In their view, Olmsted said, ""there's a group of insiders who control the U.S. government, and brave citizens need to uncover the truth to stop them.""
The nuggets of information Q leaves are abstract enough that they can't necessarily be disproven, said Mark Fenster, a law professor at the University of Florida.
He offered this example: When Trump at a July White House meeting was saying he had ""full faith"" in the U.S. intelligence agencies, the lights briefly went out in the room.
Fenster said some connected that to a ""dark to light"" QAnon clue. Q reportedly has used that phrase in several drops, including one that said: ""Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. A week to remember. Dark to light. Blackout necessary. Q.""
As the lights went out and back on, Trump said: ""Whoops, they just turned off the light. That must be the intelligence agencies."" He called the incident ""strange.""
The QAnon conspiracy theory appeal
Usually, people who support the losing candidate in an election are more inclined to believe conspiracy theories, Olmsted said, but in this case it's the winning side that's embracing these theories.
QAnon ""is hitting the nail in the head"" for Trump supporters, said Joseph Uscinski, a political science associate professor at the University of Miami.
""Conspiracy theories are believed by people who are already predisposed,"" Uscinski said. ""It matches their dispositions.""
Actress Roseanne Barr and former baseball player Curt Schilling, both Trump supporters, seem to back the QAnon conspiracy, posting links about it on their social media pages.
Conspiracy theories aren't just limited to Trump's supporters, however. Everyone is susceptible.
Many people who oppose Trump are extremely interested on whether Putin has compromising material on Trump, said Fenster, the UF professor. In order to prove this, many spend a lot of time reading about Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort believing there's a conspiracy afoot, he said.
""It's important to understand that people on the right and left have their own theories and when they believe (a conspiracy theory), they believe it because they think it's true,"" Uscinski said.
How conspiracy theories can encourage action
In the short term, conspiracy theories could prompt violent attacks against government officials or buildings, which is what happened in Oklahoma City in the 1990s, said Olmsted, the UC Davis professor. Because the latest theories are against the government, they make it hard for the government and democratic process to function.
In June, an armed man drove an armored vehicle to the Hoover Dam and blocked traffic. He had a sign that said ""Release the OIG report."" The Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General had already released a report related to the conduct of FBI officials during the investigation of Clinton's emails.
But followers of the QAnon conspiracy theory believed there was a second, more damning report that would expose the ""deep state."" Police arrested the man and no one was injured. The Las Vegas Review-Journal in July reported that the man faces terrorism charges and has written letters from jail to Trump and other elected officials. While his letters don't explain a motive, they include a signoff popular among QAnon followers, the newspaper reported.
Before QAnon, there was Pizzagate. The Pizzagate conspiracy theory spread online before Election Day after WikiLeaks released emails of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager. Online forum users noticed that Podesta corresponded with the owner of Comet Ping Pong pizzeria in Washington to discuss a potential Clinton fundraiser.
A fake theory emerged claiming that Podesta's repeated use of the word ""pizza"" in emails was actually a code word for pedophilia, and that the pizzeria was allegedly the base for secret rooms in which Clinton and her allies kidnapped and imprisoned children to be sexually abused, tortured or even sacrificed in the name of Satan. The theory alleged Democrats in both Clinton's campaign and the federal government colluded to hide the abuse.
In December 2016, a North Carolina man entered the pizzeria with an assault rifle to ""self-investigate"" the claims. Police said the man pointed his gun at a worker (who fled) and then started firing the rifle inside the restaurant. The suspect surrendered to police and there were no reported injuries.
In the long term, anti-government conspiracy theories threaten democracy.
""These theories could undermine faith in the electoral process,"" Olmsted said. ""The losing side could refuse to concede.""
Trump's own dance with conspiracy theories
While conspiracy theories have been around throughout American history, what's new now is that the president himself supports these theories, which elevates them in politics and pop culture.
""That's unprecedented,"" Olmsted said.
A conspiracy theory often repeated by Trump is that there's been widespread voter fraud in California and other places, which explains his loss in the popular vote to Clinton. (Pants on Fire)
The false claim that 3 million votes in the presidential election were cast by people in the country illegally was peddled by the conspiracy-minded website, Infowars, run by Alex Jones. Trump appeared on Jones's show in 2015 while campaigning for the presidency and toward the end of the interview, Trump said, ""Your reputation is amazing.""
""Alex Jones used to be on the paranoid margins; now he claims that he inspires the president of the United States,"" Olmsted said. ""Trump is giving credibility to fringe figures and theories.""
Some of Trump's conspiracies pre-date his presidency.
-- Trump for years promoted a debunked theory that President Barack Obama was born in Kenya and thus ineligible to be president. After falsely claiming Clinton and her 2008 campaign started the birther controversy, Trump said, ""I finished it. I finished it. You know what I mean. President Barack Obama was born in the United States. Period."" (Full Flop)
-- He said that in the Philippines more than a century ago, Gen. John Pershing ""took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs' blood,"" and shot 49 Muslim rebels. ""The 50th person, he said, 'You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened.' And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem."" (Pants on Fire)
-- He said Sen. Ted Cruz's father ""was with Lee Harvey Oswald"" before the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. (Pants on Fire)
-- He said, ""I watched in Jersey City, N.J., where thousands and thousands of people were cheering"" as the World Trade Center collapsed. (Pants on Fire)
After the Tampa rally, White House reporters asked press secretary Sarah Sanders whether Trump ""encouraged the support of people who showed up last night in these QAnon and Blacks for Trump fringe groups.""
""The president condemns and denounces any group that would incite violence against another individual, and certainly doesn't support groups that would promote that type of behavior,"" Sanders said at the Aug. 1 briefing.

65.MyPillowCEOLindellsf,"
Before MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell's documentary aired on the One America News Network, a disclaimer rolled slowly across the screen: 
""The statements and claims expressed in this program are presented at this time as opinions only and are not intended to be taken or interpreted by the viewer as established facts.""
The disclaimer cut a sharp contrast with the program's title: ""Absolute Proof.""
Does Lindell's documentary provide what the title promises? No.
The video, which clocks in at about two hours, rehashes old conspiracy theories, touching on claims that have been repeatedly debunked by state and local officials, thrown out by the courts and contradicted by federal agencies. 
The film, which Lindell produced over the past five days, has a chaotic and often perplexing style. Ominous music phases in and out as Lindell and his guests speak. Several interviews are punctuated by abrupt fades to black. At one point a hammer and sickle flashes on the screen.
Over the course of the video, Lindell interviews a series of ""cyber forensic experts,"" many of whom Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani featured as witnesses during his long campaign to overturn the election. Lindell's guests include Russell Ramsland, a former Republican congressional candidate who authored an error-ridden affidavit that mistook Minnesota voting precincts for Michigan ones; Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai, who has spread conspiracy theories in the past and continues to call himself the inventor of email despite heavy pushback from technology experts; and Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney, who has falsely claimed that COVID-19 was a biological weapon.
We received many requests to take a look at Lindell's documentary. The film has already been removed from Vimeo and YouTube. Dominion Voting Machines, the company at the heart of the video's allegations, has threatened to sue Lindell for his baseless claims of voter fraud involving their machines. 
Fact-checked here are six of the many misleading claims included in the film.
Lindell: ""These (voting) machines were used to steal our elections by other countries, including China.""
This is False. There is no evidence that the Chinese Communist Party interfered in the 2020 election. 
All 50 states and the District of Columbia have certified their election results, which Congress finalized on Jan. 7. There is no credible evidence that voter fraud affected President Joe Biden's win. 
Here's how we know that:


Election officials in every state have said there was no sign of significant voter fraud during the voting process. 


The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, called CISA, and its election partners called the 2020 election ""the most secure in American history.""


Former Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department uncovered no evidence of widespread fraud.


Not one of the more than 60 lawsuits that President Donald Trump and his allies filed in state and federal courts proved that voter fraud affected the election outcome.


In a rumor control page on its website, CISA said that bad actors would not be able to change election results without being caught. Dominion, a voting technology company that was targeted by disinformation after the election, said on its website that it has no ties to the Chinese government.
Lindell: ""On election night, 11:15 at night, the algorithms of these (voting) machines broke ... Donald Trump got so many more millions of votes that they didn't expect, that they're going to have to go recalibrate, right? So that's why all these states shut down. All of a sudden they all shut down. And we're all going, 'What? That's weird, this has never happened in any other election.'""
This is False. Delays with the vote count were due to an influx of mail-in ballots, spurred by the coronavirus pandemic. In several states, processing the mail-in ballots took longer than counting Election Day voting. 
Battleground states did not stop counting votes on election night when Trump was ahead to swing the election to Biden. 
Lindell: 4,296 Georgia voters ""registered to vote in another state after their Georgia registration date.""
False. This number comes from an analysis conducted by Matt Braynard, a former Trump campaign staffer. Braynard arrived at the number by comparing Georgia registration and voting lists with the U.S. Postal Service change-of-address data. 
Braynard's methods have been strongly criticized by election experts and statisticians. In an analysis of Braynard's findings, Harvard professor and voting statistics expert Stephen Ansolabehere wrote that ""the report offers no conclusions based on scientifically accepted standards of evidence"" and that parts of the report were ""riddled with errors and biases that render it invalid for purposes of drawing inferences about the quantities at issue.""
A Georgia state representative documented that many voters on his list actually lived in the state.  When questioned by the lawmaker, Braynard backpedaled on some of his conclusions. He claimed that he had only listed ""potentially illegal"" voters and that he was not accusing any of the people on his list of breaking the law. 
In a Jan. 2 phone call with Trump, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said that Braynard's data was wrong and that only two dead people voted in the election. 
Col. Phil Waldron: ""We were mapping out the servers before the elections. We identified the Scytl server in Frankfurt down to the street address.""
This is not based in fact. Scytl, a software company based in Barcelona, has no offices in Germany, according to its website. 
In a statement rejecting the claims, Scytl said that its technologies for the U.S. are hosted and managed domestically by a Tampa-based subsidiary, SOE Software, and that it does not provide any voting machines in the U.S. or online voting services for U.S. elections.
Scytl and Dominion share no ties, according to statements from both companies.
Lindell: ""15,000 people in Antrim County, Mich., voted, and 7,000 votes flipped.""
False. The scrutiny of Antrim's ballots arises from an error in the reporting of unofficial results on election night, which initially showed voters in the heavily GOP county casting more votes for Biden than for Trump. Trump allies have seized on that error, and other alleged irregularities, in their fruitless quest for evidence of election rigging through equipment made by Dominion. 
State and county officials say the reporting error, which was corrected soon after the election, was the result of human error by County Clerk Sheryl Guy, a Republican, before the election.
Trump, not Biden, won Antrim County.
Col. Phil Waldron: ""We have got documented Chinese Communist Party ownership of the private equity firm whose board controls Dominion. The president of the Chinese Communist Bank who is a board of directors member of the private equity firm that owns Dominion. ... The (CCP) does have access to the Dominion code.""
Fact-checkers have debunked multiple falsehoods about Dominion Voting, a company that was targeted with misinformation after the election. Dominion, which makes voting machines, was founded in 2003 and has headquarters in Denver and Toronto. The company said on its website that it has no ties to the Chinese government and that it is an American company that provides voting systems in 28 states, including in red and blue jurisdictions. We found no evidence that the company has ties to the Chinese Communist Party.
USA Today found the claim of Chinese investment in Dominion Voting Systems confuses UBS subsidiaries and rated false a claim that China invested $400 million in Dominion Voting System. The Associated Press also found no truth to the claim that ""Communist China"" purchased Dominion.
Lindell: ""17,000 dead voters in Michigan""
This is false. Trump made a similar statement during the Jan. 6 Save America rally.
There is no evidence that dead people voted in Michigan's election, our Michigan partner at the Detroit Free Press found. Michigan relies on Social Security Administration death records to flag deceased voters and maintain the integrity of voter files. In the November election, the state identified ballots cast by 3,469 people who had passed away between casting their ballot and the election.
We also debunked a viral tweet that over 14,000 votes in Wayne County were cast by dead people. According to the state's voter database, several of the individuals on the list are shown as never having cast an absentee ballot, and at least one woman listed seems to still be alive.

53.DidBrettKavanaughNev,"
In the autumn of 2018, President Donald Trump's nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court dominated news cycles after three women publicly accused him of sexual assault or sexual misconduct during his high school and college years.
Those women, in particular Kavanaugh's principal accuser Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, faced a torrent of personal attacks and malicious misinformation, but Judge Kavanaugh himself also came in for criticism, largely in relation to his historical consumption of alcohol and his personality, but also on the basis of his past pronouncements and suitability for a federal judgeship.
On 2 October, the anti-Trump, pro-labor union Facebook page ""Union Thugs"" posted a meme which alleged that Kavanaugh, prior to his appointment as a federal judge in 2006, was desperately lacking in trial experience and had been promoted directly from the position of law clerk to a seat on the federal bench:
How many of us knew Kavanaugh had never tried a case in a regular court? He was a law clerk promoted to a Judge by Bush. 
  






This claim has two components. The first part, that Kavanaugh was promoted directly from law clerk to federal judge, leaves out significant portions of Kavanaugh's background and professional history. The second part, that Kavanaugh had never tried a case before being nominated for a judgeship in 2003, is mostly accurate. 
In June 2006, Kavanaugh was sworn in as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, commonly known as the ""DC Circuit."" In welcoming him into the role, then-President George W. Bush said:
Over his career, he's argued cases before the Supreme Court, appellate courts, and trial courts. He has given his time and talent to provide legal services for those in need. He's earned a reputation for integrity and independence. Brett's abilities and professionalism have been recognized by members of both political parties. After I nominated Brett, a bipartisan group of his law school classmates wrote a letter of support saying Brett would bring credit to the distinguished court to which he has been nominated ...
In the history of the DC Circuit, no judge has undergone a more thorough and rigorous confirmation process. And all who watched this process saw what I know: that he's a man of fairness, humility, and a reverence for the laws and the Constitution of our country.

A few days earlier, the U.S. Senate had voted 57-36 to confirm Kavanaugh to the position, with 53 Republicans and four Democrats supporting his nomination, 35 Democrats and one Independent opposing it, and seven senators not voting.
Opponents of Kavanaugh's confirmation had highlighted his alleged lack of experience and close ties to Bush, with the late Democratic icon Ted Kennedy saying, in a Senate debate:
Unlike most of the members of the DC Circuit, Brett Kavanaugh is not a judge, an experienced litigator, or a legal scholar. Far from it. Mr. Kavanaugh is a political operative, a man whose ambition has placed him at the center of some of the most politically divisive events in recent memory. He is not qualified for this position. If his nomination is approved, I can say with confidence that Mr. Kavanaugh would be the youngest, least experienced and most partisan appointee to the court in decades.
Mr. Kavanaugh blatantly lacks the broad legal experience that is the hallmark of federal judges -- particularly those at the highest levels. He has never tried a case to verdict or to judgment. In fact, Mr. Kavanaugh has only practiced law for ten years. Even counting his time as a law clerk, he still has only half of the average legal experience of nominees to the DC Circuit. To put this in context, Mr. Kavanaugh would be the least experienced member of the DC Circuit in almost a quarter century.
His lack of experience is underscored by his responses to questions from [Senate] Judiciary Committee members. When he was asked to name his 10 most significant cases, Mr. Kavanaugh could only cite five cases for which he actually appeared in court, and only two cases in which he was lead counsel. He even cited two cases for which he merely wrote a friend-of-the-court brief for someone who was not a party to the lawsuit. 






In referring to Kavanaugh's role in ""some of the most politically divisive events in recent memory,"" Kennedy almost certainly meant the 2000 Florida recount and Independent Counsel Ken Starr's investigation into the Whitewater scandal, which expanded to cover President Bill Clinton's affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and ultimately yielded grounds for the unsuccessful impeachment of Clinton.
In the mid-1990s, Kavanaugh took part in the Clinton investigations led by Starr, for whom he had worked in 1992 and 1993 when Starr was U.S. Solicitor General. In 1999, the New York Times described Kavanaugh as having been one of ""the most important lawyers on the Lewinsky inquiry.""
During this period, Kavanaugh controversially re-investigated the death of Vince Foster, Clinton's White House Counsel, despite the fact that several official investigations had already concluded that Foster shot himself to death in 1993. (Since it took place, Foster's death has become the subject of rampant conspiracy theories implicating Bill and Hillary Clinton, about which more can be read here.)
Furthermore, Kavanaugh was involved in writing up parts of the second half of Starr's eventual report to Congress, which outlined the grounds for Clinton's impeachment. Kavanaugh later expressed regret that Congress had decided to publish the entire report, which included intimate details of Clinton and Lewinsky's sexual relationship, without reviewing it in advance.
In late 2000, Kavanaugh joined the legal team of then-Texas governor George W. Bush as the contested results of the presidential election in Florida went before the U.S. Supreme Court.
'A law clerk promoted to a judge'
Before his confirmation as a judge on the DC Circuit in 2006, Kavanaugh had the following experience (in reverse chronological order):

2003-2006: White House Staff Secretary
2003: Senior Associate White House Counsel
2001-2003: Associate White House Counsel
1997-2001: Partner at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis
1994-1998: Associate Counsel with the Office of lndependent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr
1993-1994: Law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy
1992-1993: Attorney with the Office of the U.S. Solicitor General
1992: Summer associate at the law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson
1991-1992: Law clerk to U.S. Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit judge Alex Kozinski
1990-1991: Law clerk to U.S. Court of Appeals, Third Circuit judge Walter Stapleton
1990: Summer associate at the law firm Williams & Connolly
 






Bush first nominated Kavanaugh to the DC Circuit in February 2003, but concerns over Kavanaugh's relative lack of experience and partisanship triggered a protracted filibuster by Congressional Democrats.
In 2003, an American Bar Association (ABA) committee gave Kavanaugh its highest rating of ""well qualified"" for a position on the DC Circuit. However, the committee re-evaluated him in 2005 and 2006 and, on the latter occasion, downgraded their rating to ""qualified.""
As the ABA explained, a rating of ""qualified"" still means that ""The nominee meets the Committee's very high standards with respect to integrity, professional competence and judicial temperament and that the Committee believes that the nominee will be able to perform satisfactorily all of the duties and responsibilities required by the high office of a federal judge.""
In 2006, the ABA committee, which is responsible for evaluating federal judicial candidates, wrote that Kavanaugh ""enjoys a solid reputation for integrity, intellectual capacity, and writing and analytical ability"" and a majority of the committee's 15 members rated him ""qualified,"" with a minority rating him ""well qualified"" and none of them deeming him ""not qualified.""
However, the committee outlined two major reasons why they had downgraded their endorsement of Kavanaugh between 2003 and 2006 -- increased concerns over his putative lack of experience as a lawyer, and new concerns over his judicial temperament, in particular his ability to remain impartial as a judge:
From the outset in 2003, even with an earlier rating of ""Well Qualified"" for this nominee, there were considerations arising from confidential interviews and other background information that act to explain the thread of ""Qualified"" running through the Standing Committee evaluations. The 2003 confidential record makes it clear that there were then-present concerns regarding this nominee's breadth of professional experience.
It was noted that he had never tried a case to verdict or judgment; that his litigation experience over the years was always in the company of senior counsel; and that he had very little experience with criminal cases. Indeed, it is the circumstance of courtroom experience that fills the transcripts that make the record before the Court of Appeals, and concerns were expressed about the nominee's insight into that very process. Nonetheless, a substantial majority saw other overriding factors that supported a rating of ""Well Qualified.""
The additional interviews conducted in 2006 expanded upon those earlier concerns. One judge who witnessed the nominee's oral presentation in court commented that the nominee was ""less than adequate"" before the court, had been ""sanctimonious,"" and demonstrated ""experience on the level of an associate.""A lawyer who had observed him during a different court proceeding stated: ""Mr. Kavanaugh did not handle the case well as an advocate and dissembled."" Other lawyers expressed similar concerns, repeating in substance that the nominee was young and inexperienced in the practice of law.
Further, the 2006 interviews raised a new concern involving his potential for judicial temperament. Unlike the earlier 2003 final report and 2005 updated report, the recent supplemental evaluation contained comments from several interviewees with more recent experience with the nominee, which caused them to characterize the nominee as ""insulated.""
One interviewee suggested that much of his concern about the nominee's being insulated was due, understandably, to the nominee's current position as Staff Secretary to the President. However, this interviewee remained concerned about the nominee's ability to be balanced and fair should he assume a federal judgeship. And another interviewee echoed essentially the same thoughts: ""(He is) immovable and very stubborn and frustrating to deal with on some issues.""
Twelve years later, on 30 August 2018, the ABA committee's 15 members voted unanimously to give Kavanaugh a rating of ""well qualified"" for the position of U.S. Supreme Court justice, concluding: ""Judge Kavanaugh meets the highest standards of integrity, professional competence, and judicial temperament.""
However, after a U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Dr. Christine Blasey Ford outlined her allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh, and Kavanaugh defended himself, ABA president Bob Carlson wrote a letter on 27 September urging the Senate committee to postpone any vote on confirming Kavanaugh until the Federal Bureau of Investigation had completed an investigation into the sexual assault allegations. 






It's clear that President Bush did not promote Kavanaugh directly from a law clerk to a federal judge, as the meme claims. Notwithstanding his inexperience as a trial lawyer or judge, Kavanaugh's last clerkship ended in 1994, nine years before Bush nominated him to the DC Circuit and 12 years before he was confirmed to it. In those intervening years, Kavanaugh worked (albeit almost entirely outside the courtroom) on some high-profile cases and investigations, and at the highest levels of the executive branch.
'Never tried a case in a regular court'
It's not clear what the meme means by ""regular court,"" but let's take a look at Kavanaugh's overall courtroom and trial experience before his nomination to the DC Circuit in 2003, and his appointment in 2006.
In July 2003, Kavanaugh responded to written questions put to him by the Senate Judiciary Committee after his nomination by President Bush. A few questions hit directly on his experience (or lack thereof) as a trial lawyer:
17 c. 1. Did you appear in court frequently, occasionally, or not at all? If the frequency of your appearances in court varied, describe each such variance, giving dates.
Occasionally. In both public service and private practice, I argued a number of appellate matters and also conducted legal arguments in district court.
c. 3. What percentage of these appearances was in: (a) federal courts; approximately 90% (b) state courts of record; approximately 10% (c) other courts. [None]
c. 4. State the number of cases in courts of record you tried to verdict or judgment (rather than settled), indicating whether you were sole counsel, chief counsel, or associate counsel.
None, as I have not been a trial lawyer. I have worked on legal issues and appeals in both public service and private practice and argued in court, including the Supreme Court of the United States, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, federal district courts, and state courts.
c. 5. What percentage of these trials was: (a) jury; (b) non-jury. Not applicable.
""I have not been a trial lawyer"" is the key takeaway from these answers. By his own admission, Kavanaugh had never appeared in any court below the state or federal level, and had never been the lead attorney in a trial of any kind, whether civil or criminal, which supports the ""Union Thugs"" statement that he ""had never tried a case.""
Kavanaugh did take part in the preparation of some components of some significant court cases, and he did on a few occasions make oral arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court, the DC Circuit itself, other federal appeals courts, and state courts. As part of his 2003 questionnaire response, Kavanaugh outlined his role in some significant cases, including a couple related to the Vince Foster investigation and Ken Starr's Clinton probe.
Despite his work on these cases, Kavanaugh had not tried a case in court from start to finish by the time he was nominated by President Bush in 2003 to take his place on the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. This component of the ""Union Thugs"" meme is therefore accurate.

In early August 2020, social media users reported that Facebook had banned posts using the hashtag #SavetheChildren, leading Snopes readers to inquire about whether the censorship had occurred, and why the platform would choose to block such posts.
While it is true that Facebook temporarily disabled #SavetheChildren posts that violated community standards or showed depictions of child abuse, the platform did not permanently ban the hashtag. This claim is outdated.
Facebook posts using #SavetheChildren were reportedly banned or censored from Aug. 5, 2020, until the early morning of the next day. Publications and users reported that statuses could still be shared, but posts that had used the hashtag did not show results. Instead, they returned a warning that the post violated community standards.
In an email to Snopes, Facebook confirmed that the hashtag had been temporarily disabled.
""We temporarily blocked the hashtag as it was surfacing low-quality content,"" wrote Dami Oyefeso, a Facebook spokesperson. ""The hashtag has since been restored, and we will continue to monitor for content that violates our Community Standards.""

A Snopes search on both the mobile and desktop versions of Facebook revealed that the hashtag had been reinstated as of this publication. Search results included a variety of disinformation and misrepresented facts and events surrounding pedophilia rings, as well as potentially triggering images of children being abused, exploited, or presented in situations that suggest sexual exploitation.
Social media users speculated that the temporary disabling of the hashtag was because many of the images associated with #SavetheChildren violated Facebook community standards, which have a specific rationale for any content related to minors that include ""imagery that depicts non-sexual child abuse regardless of sharing intent.""
Some believe that some social media users have abused the hashtag as a way to spread anti-mask sentiment in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of social media influencers have argued that children wearing masks may be at a heightened risk of abduction or less likely to be spotted after having been kidnapped. Others have connected mask mandates to the ""global elite and their fetish for children.""
Save the Children is a humanitarian organization that provides education and social services to children around the world. Bill and Melinda Gates donated to the organization and conspiracy theorists and tabloids have connected Bill Gates with convicted sex offender and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.

54.IsChristineBlaseyFor,"
National events have a tendency to draw out conspiracy theories about billionaire philanthropist George Soros, and the controversy over the U.S. Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh proved no different.
Shortly after Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, a California college professor, came forward with allegations that Kavanaugh had attempted to rape her when the two were in high school, a menagerie of junk news sites and internet conspiracy theorists alike began to scour the web for ""links"" between her and  Soros. And because George Soros is the founder and chair of the Open Society Foundation, which donates to many varied organizations and causes, loose ""links"" were inevitably found. Many turned out to be bogus, and even one that was based on some accurate information was spun in a misleading way.
On 17 September 2018, Frontpage Mag, a web site operated by the ultra-conservative David Horowitz Freedom Center, reported in a headline that ""KAVANAUGH ACCUSER'S LAWYER IS VICE CHAIR OF SOROS FUNDED ORG OPPOSING KAVANAUGH"":

Kavanaugh's accuser is being represented by Debra Katz, a Washington D.C., lawyer and the vice chair of the board of the Project On Government Oversight.
POGO co-signed a letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein and Senator Grassley along with a variety of lefty groups demanding Kavanaugh records. This was the obstruction tactic of choice of the left for trying to secure the Court seat before they fastened on to this latest smear.
Where does PGO gets its funding?
From, among other sources, George Soros and his Open Society Foundation tentacles.

(The Frontpage Mag story was the source for a subsequent, widely-quoted opinion piece published by the Washington Times, which more or less rehashed it with an extra helping of Soros paranoia.) 






It's true that Debra Katz has served as an attorney for Dr. Ford,  and she has indeed also served for years as vice chair of the board for the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit that advocates for government transparency and accountability. But claims about the organization's funding and position on Kavanaugh's confirmation have been distorted.
POGO does receive some funding from the Open Society Foundation, but it also receives funding from a multitude of other sources as well. In 2016, POGO listed a donation in excess of $100,000 from the Open Society Foundation, while also reporting a donation of more than $25,000 from the conservative Charles Koch Foundation -- both relatively very small proportions of the more than $2.7 million in revenue the organization took in from all sources that year.
It's also true that the organization signed on to an 8 August 2018 letter addressed to Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and ranking member Dianne Feinstein (D-California), requesting that all senators on the committee be given equal access to documents pertinent to the nominee and expressing concern that the Republican majority had been given preferential treatment. Other groups that signed the letter included the Campaign for Accountability, Human Rights Watch, the National Coalition Against Censorship, the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, and the National Security Archive.
But POGO spokesman Tim Farnsworth told us POGO is non-partisan and has not taken a position supporting or opposing Kavanaugh's confirmation: ""I think it's ridiculous to use one funding source for the organization to draw a conspiracy, when we have over 50 foundations and grant makers supporting us,"" he said.
Farnsworth said Katz serves on the organization's board not because of any political views she may hold, but because as an attorney she specializes in representing and protecting government whistleblowers.
We sent Frontpage Mag writer Daniel Greenfield questions about whether the headline was still accurate in light of POGO's rebuttal, why he used the term ""tentacle"" to describe Soros's charitable foundation activities, and why Katz's long-standing membership on POGO's board was considered newsworthy. He replied:

A variety of Soros funded organizations have been highly active in the battle against Kavanaugh. It's therefore newsworthy that POGO has received funding from a politically influential billionaire whose activism has shaped and reshaped national politics. While POGO is officially non-partisan, it has signed on to a letter alongside heavily partisan groups that have taken a strong position against Kavanaugh intended to stymie his progress.
Tentacle refers to the tendency of organizations funded by Soros to be politically and financially intertwined while serving common goals. This phenomenon has been noted in a variety of countries, some of which have targeted legislation against the politically influential billionaire.
This entire discussion has been overtaken by current events. Ford now has a number of clear Democrat partisan figures around her making the debate over partisan leanings on this matter, moot.

Greenfield didn't explain why he didn't consider it equally newsworthy that POGO has also received funding from Charles Koch, a conservative politically influential billionaire whose activism has shaped and reshaped national politics, or use the word ""tentacle"" to describe Koch's charitable activities. 






Open Society Foundation spokeswoman Laura Silver told us the OSF works on behalf of public causes that promote increasing overall social equality and quality of life:

The Open Society Foundations' work in the US is centered around four goals: promoting a more inclusive and accountable democracy; a fair criminal justice system; full political, economic and civic participation of communities of color and immigrants; and equitable economic growth.
It's one of the largest programs in the foundations, and covers a lot of issues, as you might imagine. To give you a sampling, based on topics in the news these days: the foundations' US Programs staff works to end mass incarceration, advance voting rights, close the racial wealth gap; promote the rule of law, and address drug use through community- and health-based systems, rather than the criminal justice system.

The implications of invoking George Soros' name in relation to Dr. Ford is meant to imply that Ford was motivated to come forward solely for politically partisan reasons, but we found no evidence that is the case.
The conspiratorial fixation with Soros often takes hold after mass casualty incidents: he is often the target of fantastical allegations that he orchestrates ""false flag"" events. It also becomes prominent when a political controversy sweeps the country, as with the Kavanaugh confirmation process. Because the causes that the Soros foundation supports are often progressive in nature, he's regularly invoked as right wing's boogeyman.  David Horowitz, for example authored a book entitled The Shadow Party: How George Soros, Hillary Clinton, and Sixties Radicals Seized Control of the Democratic Party, summarized thusly via online retailer Amazon:
Radical infiltrators have been quietly transforming America's societal, cultural, and political institutions for more than a generation. Now, backed by George Soros, they are ready to make their move. These ""progressive"" extremists have gained control over a once-respectable but now desperate and dangerous political party. From their perches in the Democratic hierarchy, they seek to undermine the war on terror, destabilize the nation, and effect radical ""regime change"" in America.
As the Anti-Defamation League noted, the more extreme the source of the Soros conspiracy theory, the more likely it will take on an air of hate:

In mainstream conservative discourse, Hungarian Jewish billionaire, Holocaust survivor and philanthropist George Soros is often portrayed as a potent force behind liberal and progressive causes. In far right circles, this belief often veers into outsized conspiracy theories, including claims that he directly funds specific protests or in other ways manipulates events to further his goals. These conspiracy theories sometimes take on an anti-Semitic cast, especially when they associate Soros' actions with his Jewish identity, incorporate elements of classic anti-Semitic tropes like control of governments, banks and media, or accuse him of orchestrating false flags events ...

3.NoPfizerDoesNotOwnNe,"
In early 2022, folk-rock legend Neil Young found himself the target of a laughable conspiracy theory after he spoke out against COVID-19-related misinformation. On Jan. 24, Young wrote that he wanted his music removed from the streaming platform Spotify, unless the company ended its agreement to host Joe Rogan's podcast, which has on several occasions provided a forum for potentially harmful misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. In response, Spotify removed Young's back catalog from its library, rather than cutting ties with Rogan. 
In the midst of that controversy, vaccine skeptics and COVID-19 conspiracy theorists shared a ludicrous conspiracy theory claiming that the pharmaceutical company Pfizer -- which produces a widely-used COVID-19 vaccine -- either owned the rights to Young's music catalog or, through a chain of connections, held sway over the rock star and influenced, or even ordered, his pro-vaccination stance. 
For example, some social media users posted a meme with the text, ""When you realize Neil Young's music catalogue is owned by Pfizer"":

Others did not explicitly claim that Pfizer itself owned some or all of Young's catalog, but did suggest that the company held sway over him, by way of a series of connections, and that therefore Young's opposition to Rogan and his criticism of vaccine misinformation should be dismissed as the result of corruption and self-compromise, rather than a principled stance.  






On social media, a conspiracy theorist who uses the moniker An0maly outlined the theory in helpful detail, starting with the observation that in January 2021, Young reportedly sold half of his catalog to a U.K.-based investment fund called Hipgnosis, for around $150 million. An0maly continued:
So, 50% to UK investment fund Hipgnosis. In October of 2021, Blackstone and Hipgnosis Song Management launched [a] ""$1 billion partnership to invest in songs, recorded music, music IP and royalties."" Interesting. Blackstone is ""an American alternative investment management company"" who, interestingly enough, in 2020 announced the appointment of ""Jeffrey B. Kindler, former chairman and CEO of Pfizer, as [a] senior adviser.""
Now I don't know the answer to this, but did Neil Young independently make the decision to try and blackball Joe Rogan for questioning big pharma and the government narrative? Or was it a team decision with a multi-billion-dollar investment firm who also owns a big chunk of his music?
The first point to note here is that, even among those promulgating the Young-Pfizer theory, it is not seriously suggested that Pfizer itself -- which is, after all, a pharmaceutical company -- owns the rights to any of Young's music. That claim can be dismissed. 
Before assessing the logic behind the theory, and its coherence, it's worth briefly evaluating the accuracy of each of its components. First, it appears to be true that, in January 2021, Young sold half of his songs to Hipgnosis. In a news release, Hipgnosis wrote: ""...The Company has acquired 50% of Neil Young's worldwide copyright and income interests in his entire song catalogue comprising 1,180 songs.""
Secondly, it is also true that in October 2021, Blackstone bought an ownership stake in Hipgnosis, as demonstrated in news releases published by both companies. Finally, it is also true that in August 2020, Blackstone hired Jeff Kindler as a senior advisor, and that Kindler used to be the chairman and CEO of Pfizer. 
However, rather than having uncovered a web of corruption, those pushing the Young-Pfizer story were engaging in the classic conspiracy theorist's fallacy of finding whatever possible connection they can between two separate entities (in this case, Young and Pfizer) without first testing the logical or chronological basis of that putative link. In other words, ""connecting the dots"" by whatever means available, rather than uncovering an actual, organic conspiracy. 
Let's look at the sequence of events. Kindler left Pfizer in 2010 -- a full decade before he joined Blackstone, and before the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted Pfizer to develop a vaccine along with its German partner BioNTech.
Blackstone is a publicly traded company, meaning it has a fiduciary duty to its shareholders, and Kindler, in turn, has a professional obligation to provide sound business and strategic advice to Blackstone. Aside from presenting no concrete evidence whatsoever, those pushing the Young-Pfizer conspiracy theory appear to be asking readers to believe, despite these circumstances, one of two explanations:

That Kindler set aside his obligations to Blackstone and managed to persuade the company to engage in a billion-dollar investment venture with Hipgnosis, specifically so that they could acquire some influence over the licensing of Young's music and then leverage that against Rogan's vaccine skepticism on Spotify, for the benefit of Pfizer, a completely separate company, which Kindler had left a decade earlier; or
That access to half of Young's catalog was a ""happy accident"" of the Blackstone-Hipgnosis deal but that, with the connivance of Young himself, Kindler sought to leverage that access against Rogan and Spotify, all for the benefit of Pfizer, a completely separate company, which Kindler had left a decade earlier. 

As outlandish as these scenarios are, they are premised on even shakier assumptions: for example, that Kindler was even consulted on the Blackstone-Hipgnosis deal; or that if he was, he was in favor of it; and that Young has any remaining financial or commercial obligations to Hipgnosis and/or Blackstone after the sale of half his music -- after all, if that deal is already done, what is the supposed basis of Hipgnosis or Blackstone's putative leverage over Young?
It's not necessary to list, in excruciating detail, each of the known factual and logical flaws associated with the Young-Pfizer conspiracy theory. The claim that the pharmaceutical company ""owned Young's music catalog"" was patently false, and the theory of a fantastical web of corruption, with Kindler at its centre, was presented without any concrete evidence and, perhaps more importantly, made no sense whatsoever.

19.WasHalynaHutchinsNex,"
The death of Halyna Hutchins, the director of photography who was fatally shot on the set of the movie ""Rust"" when a prop gun misfired, has been the source of a number of conspiratorial and false rumors. Doctored images designed to look like news article falsely claimed that actor Alec Baldwin was ranting about former President Donald Trump when the gun fired, and a fake tweet circulated supposedly showing a message from Hutchins about Hillary Clinton. 
On October 24, 2021, a fake news article was published claiming that Hutchins was scheduled to make a documentary about Hollywood pedophile rings:

This article was published by the website WorldGreyNews.com. This is not a genuine news website. Rather, this is a ""fake news generator"" that allows users to make up their own headlines, write their own fake news items, and then publish them alongside the logos of genuine news organizations.
Here's a screenshot of WGN's ""fake news creator"" page: 







While there is no truth to this story, and while it originated with a fake news generator, it still picked up traction on social media where it was presented as a factual news item:

This false rumor about Hutchins is part of a larger conspiracy theory holding that there is a vast pedophile ring that involves major Hollywood players like Tom Hanks (as well as companies, the mainstream media, liberal politicians, random bystanders, and just about anyone who has voiced opposition to former U.S. President Donald Trump). This conspiracy theory has led to dozens of pieces of disinformation.
For example, contrary to what has been claimed, Hillary Clinton was not convicted of child sex trafficking, late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg did not say pedophilia was good for children, Disney did not acquire Pornhub, and Wayfair is not trafficking children in overpriced cabinets.

117.DepartmentofHomelandSecuritydeemedasterrorismbehaviorthatincludesresistingCOVIDregulationsandthinkingtheelectionwasriggedInotherwordsifyouareaTrumpsupporteryouareaterrorist,"
Some social media users are claiming that the Department of Homeland Security has labeled them terrorists for opposing COVID-19 restrictions and believing that Donald Trump won the 2020 election. 
""Behavior the White House and DHS deemed as terrorism today!"" an image on Instagram. ""Resisting COVID regulations, opposing government, spreading 'misinformation,' thinking the election was rigged."" 
""In other words if you are Trump supporter you are a terrorist!"" reads the caption. 
National security experts told PolitiFact that the claim is misleading. 
""The conspiracy theory has no validity,"" said Jason Blazakis, former director of the Counterterrorism Finance and Designations Office at the State Department. 
Claim stems from misreading of NTAS bulletin
This claim appears to refer to a National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin released Aug. 13 by Alejandro Mayorkas, the secretary for homeland security. 
The system was established in 2011 to replace a similar system created in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. The system releases two types of warnings to the American public: alerts and bulletins. Alerts, which are issued when DHS has ""specific, credible"" information about a terror threat, are the more serious and urgent of the two. Bulletins communicate ""general trends"" that could potentially escalate into threats of terrorism. 
The Aug. 13 bulletin warned of a ""current heightened threat environment across the United States,"" citing the 20th anniversary of 9/11 and other forces, including threats posed by ""domestic terrorists, individuals and groups engaged in grievance-based violence, and those inspired or motivated by foreign terrorists and other malign foreign influences."" It continued:
""These actors are increasingly exploiting online forums to influence and spread violent extremist narratives and promote violent activity. Such threats are also exacerbated by impacts of the ongoing global pandemic, including grievances over public health safety measures and perceived government restrictions."" 
It said that violent extremists who are ""racially- or ethnically-motivated"" or ""anti-government/anti-authority"" remain a national threat priority, and warned they ""may seek to exploit the potential re-establishment of public health restrictions as a rationale to conduct attacks.""

It also warned that ""domestic violent extremists"" have been introducing and amplifying online narratives that promote violence, including ""continued, non-specific calls for violence on multiple online platforms"" associated with such ""ideologies or conspiracy theories on perceived election fraud and alleged reinstatement, and responses to anticipated restrictions relating to the increasing COVID cases.""
Nowhere does the advisory bulletin label all Trump supporters or conspiracy theorists terrorists. Nor did the bulletin add specific groups or individuals to existing lists of terror organizations. And it does not say that ""resisting COVID regulations"" and ""thinking the election was rigged"" amounts to terrorism. 
The bulletin ""doesn't designate any individuals or groups as domestic terror organizations,"" said Faiza Patel, director of the Brennan Center's Liberty & National Security Program. ""It is similar to statements by the director of national intelligence and the FBI that identify domestic terrorism as the principal threat facing the U.S. at this time and uses the same terminology.""
The legal authority to officially designate groups as terrorists belongs to the U.S. departments of State and Treasury, not to the National Terrorism Advisory System. And that authority doesn't allow for American citizens to be designated as terrorists unless they are linked to a designated terrorist group based overseas, said Blazakis. 
""There is no legal mechanism that exists to designate individuals who may be connected to groups like the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, Three Percenters and the like,"" he said. 
Our ruling 
An Instagram post claimed that DHS ""deemed as terrorism"" behavior that includes ""resisting  COVID regulations"" and ""thinking the election was rigged."" In summary, the caption to the post read, ""if you are a Trump supporter, you are a terrorist.""
A National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin cited anger over COVID-19 restrictions and online threats to government officials as points of political tension that could escalate into violence. 
The advisory bulletin doesn't label all Trump supporters or conspiracy theorists terrorists. Nor does the bulletin add any specific groups or individuals to existing lists of terror organizations. And it does not equate disagreeing with COVID-19 regulations"" or ""thinking the election was rigged"" with terrorism.
The National Terrorism Advisory System doesn't have the legal authority to designate new groups or individuals as terrorists.

This week: COVID on a plane ... Pelosi wrongly blames GOP for Illinois budget problems ... Obama not first to criticize his successor ... Is an HPV vaccine more deadly than COVID? Nope ... Michael Flynn's reversal of fortune ... No, the Supreme Court didn't say stay-at-home orders are illegal
What's the risk of getting COVID-19 from air travel? 
During an appearance on the Sunday news show ""Face the Nation,"" Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly said it was safe for Americans to fly during the coronavirus epidemic.
""I don't think the risk on an airplane is any greater risk than anywhere else, and in fact, you just look at the layered approach that we use. It's as safe as an environment as you're going to find,"" said Kelly. 
Is it as safe as any other environment? We rated his claim Mostly False. 
All in all, Kelly has some valid points about the safety of airplanes right now. But he also overplayed his hand.
Our key findings: 
* Airplanes have highly effective ventilation systems. That makes them safer than other enclosed modes of transportation, like subways or buses.
* But studies show that infectious disease transmission can occur on airplanes, particularly if you are seated next to someone who is carrying an illness.
* It's difficult to maintain social distancing on an airplane -- think of someone walking by on the way to the bathroom -- especially compared with being at home.

Fact-checks of the week
Nancy Pelosi wrong on Illinois budget troubles: The Democratic speaker of the House said that Illinois ""got into fiscal problems because of a Republican governor who was governor there"" before current Gov. J.B. Pritzker. That rates Mostly False. Illinois' financial situation did worsen during Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner's term. The state operated without a spending plan for an unprecedented two years, but he wasn't solely to blame. What's more, the state was already teetering on the brink when he took office because of decisions made by leaders from both parties dating back decades.
Obama not the only former president with something to say: Former President Barack Obama called the Trump administration's response to COVID-19 ""an absolute chaotic disaster."" That aggravated current President Donald Trump, so Trump retweeted a message saying Obama is the first ex-president to speak ill of his successor. That claim rates False. From Hoover to Truman, Ford to Carter and beyond, ex-presidents have criticized the person who followed them into office. Read our brief history of the presidential predecessor dis. 
What's more dangerous: COVID-19 or HPV vaccine? Iowa state Rep. Jeff Shipley had this warning on Twitter for young people: ""Someone should tell them they have a greater chance of being killed by the HPV vaccine than COVID-19."" That claim rates Pants on Fire. Shipley admitted he made it up. Numbers show no deaths in Iowa from the HPV vaccine, while COVID-19 deaths among young people are well-documented. 
What's going on with Michael Flynn? 
After a three-year-plus legal saga involving Russia and the 2016 election, the Justice Department said it was recommending that the judge dismiss the case against former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. 
The filing said that a key interview of Flynn did not have ""a legitimate investigative basis"" and therefore the department does not consider Flynn's statements from the interview to be ""material even if untrue."" 
Flynn had held conversations with senior Russian officials about lifting sanctions on Russia, then he denied to federal law enforcement that those conversations had taken place. 
Trump praised the developments in the Flynn case, telling reporters in the Oval Office that Flynn ""was an innocent man. He is a great gentleman.""
But the Justice Department's decision to reverse course on a prosecution that had already produced a guilty plea stunned legal experts.
""It is very unusual to dismiss a case after a defendant has pled guilty,"" said Mark Osler, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas. ""I can only imagine that being justified if there is evidence that the guilty plea was coerced or the defense attorney failed in some epic way to properly inform their client, and neither of those things are at issue here. The elements of the crime were proven and agreed to by a defendant with good lawyers and no signs of coercion.""
Our story summarized other opinions from legal experts, who said the move by Trump's Justice Department was highly unusual and seemed politically motivated.
It will now be up to the judge, Emmet Sullivan, to decide whether to grant the government's request that the case be dismissed in a way that it cannot be revived in the future. On May 12, Sullivan said he intended to consider third-party opinions on the case before making a decision.

60.BradParscalesSuicide,"



Quick Take
Social media accounts that boost conspiracy theories make a baseless claim that the Clintons were involved in a recent incident at the home of Brad Parscale, President Donald Trump's former campaign manager. The police report describes a domestic dispute during which Parscale threatened suicide.
Full Story
Brad Parscale, who runs the digital strategy for President Donald Trump's reelection campaign, was hospitalized under a Florida mental health law after threatening suicide Sept. 27.
Within hours, an Instagram account that promotes the QAnon conspiracy theory had posted a picture of Parscale with text that said: ""My name is Brad Parscale. 24 hours ago I said I would expose the Clinton families connections to Haiti.""
The same account had posted other memes over the last two months referring to the child trafficking and cannibalism claims that are part of the QAnon conspiracy theory, which is based on the idea that there is an elite group of leaders who secretly run the government. Another account posted the Parscale claim with this comment: ""Tonight's he's in a Florida hospital on suicide watch!  #neverevealyourplans #clintoncided.""
The term ""clintoncided"" refers to the long-running conspiracy theory that Bill and Hillary Clinton are responsible for the deaths of their political adversaries. We've written about similar claims before.
But there's no evidence that the Clintons were involved in Parscale's recent incident.
The police report describes a domestic dispute between Parscale and his wife, Candice Parscale, during which he had brandished a loaded gun and she fled their home.
Candice Parscale told police that her husband, who was replaced as Trump's campaign manager in July, had been ""depressed and suicidal recently,"" according to the police report. ""This has led him to consume alcohol a lot more frequently and make suicidal statements,"" it said.
During the couple's argument on Sept. 27, Brad Parscale ""took possession of one of his firearms, racked the slide, loading it right in his wife`s presence,"" according to the report. Candice Parscale left the house and thought she heard a gunshot. A realtor who was showing a house down the street from the Parscale's home called police on her behalf.
When Fort Lauderdale police arrived, they ""noticed several large sized contusions on both of [Candice Parscale's] arms, her cheek and forehead,"" according to the report, which also said that Candice Parscale ""stated Brad Parscale hits her.""
The only two people noted in the report as being in the house at the time were Brad and Candice Parscale. There is no mention of the Clintons or anyone else.
After Brad Parscale was convinced to come out of the house, a SWAT team apprehended him. Officers then collected 10 guns from the house and brought him to a local hospital under the Baker Act, a Florida law that allows for the involuntary evaluation of those with mental illnesses.

053.LawsuitClaimsFoxNews,"
On 1 August 2017, a Fox News contributor filed a federal lawsuit that accuses Fox News of ""contriving"" with President Donald Trump and members of his administration ""to publish and disseminate fake news to affect politics in America"" with the intention of distracting the public from alleged collusion between Russia and members of Trump's campaign.
In the suit, Fox News contributor and former Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police officer Rod Wheeler claims that key quotes attributed to him in the 16 May 2017 Fox News story, which was written by reporter Malia Zimmerman, were fabricated.
Wheeler was quoted making statements indicating that he had information that slain Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was the one who had leaked DNC e-mails to document dumping site WikiLeaks during the 2016 election, rather than Russian hackers.
The quotes disavowed as fake by Wheeler are as follows:
My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and Wikileaks.
[...]
My investigation shows someone within the D.C. government, Democratic National Committee or Clinton team is blocking the murder investigation from going forward. That is unfortunate. Seth Rich's murder is unsolved as a result of that. 






Fox News retracted the story on 23 May 2017, saying it that did not meet their editorial standards. Wheeler claims that Ed Butowsky (a Fox contributor who is also a wealthy investor and Trump supporter) and Zimmerman went so far as to collude with the highest level of the United States government to create the false story, with the intention of lifting the cloud of suspicion that Trump associates had themselves colluded with the Russian government to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. One week earlier, the lawsuit notes, Trump had fired FBI director James Comey after meeting with him privately and complaining about the investigation.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages for defamation, and also accuses the conservative cable channel of discriminating against Wheeler because he is African-American.
Fox News president Jay Wallace released a statement denying the allegations:
The accusation that FoxNews.com published Malia Zimmerman's story to help detract from coverage of the Russia collusion issue is completely erroneous. The retraction of this story is still being investigated internally and we have no evidence that Rod Wheeler was misquoted by Zimmerman. Additionally, FOX News vehemently denies the race discrimination claims in the lawsuit -- the dispute between Zimmerman and Rod Wheeler has nothing to do with race.
The suit says the article was given the green light personally by President Trump, and that it was discussed with top members of his administration, including former press secretary Sean Spicer, chief strategist Steve Bannon, and Department of Justice spokeswoman Sarah Flores.
A text message allegedly sent from Butowsky to Wheeler on 14 May 2017 reads:
Not to add any more pressure but the president [Donald Trump] just read the article. He wants the article out immediately. It's now all up to you. But don't feel the pressure
According to court documents, Wheeler is a ""private investigation consultant"" and crime analyst. Butowsky initially approached him with a 23 February 2017 text message, asking him to conduct an investigation into the Rich murder and offering to foot the bill. Butowsky told Wheeler he was working with Zimmerman, an ""investigative journalist"" at the cable outlet. The lawsuit alleges that Butowsky and Zimmerman were not charitably seeking the truth on behalf of the murdered man's family, but instead banking on Wheeler confirming their storyline that Rich had leaked the e-mails and was murdered by DNC operatives in a cover-up scheme. 






According to court documents, Butowsky texted multiple messages to Wheeler's phone telling him how he should frame the story. Part of one message read:
[t]he narrative in the interviews you might use is that your and Malia's work prove that the Russians didn't hack into the DNC and steal the emails and impact our election
Shortly after the story broke, Wheeler began retracting comments made on WTTG, a Washington D.C. Fox affiliate, that seemed to support the cable news channels's story. (Wheeler told BuzzFeed that he had been misquoted by WTTG; although he appeared to have told the station he saw evidence of e-mails on Rich's laptop computer, he said he was only talking about reporting by Zimmerman.) The Rich family slammed Wheeler and Fox News and sent Wheeler a cease and desist letter, saying he had violated their agreement which barred him from speaking about the case in the media.
Nevertheless, in the week between the Fox story being published and retracted, it traveled far and wide across the Internet. It was promoted on Twitter by the Russian embassy in the United Kingdom, as well as Kremlin-funded outlets like RT and Sputnik. It was also pushed by dubious hacker figures like Kim Dotcom, and conspiracy sites like Zero Hedge and InfoWars as well as ""alt-right"" sites like Breitbart. It even got a boost from WikiLeaks in that timeframe, along with high profile Fox News pundit Sean Hannity, and Trump surrogate Newt Gingrich.
The Rich family released a brief statement about the lawsuit, saying:
While we can't speak to the evidence that you now have, we are hopeful that this brings an end to what has been the most emotionally difficult time in our lives and an end to conspiracy theories surrounding our beloved Seth. 
Rich, 27, was shot and killed at 4:20 A.M. on 10 July 2016, not far from his Washington, D.C. apartment. Police believe the murder was an attempted robbery, and have not made any arrests as of 1 August 2017.
The lawsuit comes as Fox News's parent company, 21st Century Fox, attempts to take over Sky News in the United Kingdom -- an effort that has been stymied by British regulator Ofcom, which has concerns that such a merger would allow chief executive Rupert Murdoch and his sons to have too much media influence. In a statement, Wheeler's attorney, Douglas Wigdor, raised questions about the fitness of Fox to merge with Sky in relation to the allegations made in the lawsuit:
According to the complaint, at the same time that 21st Century Fox's General Counsel, Gerson Zweifach, was meeting with the UK regulators in an attempt to convince them that Fox had in place procedures to ensure compliance with broadcasting standards to purchase Sky, Fox News was working with the Trump administration to disseminate fake news in order to distract the public from Russia's alleged attempts to influence our Country's presidential election.
Washington, D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department told us that the Rich murder remains under investigation. Our messages sent to Zimmerman, Butowsky and the White House for comment have not been answered. During a press briefing, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president had ""no knowledge"" of the story and the White House was not involved in it.

Despite social media platforms' efforts to remove it, millions of people have seen a viral video of doctors making false and misleading claims about the coronavirus pandemic.
Breitbart, a conservative news outlet, published the 40-plus-minute-long video on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube on July 27. It's a live stream of a Washington, D.C., press conference organized by the Tea Party Patriots, a conservative group backed by Republican donors. Rep. Ralph Norman. R-S.C., attended the event.
The video went viral after it was widely shared in Facebook groups for anti-vaxxers and people against face masks. Other groups dedicated to conspiracy theories like QAnon further amplified the video. Eventually, public figures like President Donald Trump and Madonna shared it with millions of social media followers.
RELATED: Fact-checking a video of doctors talking about coronavirus, hydroxychloroquine
""There was a group of doctors yesterday, a large group that were put on the internet. For some reason, the internet wanted to take them down and took them off,"" Trump said during a July 28 press conference. ""I don't know why. I think they're very respected doctors.""
Social media platforms removed the video because it contains several claims that run counter to official recommendations from public health officials. But who are the doctors who made them? PolitiFact investigated.
The physicians in the video are associated with a group called America's Frontline Doctors, which advocates against official narratives of the coronavirus pandemic. The group, whose now-defunct website was registered on July 16, was in Washington for a ""White Coat Summit,"" after which some of the doctors met with Vice President Mike Pence.
All of the physicians we fact-checked have a history of making unproven, conspiratorial or bizarre medical claims. 

(Screenshot from Facebook)
Dr. Stella Immanuel
Dr. Stella Immanuel is a Houston-based primary care physician and minister. In the video, she claimed that the coronavirus ""has a cure.""
""It is called hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and Zithromax,"" Immanuel said. ""I know you people want to talk about a mask. Hello? You don't need a mask. There is a cure.""
We rated that False -- and Immanuel has a track record of making unproven medical claims, such as believing in alien DNA.
Immanuel has a Texas medical license with specialties in pediatrics and emergency medicine. She says she has been practicing medicine in the United States or Canada for 24 years. She received her medical degree in Nigeria.
Immanuel operates a clinic in a strip mall next to her church, Firepower Ministries. In sermons published on YouTube and articles on the church's now-defunct website, first unearthed by the Daily Beast, Immanuel makes several outlandish medical claims.
Among them: Medical problems like cysts are caused by sex with ""spirit husbands"" and ""spirit wives,"" DNA from aliens is being used in medicine and scientists are developing vaccines to prevent people from being religious.
More recently, Immanuel has doubled down on hydroxychloroquine, which is not a proven treatment (or cure) for COVID-19.
""If you have taken hydroxychloroquine and you have been cured, it's time to speak up,"" she said in a July 28 Facebook video.
We reached out to Immanuel for a comment, but we haven't heard back.

(Screenshot from Facebook)
Dr. Dan Erickson
Dr. Dan Erickson is a California-based osteopath who co-owns an urgent care clinic. In the video, he claimed that state lockdowns have little effect on the coronavirus fatality rate.
""So this measured approach I'm talking about isn't made up. It's going on in Sweden, and their deaths are about 564 per million. UK, full lockdown, 600 deaths per million,"" he said. ""So we're seeing that the lockdowns aren't decreasing significantly the number of deaths per million.""
We found that those numbers are in the ballpark, but they're cherry-picked. And Erickson has a history of making misleading and unproven claims about the coronavirus.
Erickson co-owns an urgent care clinic in the Bakersfield, Calif., area. He is a former emergency room physician and has a medical license through the Osteopathic Medical Board of California.
In May, Erickson appeared with Dr. Artin Massihi, co-owner of Accelerated Urgent Care, in another viral video called ""Plandemic,"" which is filled with conspiracy theories about the coronavirus pandemic. In it, they claimed that stay-at-home orders and face masks are not necessary because they weaken your immune system. The doctors made similar assertions in an April press conference and on Fox News.
In a joint statement, the American College of Emergency Physicians and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine condemned Erickson and Massihi's claims, saying that they ""strongly advise against using any statements of Drs. Erickson and Massihi as a basis for policy and decision making.""
We reached you to Accelerated Urgent Care for a comment, but we haven't heard back.

(Screenshot from Facebook)
Dr. Simone Gold
Dr. Simone Gold is the founder of America's Frontline Doctors and a Los Angeles-based physician. In the video, she made misleading claims about hydroxychloroquine prescriptions and coronavirus case numbers.
""We're here because we feel as though the American people have not heard from all of the expertise that's out there all across our country,"" Gold said at the start of the press conference.
According to the Medical Board of California, Gold holds an active medical license. She specializes in emergency medicine and general practice. She graduated from Rosalind Franklin University's Chicago Medical School in 1989.
For the past few months, Gold has been involved in a drive aimed at mobilizing doctors that believe states should reopen faster. The Save Our Country Coalition, which seeks to raise millions of dollars, is backed by advocates linked to several conservative organizations, including the FreedomWorks Foundation and the Tea Party Patriots, according to the Guardian.
As part of that effort, hundreds of physicians sent an open letter to Trump in late May that called state shutdowns ""a mass casualty incident"" -- despite evidence that suggests stay-at-home orders prevented new coronavirus cases and deaths. Gold was the first signature on the letter.
Gold has also appeared on conservative talk radio and podcast programs, during which she has advocated for the use of hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19 patients. She has donated to several Republican causes in the past, including Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.
Gold told the Associated Press that she started to speak out about the pandemic because there is ""no scientific basis that the average American should be concerned"" about COVID-19. (Public health experts say otherwise.)
We reached out to Gold for a comment, but we haven't heard back.

Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.
On Nov. 14, 2020, the website Buffalo Chronicle published an article claiming that President-elect Joe Biden's campaign paid a Philadelphia mob boss named ""Skinny Joey"" Merlino to rig the 2020 election:

There is no evidence to support the claims in this article. Merlino is a real person, but the claim that the Biden campaign paid him to forge ballots is false.
For starters, there simply is no evidence to support claims of widespread voter fraud (mob related or not) in the 2020 election. Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said: ""Certainly if there was some, we would be on it immediately or our law enforcement partners would be on it immediately ... I've seen a lot of tweets about it, I've seen a lot of public statements about it, but we've seen absolutely no evidence of it."" 






The idea that 300,000 fraudulent ballots could simply be added to the vote total is also dubious. There are a number of security measures that would make such a scheme virtually impossible to accomplish. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) addressed similar rumors of this nature on their rumor control page, writing:
Reality: Robust safeguards including canvassing and auditing procedures help ensure the accuracy of official election results.
Rumor: A bad actor could change election results without detection.
Get the Facts: The systems and processes used by election officials to tabulate votes and certify official results are protected by various safeguards that help ensure the accuracy of election results. These safeguards include measures that help ensure tabulation systems function as intended, protect against malicious software, and enable the identification and correction of any irregularities.
In a joint statement from CISA and other election security officials across the country, the 2020 election was dubbed ""the most secure in American history.""
As for the claims specific to ""Skinny Joey"" Merlino made by the Buffalo Chronicle, one should first consider the source. This website has a history of publishing dubious information. The site has spread unfounded rumors about a ban on cigarettes in New York, false claims about Sen. Elizabeth Warren paying someone for sex, and unsubstantiated stories about a sex scandal involving Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
The Buffalo Chronicle provided no evidence to support its claims. Rather, this story is based on quotes from anonymous sources. 
In addition to the outlandish nature of these claims, statements from officials saying that there has been no evidence of voter fraud, and the Buffalo Chronicle's history of spreading conspiracy theories, Merlino himself has also disputed these allegations. A lawyer for Merlino, who is on supervised release in Florida following a plea deal on a 2018 racketeering charge, denied that his client was involved in any sort of fraud in Pennsylvania. 
Merlino's lawyer John Meringolo took special offense at the accusation that the reputed mobster was getting ready to snitch, saying: ""My client categorically denies all the allegations and Joey would rather die than ever be a snitch.""

014.DidaMandalayBayHotel,"
Among the many conspiracy theories surrounding the October 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada is one that involves Chad Nishimura, a Mandalay Bay Hotel valet worker who said he parked suspected shooter Stephen Paddock's car on his arrival at the hotel. 
According to conspiracy theorists, Nishimura told a reporter in his native Hawaii that Paddock did not appear to have many bags with him, thus contradicting the ""official"" narrative that Paddock acted alone, and prompting Nishimura's sinister disappearance.  On 10 October 2017, the disreputable and rarely accurate web site Neon Nettle wrote: 
A valet worker from the Mandalay Bay hotel, who parked the suspected Las Vegas shooting gunman's car, has mysteriously vanished after giving an interview saying Stephen Paddock was a ""normal guy"" who ""didn't have many bags.""
There is no evidence that Nishimura has disappeared or been reported missing, and this account contains several important factual errors and logical mistakes, typical of much of the content that Neon Nettle and other sites of its ilk publish.
It is true that Nishimura spoke to KITV 4, a Honolulu ABC affiliate, for an article published on 3 October 2017 that has since been deleted:
A Kamehameha graduate working as a valet at the Mandalay Bay Resort said he parked the shooter's car on Saturday. The gunman, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, checked his car into the hotel on Saturday morning. Valet Chad Nishimura, who is from Mililani, said he spoke briefly with Paddock.
 
""Just in shock, really. It's scary to know that I was close to someone that was that dangerous. I would've never thought. He seemed like a normal guy. When he came in, nothing too weird about him. He didn't have any crazy bags with him that I can remember. We are a convention hotel so we have a bunch of people that have boxes and multiple carts worth of stuff. There's nothing weird that I can remember,"" Nishimura said. 






(An archived version of the story can be viewed here.)
The first thing to note here is that Nishimura did not say Stephen Paddock didn't have many bags. He said Paddock didn't have any ""crazy bags"" and brought ""nothing weird"" that he could could remember. Further, it requires a logical leap to propose that if Stephen Paddock didn't have much luggage with him upon arriving at the Mandalay Bay Hotel, it follows that he must have had an accomplice in the 1 October 2017 mass shooting. Nothing in Nishimura's account of meeting Paddock eliminates the possibility that Paddock made multiple trips to the hotel, therefore making that particular conspiracy theory surrounding Nishimura fall down on this logical point alone. 
Neon Nettle also attributes the removal of the KITV 4 article to ""higher-ups at ABC taking issue with a report that conflicts with the narrative they are pushing on the public,"" and falsely states that the reporter Moanike'ala Nabarro had declined to answer readers who asked why the story had been deleted. 
In fact, Nabarro gave a clear answer to this question on 7 October 2017, three days before Neon Nettle published its story, saying that the decision was made in order to protect Nishimura's privacy:

Mililani native says he spoke to shooter before checking his car into the valet at Mandalay Bay- https://t.co/GjkRE9HRVk
-- Moanike'ala Nabarro (@moanikitv) October 3, 2017

Finally, there is no evidence that Chad Nishimura has ""vanished"" -- mysteriously or otherwise -- and in fact, there is evidence to contradict this claim. 
According to Neon Nettle, Nishimura ""has completely vanished since the report was published, with all of his social media accounts being scrubbed from the internet."" 






This is completely and provably false. Nishimura has been active on Facebook after 3 October, the publication date of the KITV 4 article which -- at least according to the conspiracy theory being pushed here -- prompted his ""disappearance"". (His Facebook account remains active, but we are not linking to it in the interest of protecting Nishimura's privacy from readers provoked by the groundless conspiracy theory peddled and promulgated by Neon Nettle and others.)
On 5 October 2017, Nishimura wrote:
I'm okay everyone, I was at the concert the night before, thankfully cut my wristband off and didnt [sic] go on Sunday. However I did park the shooters [sic] car...Thats been the rough part for me. 

Furthermore, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department has not listed Nishimura as a missing person.
This conspiracy theory is illogical, not supported by any evidence, contradicted by other evidence, and is false. Neon Nettle has a history of publishing inaccurate conspiracy theories, hoaxes and other fabricated content.  The Chad Nishimura case joins a laundry list of conspiracy theories and hoaxes revolving around the October 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas.

15Today is the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11's successful landing on the moon - yet there are still those who would claim that the entire landing was a hoax. In 1999, Gallup reported that 6 percent of Americans did not believe U.S. astronauts ever landed on the moon, with another 5 percent (somehow) still unsure. One of the most common-sense responses to these theorists was spoken by Apollo 16 astronaut Charlie Duke, who, according to The Space Review, simply said: ""If we faked going to the Moon, why did we fake it nine times?""
Newsweek recently wrote about this conspiracy theory, highlighting the work of a Web site called www.clavius.org - which for 10 years has been dedicated to debunking claims of a moon landing hoax and proving that there is no ""giant leap"" of logic behind its supporting arguments. This whole episode serves as a reminder of our constant efforts at FactCheck.org to debunk claims that President Obama was not ""Born in the U.S.A.""

One theory we don't anticipate ever having to shoot down, however, involves a question Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin was once asked by British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen: whether he thought man would ever walk on the sun. Aldrin said no -- even if it was winter.

077.SethRichsParentsThan,"
On 20 May 2017, a Twitter user with the handle @RedPillDropper tweeted a month-old video, using it to bolster a claim that it showed the parents of murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich ""thanking the Internet"" for spreading a debunked rumor that Rich leaked tens of thousands of e-mails to the document-dumping web site WikiLeaks just before he was killed: 

The MEDIA is lying about Seth Rich saying #SethRich parents want this to stop. Here's a video from his parents THANKING the internet! pic.twitter.com/9w96tOhj37
-- Red Pill (@RedPillDropper) May 20, 2017

The tweet referred to a now-debunked Fox News story from mid-May 2017 involving Rod Wheeler, a Fox commentator who claims to be a private investigator and former D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) homicide detective.
Wheeler told the network that his inside sources at MPD and the FBI informed him Rich had ""44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments"" on his computer, and that he had been in contact with WikiLeaks. He added that his sources told him police and the feds were told to ""stand down"" from the murder investigation. The story was picked up and aggregated by multiple web sites, but it only took a few hours for it to fall apart. 






Wheeler later backtracked on his claims, saying the Fox story wasn't accurate. We have been unable to locate a private detective license under his name in Washington, D.C. or Maryland, where his company, Capitol Investigations, is based.
Rich's family did not ""thank the Internet"" for spreading the false story. On the contrary, they sent a cease and desist letter on 18 May 2017, threatening to sue Wheeler if he continued to make comments about the case to the media. The family also responded vehemently to the rumor through their spokesman Brad Bauman, saying the claims were false and that the stories were exacerbating their grief. 
The video supposedly showing Rich's parents ""thanking"" people was originally posted to the family's GoFundMe page and uploaded to YouTube on 24 April 2017 -- weeks before Wheeler made the claims. In the video, Rich's parents thank people who donated money to the family's campaign to keep the investigation active until the murder is solved:

Despite the fact that the video demonstrably does not show Rich's parents ""thanking the Internet"" for spreading bogus claims about their son, popular right-wing conspiracy site The Gateway Pundit on 21 May 2017 picked up the tweet and reported the false claim along with incorrect details about the murder, while alluding to another debunked (and outlandish) story -- that Rich was en route to meet with the FBI but was taken out by hit men acting on behalf of Clinton:
Now it is being reported that the parents of Seth Rich are on the Internet thanking everyone who is helping the family find the two individuals who killed Seth Rich. A video of Rich's parents was tweeted as follows:

The MEDIA is lying about Seth Rich saying #SethRich parents want this to stop. Here's a video from his parents THANKING the internet! pic.twitter.com/9w96tOhj37
-- Red Pill (@RedPillDropper) May 20, 2017

Now it looks like the Seth's parents want help in finding their son's killers.
On July 8, 2016, 27 year-old Democratic staffer Seth Conrad Rich was murdered in Washington DC. The killer or killers took nothing from their victim, leaving behind his wallet, watch and phone.
Shortly after the killing, Redditors and social media users were pursuing a ""lead"" saying that Rich was en route to the FBI the morning of his murder, apparently intending to speak to special agents about an ""ongoing court case"" possibly involving the Clinton family. 






Bauman, the family's spokesman, told us that he and Aaron Rich, Seth Rich's brother, had encouraged Rich's parents to make the video ""in order to thank folks who had given money to the GoFundMe effort.""
On the GoFundMe page, Aaron Rich noted that his brother's death has been convenient fodder for conspiracy theories:
His murder remains a mystery, and despite the hard work of the detectives at the Washington Metropolitan Police Department, we have still been unable to get the answers to the questions surrounding his death. Because of the lack of clear evidence in the case, Seth's job working for the Democratic National Committee and the caustic political environment we find ourselves in today, many people have used my brother's murder for their own agendas. Every few weeks another conspiracy theory surfaces, another promise of credible information and another lack of evidence to support the crazy claims being made.
Everyone from former Georgia representative Newt Gingrich to Fox News pundit Sean Hannity to the Russian government has promoted the baseless story even after it was debunked.

Rating









False


							About this rating
						











 






Fact Check
Shortly after former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was assassinated on July 8, 2022, he became the target of a hackneyed conspiracy-theory meme.  






The meme comprises fake screenshots or posts supposedly authored by high-profile people who have recently died. The gist of the conspiracy theory is that those people supposedly had incriminating information on Hillary or Bill Clinton, and, because of that, they were killed as part of a Clinton cover-up scheme.
In the days after Abe's death, this fake screenshot was shared on social media:

The text of the fake tweet read, ""I have information that will lead to the arrest of Hillary Clinton."" Several social media users questioned whether the post was real.
Screenshots supposedly showing tweets written by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Halyna Hutchins, a cinematographer killed by a prop gun misfire shot by actor Alec Baldwin, made the same claim -- verbatim -- after their deaths.Also, the Twitter handle shown in the image above (@ShinzoAbe) was not the handle for Abe's official Twitter account (@AbeShinzo).
Although the entire Clinton family is a favorite target of conspiracy theorists, Hillary Clinton became a prominent obsession among them when she launched a presidential campaign against Donald Trump in 2016, and after she lost that race.
Abe was assassinated while delivering a speech in the Japanese city of Nara. He served as Japan's prime minister from 2012 to 2020.

An image shared on social media in September 2020 purported to reveal that international trade data showed dozens of nations bought COVID-19 testing and diagnostic materials more than two years before the coronavirus pandemic was declared and SARS-CoV-2, the responsible virus, was first identified.

The above image was shared to Facebook and Twitter in the first week of September 2020. The screenshots came as conspiracy theories surrounding the origin and severity of the coronavirus proved particularly contagious in 2020. A number of far-fetched COVID-19 misinformation campaigns were shared extensively across the internet, from claims that erroneously argued that SARS-CoV-2 was a man-made bioweapon created in a lab to social media users who falsely pushed the idea that the disease was spread by 5G towers.
One user on Twitter posited, for example, that the reported data was ""more proof"" that the COVID-19 pandemic was ""planned and orchestrated."" The tweet went on to argue that dozens of countries preemptively ordered COVID-19 tests ""back in 2018 when [the virus] didn't exist."" 

More proof. If this wasn't planned and orchestrated, how on earth did they know to order covid-19 tests back in 2018 when it didn't exist?Who manufactured them and how long before did they know? https://t.co/PjKziQDm2n
-- Kimberley ?? (@kimberley82h) September 6, 2020

This claim is false, although it is based on a screen capture of real data published in the World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS), a software program provided by the World Bank that allows users access to an international trade database that tracks trade between countries. WITS is a joint initiative between the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, and several other leading intergovernmental organizations that tracks the import and export of various goods -- including medical supplies and equipment -- using the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, referred to simply as HS codes. 






Before the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, health-related products were tracked in the database under more technical terms as part of the sixth edition of the HS nomenclature first published in 2017 and employed by more than 200 countries in 2020. In April, the World Customs Organization (WCO) followed in the footsteps of the World Health Organization to create a list of HS codes that allowed countries to track the movement of ""critical products"" related to COVID-19. Each of the numerical codes referenced in the screenshots was in existence in 2017 and still in use in 2020, according to WCO Communications Officer Laure Tempier.
The June 2020 version of the code list included dozens of specific medical devices used to diagnose or treat COVID, such as ventilators and hand sanitizers, which existed and were tracked under WITS before the COVID-19 outbreak. For instance, items coded under 9027.80 are specific to a medical device called a colorimetric carbon dioxide detector that helps medical professionals determine if a patient is correctly connected to a ventilator. Under the revamped 2020 classification system, this item was considered a part of those categorized as ""COVID-19 Diagnostic Test instruments and apparatus.""
""The short answer is that these products have had other uses for many years but have become COVID-19 specific [in 2020],"" wrote Tempier in an email to Snopes. ""These products are medical devices that have long had many other uses but have assumed particular importance because of COVID-19, and have been classified by the WCO as COVID-19 products to facilitate better tracking."" 
In short, the screenshot in question is authentic but was misinterpreted or misrepresented by social media users to further conspiracy theories about the origin of the disease. In response to the viral images, the World Bank issued a statement noting that the goal of the April and June updates was to ""put information about key COVID-related medical supplies in one easy-to-find place."" 
""However, in light of misinterpretations that have occurred in recent days, the labeling in the WITS site has been updated to reflect the reality: COVID-19 tests did not exist before 2020,"" wrote the WHO, adding that an update provided in early September 2020 correctly labeled COVID-19 test kits as medical tests and had made similar clarifying adjustments in other places.
An archived version of the WITS website saved on Sept. 4 clearly included ""COVID-19"" in the product description column and continued to do so for the following two days. The change to ""medical"" was put into place on Sept. 7. At the time of writing, the main database retained all of the original descriptions and labels that existed before the 2020 outbreak. All that has changed is the way in which they are labeled to the public. Full definitions and descriptions of traded goods classified under the HS system can be found on the WITS website. 
A side-by-side comparison of the widely circulated screenshot (left) and one of the report as it appeared at the time of writing (right), which is archived here for reference, showed where the word ""medical"" had replaced ""COVID-19"" in the updated version.

In its new form, the WITS website included the following statement: ""The data here track previously existing medical devices that are now classified by the World Customs Organization as critical to tackling COVID-19."" 
Tempier added that the WCO classification system is not necessarily ""critical to tackling the pandemic."" Rather, it is a ""key tool to support countries in identifying and ensuring that goods, which are essential in the fight against the virus, were cleared through borders as swiftly as possible.""
On Feb. 11, 2020, the WHO officially named the severe respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 is an abbreviation for coronavirus disease 2019. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ""CO"" stands for corona, ""VI"" for ""virus"" and ""D"" for ""disease."" The ""19"" in the name refers to the year that SARS-CoV-2 was first observed in humans, noted WHO. The disease was previously referred to as 2019-nCoV, which stood for 2019 novel coronavirus.

PolitiFact awards the Lie of the Year to the most significant falsehood or exaggeration that worked to undermine an accurate narrative. The 2020 designation goes to downplay and denial about the coronavirus.
Here's a look back at the past 11 years of ""winners.""
2019: Donald Trump's claim that whistleblower got Ukraine call 'almost completely wrong'
President Donald Trump worked hard to discredit a whistleblower complaint about a July 2019 phone call he had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The whistleblower raised the concern that Trump's actions leading up to and on that phone call amount to interference in the 2020 presidential election. Trump smeared the whistleblower as ""partisan"" and insisted more than 80 times that the whistleblower's account was incorrect, ""total fiction"" and ""almost completely wrong.""
Despite Trump's claims, the whistleblower got the call ""almost completely"" right. The whistleblower's account was validated by the very record of the call as released by the White House, plus testimony under oath from career diplomats and other officials. Also, Trump and his allies told reporters that Trump urged Zelensky to investigate political rival Joe Biden -- that's the point raised in the whistleblower's complaint.
2018: Online smear machine tries to take down Parkland students
After 17 people were viciously gunned down at a Florida high school, lies about the students started when they advocated for action against gun violence. Students were called ""crisis actors"" and worse. During a time of little bipartisanship, the attacks on the Parkland students set off a shared outrage in nearly all political corners.
2017: Russian election interference is a 'made-up story'
Trump continually asserted that Russia's meddling in the 2016 election was fake news, a hoax or a made-up story, even though there is widespread, bipartisan evidence to the contrary. In both classified and public reports, U.S. intelligence agencies said Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered actions to interfere with the election.
2016: Fake news
Conspiracy theories and hoaxes have always been part of America's political conversation, but in 2016 they took off online. Fake news found a willing enabler in then- candidate Trump, who at times repeated and legitimized made-up reports. We defined fake news as fabricated information, manipulated to look like credible news reports, then easily spread online.
2015: The campaign misstatements of Donald Trump
From ""thousands and thousands"" cheering in New Jersey on Sept. 11 to dubious accounts of his own record and words, Trump's 2015 inaccurate statements exhibited range, boldness and a disregard for the truth. By December 2015, we had rated 76% of Trump's claims Mostly False, False or Pants on Fire. No other politician had clocked more falsehoods on our Truth-O-Meter, and our only real contenders for Lie of the Year were Trump's. We rolled all them into one big trophy in 2015.
2014: Exaggerations about Ebola
In 2014, there were just two Ebola-related deaths in the United States, yet fear of the disease stretched nationwide, stoked by exaggerated claims from politicians and pundits. They said, wrongly, that Ebola was easy to catch, that immigrants illegally in the country may be carrying the virus, and that it was all part of a government or corporate conspiracy.
The false claims distorted the debate about a serious public health issue and edged the nation toward panic. In all, PolitiFact and PunditFact rated 16 separate Ebola claims as Mostly False, False or Pants on Fire, so we chose this collection as our 2014 Lie of the Year.
2013: 'If you like your health care plan, you can keep it'
President Barack Obama and other Democrats made this claim when marketing the Affordable Care Act. But in the fall of 2013, people started to receive insurance cancellation notices, definitively proving the statement wrong.
Boiling down the complicated health care law to a soundbite proved treacherous. Obama and his team made matters worse, suggesting the claim had been misunderstood all along. The political uproar led to a rare presidential apology.
2012: Mitt Romney campaign's ad on Jeeps made in China
During the 2012 presidential campaign, Mitt Romney's campaign unleashed an ad suggesting that Jeep was pulling its plants out of Ohio, a critical swing state, and moving production to China. But the Ohio Jeep plants weren't going anywhere; the moves in China were to expand into the Chinese auto market.
A flood of negative press coverage rained down on the Romney campaign, and he failed to turn the tide in Ohio, a key battleground state.
2011: 'Republicans voted to end Medicare'
After two years of being pounded by Republicans with false charges about the 2010 health care law, Democrats turned the tables. They slammed Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives for voting for a cost-cutting budget resolution promoted by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis.
Democrats said voting for this resolution amounted to voting to end Medicare. But Ryan never proposed ending Medicare; instead he wanted to bring more private insurers into the program. Democrats later modified their talking point to say Republicans wanted to end Medicare ""as we know it.""
2010: 'A government takeover of health care'
As lawmakers finalized the Affordable Care Act, Republicans couldn't stop repeating their mantra that the law is a government takeover of health care. It's not.
""Government takeover"" connotes a European approach where the government owns the hospitals and the doctors are public employees. But the Affordable Care Act relies largely on the free market, and it does not nationalize the country's health system in any way.
2009: 'Death panels'
Sarah Palin was the first to say the Affordable Care Act included ""death panels"" -- PolitiFact's very first Lie of the Year. Government boards that would determine whether seniors and the disabled were worthy of care were wholly fictional. Yet about 30% of the public in 2009 believed they were part of the health care law.
This wasn't hard to fact-check. There were not -- and still aren't -- any such death panels in the law.

86.FacebookTwitterFloun,"
CHICAGO (AP) -- Facebook and Twitter promised to stop encouraging the growth of the baseless conspiracy theory QAnon, which fashions President Donald Trump as a secret warrior against a supposed child-trafficking ring run by celebrities and government officials, after it reached an audience of millions on their platforms this year.
But the social media companies still aren't enforcing even the limited restrictions they've recently put in place to stem the tide of dangerous QAnon material, a review by The Associated Press found. Both platforms have vowed to stop ""suggesting"" QAnon material to users, a powerful way of introducing QAnon to new people.
But neither has actually succeeded at that.
On Wednesday, hours after a chaotic debate between Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, a video from a QAnon account that falsely claimed Biden wore a wire to cheat during the event was trending on Twitter, for example.
Twitter is even still running ads against QAnon material, in effect profiting off the type of tweets that it has vowed to limit. In some cases Facebook is still automatically directing users to follow public and secret QAnon pages or groups, the AP found. 






""Their algorithm worked to radicalize people and really gave this conspiracy theory a megaphone with which to expand,"" Sophie Bjork-James, an anthropologist at Vanderbilt University who studies QAnon, said of social platforms. ""They are responsible for shutting down that megaphone. And time and time again they are proving unwilling.""
The QAnon phenomenon sprawls across a patchwork of secret Facebook groups, Twitter accounts and YouTube videos. QAnon has been linked to real-world violence such as criminal reports of kidnapping and dangerous claims that the coronavirus is a hoax. But the conspiracy theory has also seeped into mainstream politics. Several Republican running for Congress this year are QAnon-friendly.
Although restricted to the backwaters of the internet for years, QAnon posts reached millions of people via social media this year. Interactions -- primarily likes and comments -- with public Facebook and Instagram posts that included QAnon terms began climbing in March. By July, they received more attention than at any other point in the last year, according to an AP analysis of data from CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned tool that helps track material on the platforms.
That month, public posts on Facebook-owned Instagram featuring the #QAnon hashtag received an average of 1.27 million likes and comments every week, according to the analysis. Some of those posts included news stories about QAnon. But the majority of the most popular Instagram posts during July were expressing support for the conspiracy theory, President Donald Trump, or far-right conservative causes, the AP found.
One post that used the QAnon hashtag, which raked up nearly 20,000 likes, claimed that ""no one has died from coronavirus."" Another was a photo of a Donald Trump that called him ""One of God's Finest Warriors.""
Twitter didn't limit the conspiracy theory until July 21, when it announced it was kicking off 7,000 QAnon accounts and promised to stop promoting or recommending QAnon. Facebook introduced its new rules on Aug. 18, pledging to stop encouraging users to join QAnon groups, banning QAnon hashtags and kicking off thousands of QAnon groups that encouraged violence.
""Unfortunately, it was too late and not enough,"" Bjork-James said.
The AP also discovered more than a dozen popular QAnon accounts on Twitter that collectively maintain a following of nearly 1.5 million users, almost all of which were recommended to users who followed other QAnon accounts. 






And Twitter appears to be profiting from those QAnon accounts. Nearly all of the accounts the AP identified had ads showing in their feeds for big brand names that sell everything from beer to toilet paper. That doesn't mean the brands intentionally placed their ads in the feeds of the accounts, although it does suggest that Twitter isn't preventing the ads from appearing next to QAnon material.
Twitter suspended just one of the accounts -- which had more than 250,000 followers -- after the AP inquired about it.
Many of those Twitter profiles featured QAnon terminology or imagery. Others were more subtle. One of the accounts is named after John F. Kennedy Jr. and promotes QAnon beliefs, including a theory that Kennedy Jr. isn't dead and is staging a comeback to announce his support for Trump.
Twitter said it has not banned QAnon from its site entirely, but says it doesn't make QAnon tweets or accounts visible in searches or recommendations. Views of QAnon tweets has dropped by 50 percent since its new rules took hold in July. The company did not address questions about ads running on QAnon pages for the record.
Facebook, meanwhile, hasn't followed through on some of its promises and is still directing users to groups that promote it, the AP found.
As recently as Thursday, Facebook's algorithm still directed to and even invited users to join QAnon groups. One page called ""QAnon Updates,"" where 11,000 users swap conspiracy theory videos and links, remained at the top of the site's recommendations in one QAnon search. Facebook's algorithm suggested a handful of QAnon groups, including one with ""Trump 2Q2Q"" in its name and another that used the term ""cue"" to hide from the crackdown. And an automated Sept. 2 email from Facebook recommended one user join a Facebook group whose cover photo featured a modified U.S. seal that said: ""In QAnon We Trust.""
On Instagram, versions of the hashtag ""WWG1WGA,"" shorthand for the QAnon motto ""Where we Go One, We Go All,"" are still searchable and used hundreds of times daily.
In a statement, Facebook acknowledged that QAnon accounts have been skirting the platform's new policies and said in a statement that its efforts require ""ongoing vigilance.""
Facebook said it has been following the developments for QAnon followers, including a purported directive that they should drop references to ""Q"" or ""QAnon"" in order to avoid detection and bans by social media companies. But due to its sheer size and power, Facebook still appears to be the primary platform aiding QAnon's spread into the mainstream.
""Are they responsible in some part for QAnon's rise because they didn't see the lies and misinformation those people were purveying?"" asked David Kirkpatrick, author of the ""Facebook Effect."" ""They are the primary platform on which QAnon dialogue takes place. Because they are the primary platform for any dialogue.""

However, this video, taken from a livestream of the ballot counting facility, showed nothing untoward taking place. Rather, it was manipulated and presented without context to make it seem as if it captured something nefarious (and illegal) were occurring.
As The Philadelphia Inquirer reported, what the video depicted was a ballot counter transcribing damaged ballots so that they could be fed into the scanning machinery and recorded properly:
The [ballot] counter depicted in the video snippet was being observed by poll watchers from both political parties, according to county spokeswoman Adrienne Marofsky, who added that those watchers aren't shown in-frame because of the way the video has been manipulated.
In the video, the female ballot counter is transcribing ballots that had been damaged, and were unable to be fed into the counting machines, she said. A small number of the ballots the county received were in that condition, and had to have their information copied onto a blank ballot so the vote could be counted properly.
County officials, in a statement, said that the manufacturer of the machine scanning ballots, Hart, directs ballot counters to follow this procedure for damaged ballots.

It's difficult to summarize the wide-ranging, ever-expanding, and practically nonsensical QAnon conspiracy theory. For the purposes of this article, readers should know that one of the main tenets of QAnon revolves around the claim that liberals, Hollywood celebrities, and various world leaders are involved in global pedophilia ring (a la Pizzagate).
With this in mind, it's perhaps not too surprising that supporters of this conspiracy theory were taken in by a satirical article claiming that the Walt Disney Co., a global organization known for its wholesome children's entertainment, had purchased the website Pornhub, which ... well, is known for distinctly adult content.
On 17 May 2019, the Facebook page QAnon NC posted a link to an article from the satirical website The Beaverton under the caption: ""DID YOU KNOW #DISNEY OWNS #PORNHUB? Why is this not public knowledge? Disney executives pleased to announce acquisition of PornHub.""
A number of other social media users posted about Disney's alleged acquisition of Pornhub, including several accounts that mentioned the QAnon conspiracy theory in their profiles:
 






For the record, Disney has not purchased Pornhub.
The article being shared on social media in May 2019 was originally published on the entertainment website The Beaverton in June 2018 and read as follows:
""Expanding their media streaming portfolio, Disney executives announced that the company has acquired Canadian adult entertainment site, Pornhub ...
""This is part of our plan to expand our streaming capabilities,"" said Dalton Sterling, VP of Market Strategy in a call to shareholders, adding that it will allow them to leverage existing properties like Star Wars, Marvel, and the original cartoon characters to create franchise specific content that were thus far left to fans to create. ""This is what the online world was made for, and it would be unfair to our shareholders to not get a part of the action.""

This was not a genuine news article, as The Beaverton is a well-known entertainment site that publishes ""news satire and parody."" A disclaimer on the website reads as follows: ""The Beaverton is a news satire and parody publication. All articles contained within this website and on its social media accounts, however similar to real events, are fictitious. When public figures or actual businesses are mentioned by name, the corresponding story details are invented. In all other cases, any resemblance to actual persons, businesses or events is entirely coincidental.""
Pornhub is actually owned by a company called Mindgeek. And while the Walt Disney Co. is truly a media empire that encompasses properties such as ESPN, Pixar, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm Ltd., ABC News, Hulu, and Twentieth Century Fox in its portfolio, that empire has yet to venture into field of pornographic videos.

58.DoesTaggRomneyOwnOhi,"



1.5KQ: Does Mitt Romney's son Tagg own Ohio's electronic voting machines?
A: There's no evidence of that. A spokesman for Tagg Romney's private equity firm states that it has no stake in Hart InterCivic, a supplier of voting machines in two of Ohio's 88 counties.


FULL QUESTION
Is it true that Tagg Romney owns voting machines in Ohio?
FULL ANSWER
We have received a lot of emails from readers with questions about Ohio's voting machines -- all prompted by a conspiracy theory that suggests Mitt Romney supporters will ""steal"" the election by tampering with voting machines in the critical swing state of Ohio.
This theory has been fostered in recent weeks by some liberal bloggers and fanned by some Democrats, including Jennifer Brunner, who oversaw Ohio elections as the state's secretary of state. Brunner told MSNBC, ""It doesn't look good for a presidential candidate's son to be an investor in a voting machine company.""
But the facts are that Tagg Romney's company, Solamere Capital, does not own Hart InterCivic, the company that provides voting machines in Ohio, and there's no evidence that Solamere has even invested in it. Solamere says that it has no investment in Hart InterCivic and, therefore, no direct or indirect control over it.
It's true that the voting machine supplier is controlled by an investment firm whose executives are some of the biggest donors to the Romney campaign, and it's also true that Tagg Romney has done business with that investment firm. However, Hart InterCivic supplies electronic voting machines in just two of Ohio's 88 counties, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer.
A Flawed Conspiracy
The conspirators focus on the relationship between three companies:

Solamere Capital, a private equity firm founded by Tagg Romney
H.I.G. Capital, an investment firm whose employees have contributed nearly $450,000 to Mitt Romney's campaign
Hart InterCivic, one of the nation's largest suppliers of voting machines

In 2008, Tagg Romney, along with Spencer Zwich (currently Mitt Romney's national finance director), founded Solamere Capital. Mitt and Ann Romney contributed $10 million to the firm.
A spokesman for Solamere, who called us after we contacted the Romney campaign, told us that the company has 22 investments -- including one in H.I.G. BioVentures, a medical device fund that was started by H.I.G. Capital.
In 2011, H.I.G. Capital made a controlling investment in Hart InterCivic -- the voting machine vendor. Three of Hart InterCivic's five board members are H.I.G. executives: Neil Tuch, Jeff Bohl and Amanda Kalin.
Romney's critics are mixing up two different funds, the Solamere spokesman told us.
""Solamere invested in a fund that has absolutely nothing to do with the fund that invested in [Hart InterCivic],"" he said. ""It invested in a fund that invested in medical devices. It is wholly and entirely separate.""
The spokesman identified the fund as H.I.G. BioVentures.
""Neither Solamere nor its principals as individuals have any investment in the company or the fund that controls the company that makes the voting machines,"" the spokesman said.
A Solamere spokesman gave similar statements to Forbes' op-ed contributor Rick Ungar and the Weekly Standard.
Forbes, Oct. 20, 2012: According to a spokesperson who contacted me on Solamere's behalf, ""Neither Solamere nor its principals have any investment in or ownership of the company or the fund that controls the company.""
Weekly Standard, Oct. 23: ""Not only does Solamere have no direct or indirect interest in this company [Hart Intercivic], Solamere and its partners have no ownership in this company, nor do they have any ownership in nor have made any investments in the fund that invested in the voting machine company,"" the spokesman said.
We cannot independently confirm Solamere's statement, since it is a private company investing in another private company. But this much is clear: There is no evidence to disprove the company's public declaration that it did not invest in Hart InterCivic.
H.I.G. Capital, on the other hand, which does control Hart InterCivic, has clear ties to the Romney campaign -- another part of this conspiracy theory. H.I.G. Capital's cofounder and managing partner, Anthony Tamer, was a partner at Bain & Co., where Romney once served as CEO. Tamer, who is also managing partner of H.I.G. BioVentures, has donated $73,300 to Romney Victory Inc., a joint fundraising committee, and an additional $5,000 to Romney's presidential campaign committee.
In fact, many at H.I.G. Capital have contributed to Romney committees. H.I.G. Capital executives have given a combined $436,550, as of Oct. 25, to Romney's various political committees -- making them collectively the sixth-largest financial contributor to Romney fundraising committees, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.
Two of H.I.G. Capital's executive managing directors, Brian Schwartz and Douglas Berman, are also big Romney donors, federal campaign records show.
Schwartz gave $50,000 to the Romney Victory PAC and $5,000 to Romney's campaign committee in the last two years. He also gave $30,800 to the Republican National Committee, which Romney controls as the party's nominee. Berman, a former Bain & Co.  executive, gave $90,000 to the Romney Victory PAC -- donating $50,000 on two occasions in a four-month span this year (minus a $10,000 contribution refund).
In addition, an H.I.G. Capital executive who serves on Hart InterCivic's board (Bohl) has donated to Romney committees.
But, on the other hand, we see that another H.I.G. Capital executive who sits on the Hart InterCivic board (Tuch) gave to both Romney and Obama in the 2008 campaign, records show. Tuch has given no contributions to either candidate this cycle.
None of this, of course, is evidence that Hart InterCivic will tamper with the election results in Ohio or anywhere. It's just grist for a conspiracy theory -- a version of which has popped up every election cycle since 2004 because of concerns about the security of electronic machines.
Past Conspiracy Theories
Remember the swirl of stories around Diebold Election Systems and its CEO, Walden O'Dell, in 2004? O'Dell was an Ohio resident who held a fundraiser at his home for President Bush and wrote a fundraising letter promising to help ""Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year."" Some took him too literally, claiming that Bush ""stole"" Ohio's electoral votes and the 2004 election.
But even the liberal New York Times editorial board waved off that conspiracy theory as nonsense. There were some glitches, as expected, with the machines on Election Day, but, as the Times wrote, there was ""no evidence of vote theft or errors on a large scale.""
New York Times editorial, Nov. 14, 2004: It's important to make it clear that there is no evidence such a thing happened.
In 2008, there were concerns again about the potential for widespread fraud -- including concerns involving Hart InterCivic's electronic voting machines in, yes, Ohio.
A Dec. 7, 2007, report on electronic voting systems that was commissioned by the Ohio secretary of state (the aforementioned Brunner) discovered security problems with all the machines used in Ohio, including Hart InterCivic, as the New York Times reported.
New York Times, Dec. 15, 2007: The study released Friday found that voting machines and central servers made by Elections Systems and Software; Premier Election Solutions, formerly Diebold; and Hart InterCivic; were easily corrupted.
Chris Riggall, a Premier spokesman, said hardware and software problems had been corrected in his company's new products, which will be available for installation in 2008.
""It is important to note,"" he said, ""that there has not been a single documented case of a successful attack against an electronic voting system, in Ohio or anywhere in the United States.""
It's still true that there's not a single documented case of a sophisticated and widespread security breach.
Matthew Blaze, a University of Pennsylvania computer science professor and a coauthor of that Ohio report, continues to follow developments in the field. We asked him if he knew of any actual instances of such a security breach. He replied, ""I'm not aware of any documented cases of tampering,"" though one of the problems is that it's hard to detect.
What's more likely is human error or low-tech polling mischief.
Blaze wrote in 2009 about a case in Kentucky where eight poll workers were indicted for, among other things, tampering with ballots in Clay County during the 2006 elections. The poll workers, all of whom were convicted, took advantage of voters who were confused by the new machines. Some voters cast their ballots but failed to press the ""confirm vote"" box on the touch screen -- allowing poll workers to change the votes.
Blaze told us the Kentucky case was ""first example I'm aware of"" of any kind of vote tampering with electronic machines. But it's not the widespread, sophisticated kind of fraud that conspirators warned about in 2004 and again in 2012.
In fact, Blaze noted in his blog post that the voting machine tampered with in Kentucky -- iVotronic -- was one that he and others examined for flaws in its 2007 study of Ohio's machines. He wrote that ""none of the published security analyses of the iVotronic -- including the one we did at Penn -- had noticed the user interface weakness.""
So, what are we left with?
Tagg Romney does not own or control voting machines in Ohio. There's no evidence that he is even invested in them. There is a lot of money flowing from H.I.G. executives to Romney's political committees, but that's not evidence of wrongdoing -- just as it wasn't in 2004, when conspirators falsely accused O'Dell and Diebold of something they did not do.

77.DidaBillPassThatLets,"
In late December 2020, readers asked Snopes for verification of online rumors stating that a law went into effect recently allowing children to get vaccinated without the consent of their parents.
Some of the posts shared screenshots from a website, Conservative Brief, which misleadingly included a picture of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. Fauci has been at the forefront of the U.S. response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The meme led some readers to believe that a new nationwide law allows children 11 and older to get vaccinated without their parents' knowledge or consent. One reader inquired, ""Did The US just pass legislation that children can get the Covid vaccine without parental consent?""
The answer is no.
One such law did pass at the local level, in Washington, D.C., but had nothing to do with Fauci. According to the website for the D.C. Council, the law went into effect on Dec. 23, 2020.
It allows children as young as 11 in Washington, D.C., to get vaccines against a range of illnesses like polio, measles, mumps and rubella, as well as the COVID-19 coronavirus and human papillomavirus, if a doctor determines they are capable of giving informed consent. The vaccination record would be sent to the child's school, not to their parents, if the parents are using a religious exemption that allows their child to attend school without vaccines against communicable diseases.
The bill was originally introduced to the D.C. Council in early 2019 in response to an outbreak of measles. The intent was to circumvent parents who subscribe to anti-vaccine conspiracy theories and refuse to vaccinate their children, enabling such outbreaks.
Some of these children, like Ethan Lindenberger, have gotten themselves vaccinated against their parents' wishes and become public health advocates, and some states let teens get vaccines without parental consent.
In the face of the anti-vaccine conspiracy movement, some advocate for expanding the practice of letting children of a certain age decide for themselves whether to get vaccinated without their parents' knowledge. However, no nationwide law exists that allows children as young as 11 to receive a vaccine without parental consent.

5.DidCNNShowEdmontonCa,"
On March 27, 2022, the Telegram account @endilluminati posted a video from CNN with a false and misleading claim. The post with the CNN video showed anchors John Berman and Don Lemon and purported to show that the news network had rebroadcast old footage from a crude oil tank farm explosion in Edmonton, Canada, to represent an explosion in Lviv, Ukraine, during Russia's invasion in 2022.
The conspiracy theory arose after some users noticed some firefighters in Lviv were wearing gear with the word ""Edmonton"" on their backs.
According to CityNews Edmonton, the truth of the matter was simple. The reason why some of the firefighters in Lviv were seen wearing turnout coats with the word ""Edmonton"" was that firefighters in Canada had kindly donated some of their gear to Ukraine.
The Video
The original video of Lemon's reporting live from the aftermath of an explosion in Lviv was posted by a CNN anchor producer to Twitter. It was broadcast in the morning in the U.S., which was the evening for Ukraine:

BREAKING NEWS: Getting the first look from the scene of the airstrike in Lviv from @donlemon pic.twitter.com/rNT93EVu5T
-- Nora Neus (@noraneus) March 26, 2022 







The Debunked Conspiracy Theory
On Telegram, @endilluminati first posted a screenshot from the CNN video with Lemon with a circle around the word ""Edmonton"" on a firefighter and the following caption:
1. They filmed it in the U.S. or Canada.
2. They were donated.
But it's CNN we're talking about. Their credibility doesn't have a good standing.
The post was seen nearly 34,000 times and appeared like this:
The Telegram account first shared this post. It circled the word ""Edmonton"" on the back of one of the firefighters in Lviv.
Minutes later, the same Telegram account shared the video in question with these words: ""Explosions near Lviv or explosions from Edmonton crude oil tank farm in 2021?""
This Telegram post was seen nearly 36,000 times. 






This same CNN video from Telegram was later reshared to Facebook with the following misleading caption: ""CNN busted using cgi video...""
This reshare from Telegram to Facebook is an example of how repackaged misinformation can jump from platform to platform.
Lviv Explosion
On the same weekend, The Associated Press reported on what appeared to be the same fire and explosion at an ""oil storage facility"" in Lviv. The incident occurred on March 26:
LVIV, Ukraine -- The governor of the Lviv region says a man was detained on suspicion of espionage at the site of one of the two rocket attacks that rattled the city on Saturday.
Maksym Kozytskyy said police found the man had recorded a rocket flying toward the target and striking it. Police also found on his telephone photos of checkpoints in the region, which Kozytskyy said had been sent to two Russian telephone numbers.
Rockets hit an oil storage facility and an unspecified industrial facility, wounding at least five people. A thick plume of smoke and towering flames could be seen on Lviv's outskirts hours after the attacks.
'Edmonton' on Lviv Firefighter Turnout Coat
As previously mentioned, there was a reason why some of the firefighters in the CNN video from Lviv had ""Edmonton"" written across their backs. CityNews Edmonton reported that Edmonton firefighters had donated some coats to Lviv. It also showed this post that confirmed the fact:




A separate 2021 fire and explosion in Edmonton that was referenced by conspiracy theorists was reported on by Global News in October 2021.
In sum, no, CNN did not air a video from a 2021 crude oil tank farm explosion in Edmonton to represent Lviv in 2022. Lemon reported live from an explosion in a war zone, and all of the footage was genuine.

2.FakeShinzoAbeTweetDr,"



Quick Take
Internet trolls have used the death of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and a fake tweet purportedly from Abe, to promote a long-standing, unfounded conspiracy theory that the Clintons are responsible for the deaths of multiple people. A suspect reportedly with a personal grudge has been arrested for the assassination.

Full Story
Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was assassinated on July 8, and almost immediately, misinformation about who was responsible started circulating on social media in Japan and elsewhere.
Now a false claim suggesting that Hillary Clinton was behind the killing is making the rounds on social media in the U.S.
In reality, Tetsuya Yamagami, 41, was arrested and reportedly admitted to police that he had targeted Abe because he believed the former prime minister had helped to promote an organization against which he held a personal grudge.
But social media accounts are sharing a fake tweet purportedly from Abe the day before he died that says, ""I have information that will lead to the arrest of Hillary Clinton.""
Some conservative outlets have published suggestive headlines based on the fabricated tweet.
For example, the Western Journal used this headline: ""Fact Check: Did Japan's Ex-PM Incriminate Hillary Clinton 1 Day Before Being Assassinated?"" Although the full article explained that the tweet was fake, the Western Journal's Instagram post didn't explain that. Some of those who commented on the post said, ""I wouldn't doubt it,"" ""Guns don't kill people the Clintons do!!!"" and ""The Clinton body count!!!! We all know!!!""
The last comment is a reference to the well-worn conspiracy theory that former President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee for president, have killed many people in order to cover up alleged crimes. In this case, as in the others, there's nothing to the claim. 
The last tweet from Abe's Twitter account promoted another Japanese politician, and there's no indication that he had tweeted anything recently about Clinton. Actually, the Japanese text included in the fake tweet doesn't say anything about Clinton either, as a story from the Associated Press pointed out.
The fake tweet has been treated as a joke in many online communities and appears to have spawned a second fake tweet, one purported to be from Clinton herself, saying, in part, ""I did not have murderous intentions toward that Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe. I never told anybody to kill him. Not a single time. Never.""
But for social media users not versed in political meme culture, it can appear that such tweets are real. For example, Reuters noted in a story about the fake Abe tweet that some Twitter users expressed confusion, saying things such as, ""Is this real? I don't see it on his Twitter"" and ""Did Shinzo Abe tweet this???""
So, what might be a joke to some can be taken in earnest by others. In any case, Abe didn't implicate Clinton in his death by tweeting about her beforehand.

97.FactcheckingDonaldTr,"
It was supposed to be the second presidential debate. Instead, President Donald Trump refused a virtual debate and followed Joe Biden's lead of doing a town hall on network television.
NBC host Savannah Guthrie started the Trump town hall by trying to nail down his last negative test for the coronavirus. He said he couldn't remember and went on to repeat a number of falsehoods and exaggerations -- some old, some new -- about the state of the crisis, the efficacy of face masks and pandemic-driven immigration restrictions.
Over on ABC with George Stephanopoulos, Biden had harsh criticism for Trump's track record on COVID-19, focusing on Trump's failure to give people more warning in March and April, as well as Trump's failure to lead on masks or the acquisition of personal protective equipment. Biden gave lengthy answers to voter questions on systemic racism, policing, income inequality, climate change and the Supreme Court. 
Here's what the candidates said on key issues, fact-checked in one place.
Coronavirus
Trump: ""Just the other day, they came out with a statement that 85% of the people that wear masks catch it.""
Rating: False
A report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked at situations that put people at risk for COVID-19, using a small survey of 314 people. The report showed a correlation between testing positive for the coronavirus and going to bars and restaurants, where masks can't be effectively worn. It did not look at the odds of mask wearers catching the disease. More importantly, the strategy of mask wearing is less about protecting the wearer and more about preventing the spread of the virus. Experts say they offer the wearer some -- but not total -- protection.
Trump: With COVID-19, ""We have done an amazing job, and it's rounding the corner."" 
This is misleading. There has been progress in treating the disease, and vaccine development is moving forward. But cases and hospitalizations are increasing. The country just saw the number of new cases go over 60,000 in a single day, a number not reached since early August.
Hospitalizations, a more serious indication of the virus's impact, have started rising steadily.

The death toll remains at about 700 a day, on a rolling seven-day average.
Trump: After being told his administration curtailed DACA, ""What happened is because of the pandemic, much changed on the immigration front. Mexico is heavily infected, as you know, and we've made it very, very difficult to come in because of the pandemic and other reasons, and crime.""
Rating: False
Trump's attempt to end the Obama-era program Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals started in 2017, his first year in office, way before the coronavirus pandemic. Legal challenges to Trump's efforts have left that program in place, with some caveats. The administration is required to process renewal applications for immigrants who have been granted DACA and want to renew it. However, immigrants who have never had DACA are not allowed to file an application seeking the protection for the first time.
The Trump administration has also reduced the length of the DACA protection, from two years to one. DACA does not benefit people who are newly arriving at the border. To have been eligible for DACA, people had to be continuously in the United States since June 15, 2007, and have no felony convictions, among other criteria.
Trump: Says Biden ""called me xenophobic and racist"" over a restriction on travel from China.
Rating: Mostly False
Biden has not directly said that the travel restrictions were xenophobic. Around the time the Trump administration announced the travel restriction, Biden said that Trump had a ""record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering."" Biden used the phrase ""xenophobic"" in reply to a Trump tweet about limiting entry to travelers from China and in which Trump described the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus."" Biden did not specify which part of Trump's tweet was xenophobic.
Biden: Says Trump said people should ""inject bleach in your arm and that's going to work. I'm not being facetious; he actually said these things."" 
Trump said something like this, but his comments weren't as clear as Biden suggests. Here's Trump's direct quote from April 23: ""And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it'd be interesting to check that, so that you're going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me."" 
Regardless of what Trump actually meant, his remarks caused some companies and state agencies to issue warnings about ingesting disinfectants. The maker of Lysol said in a statement that ""under no circumstance"" should its products be used in the human body.

White supremacy and conspiracy theories
When Guthrie asked Trump about white supremacy and conspiracy theories, Trump cut her off, saying, ""You always do this,"" and asking why NBC didn't ask Biden if he denounced antifa. Guthrie asked whether he would ""once and for all"" state that the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory is not true, but Trump declined, saying he knew nothing about it but did know about the ""vicious"" and ""radical left."" Guthrie asked why he promoted the ""lie"" that Biden worked to have Navy SEAL Team Six killed in order to cover up a failed Iran deal and the faked death of Osama bin Laden.
Trump: ""I know nothing about it ... That was a retweet. That was an opinion of somebody. And that was a retweet. I'll put it out there, people can decide for themselves. I don't take a position.""
The conspiracy theory Trump shared rates Pants on Fire; it isn't up for debate. Two military investigations determined the 2011 crash that killed 15 members of SEAL Team Six happened as the result of a grenade shot by the Taliban. Osama bin Laden was killed in a 2012 SEAL Team Six raid.
Trump: ""Why doesn't (Biden) condemn antifa?""
Biden has condemned antifa, a term used for a collection of far-left, anti-fascist groups that rally against white supremacy and other causes, at times resorting to violence. A reporter for WGAL, an NBC affiliate in Pennsylvania, asked Biden in September whether he condemned antifa. ""Yes, I do, violence no matter who it is,"" Biden said. Biden on several occasions also has denounced violence, arson and looting tied to protests against police brutality. 
Trump: ""I know nothing about QAnon. ... I do know they are very much against pedophilia. They fight it very hard. But I know nothing about it.""
Trump has amplified QAnon accounts on Twitter and supported political candidates who subscribe to the conspiracy theory, which claims Democrats and celebrities are Satan-worshipping, cannibalistic pedophiles. 
Reporters have asked Trump about QAnon several times. At an Aug. 19 press conference, Trump said he didn't know much about QAnon, ""other than I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate."" Trump said the movement was gaining popularity and that its supporters ""don't like what they're seeing, what's going on in places like Portland, in places like Chicago and New York and other cities and states. And I've heard these are people that love our country and they just don't like seeing it.""
Trump's record
Trump: ""We had the greatest economy in the history of our country last year.""
Rating: False
Before the pandemic, the unemployment rate plunged to levels that it hasn't touched since the early 1950s. But growth in the nation's gross domestic product -- probably the single most important statistic used to gauge the overall strength of the economy -- has been so-so on Trump's watch. It never reached the 4% he promised, and once you consider the impact of population growth and inflation, the economy ranks 16th compared with past years. Wage growth was much less than the 2% per year during the 1960s. Finally, unlike periods of growth in the 1960s and 1990s, the federal budget deficit grew.
Trump: ""I have done more for the African American community than any president, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln.""
This needs a significant amount of context. Before the pandemic hit the economy, Trump could point to historically low Black unemployment rates. Since then, however, job losses have fallen disproportionately on the Black community. Setting the pandemic aside, Trump overlooks the groundbreaking laws passed during the years of President Lyndon B. Johnson. Historians rank the gains made under Johnson second only to Lincoln. The Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act protected civil, political and economic rights for Black people that had been denied for over a century.
Trump did sign a sweeping criminal justice bill. It passed with full Democratic support, and it built upon the reforms launched by President Barack Obama. Among other steps, Obama signed a law to reduce sentencing disparities between powder and crack cocaine, he banned federal agencies from initially asking job applicants about past convictions, and he pushed for police reforms to improve safety and reduce unnecessary arrests and shootings.
Trump: ""Car companies are moving into Michigan, into Ohio, into South Carolina and North Carolina.""
This exaggerates. Trump is correct about Michigan -- Fiat Chrysler announced plans for a new plant there in 2019 -- and he could have mentioned Alabama and the Toyota-Mazda joint venture announced there in 2018.
Beyond those two, the facts tell a different story. In Ohio, there have been investments in existing plants, but no new assembly plants built. A Volvo complex in South Carolina was announced in 2015, which preceded Trump policies and the 2017 tax law. We can find no example of a new assembly plant announced in North Carolina. We reached out to the Trump campaign and are waiting to hear back. 
Trump: ""We gave you the greatest tax cuts in the history of our country.""
Rating: False
The ""greatest"" tax cuts is subjective, but the tax bill Trump signed in 2017 was not the biggest ever, as the president has frequently asserted. The Joint Committee on Taxation -- Congress's nonpartisan arbiter of tax analysis -- said the 2017 tax bill would cost the government (or save taxpayers) about $1.5 trillion over 10 years, or about $150 billion a year. Several bills since 1980 were larger, according to the Treasury Department, measured not only by contemporary dollars but also by inflation-adjusted dollars and as a percentage of gross domestic product, which is a measure of the size of the overall economy. In inflation-adjusted dollars, the 2017 tax bill is the fourth-largest since 1940. And as a percentage of GDP, it ranks seventh.

Biden: Says Trump in effect told the U.S. Justice Department, ""I'm being sued because a woman accused me of rape. Represent me. Personally represent me in the state of New York on not allowing my tax returns (to be disclosed.)""
This is accurate but needs explanation. In September, the Justice Department filed papers seeking to defend Trump in a defamation lawsuit by E. Jean Carroll who accused Trump of raping her in the 1990s in a department store. Carroll wrote about her claim in a memoir last year. Trump denied the rape allegation in June 2019 and said Carroll was ""totally lying."" Carroll, a journalist, sued Trump in November in New York state court saying he damaged her reputation. 
In the court filing, the Justice Department argued that it should be able to represent Trump because the president was acting within the scope of his public office when he denied the allegation. The department asked the court to make the U.S. government the defendant rather than Trump.
Carroll's lawyers have fought against the Justice Department intervening in the case, which is now in federal court.
In the tax case, in 2019 the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York filed a statement of interest to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.'s subpoena for Trump's tax returns. Federal prosecutors wrote that there were ""serious constitutional issues at stake in this proceeding."" The district attorney called the move a delay tactic. In October, a federal appeals panel ruled that the district attorney can proceed with the subpoenas. The Justice Department said it was reviewing the ruling.
Policing
Biden: ""They eliminated the funding for community policing.""
Rating: False
At the town hall, Biden touted the Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS, program, which was enacted as part of the 1994 crime bill. The 1994 bill, which Biden spearheaded, included some provisions on prosecution and sentencing that have recently been criticized for exacerbating criminal justice disparities for minority groups. But Biden highlighted other parts of the law that have been more popular.
The idea behind community policing was to develop new policing strategies focused on engaging officers members of the community on their beat, rather than seeming like an occupying force.
However, Biden exaggerated when he said that funding for the program was ""eliminated."" (He was vague about who eliminated the funding, and when.) While the program is smaller than it was in its early years, when its budget ranged between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion, it was never zeroed out. Since 2012, which was under the Obama-Biden administration, funding has been around $200 million a year.
Biden's campaign told PolitiFact that he was referring to Trump's fiscal 2019 budget proposal, which would have halved funding for the community policing program. But this wasn't enacted, and did not amount to an elimination.
Here's a rundown of the annual budgetary authority for the COPS program from the Congressional Research Service:

 

Trump: ""But criminal justice reform, everybody said it could not be done. President Obama and Biden never even tried to do it.""
Rating: False
After the 2014 fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., Obama created a task force to specifically identify better policing practices. The task force issued its final report in May 2015, after holding public listening sessions across the country and getting testimony and recommendations from community and faith leaders, law enforcement officers, academics, and others.
In 2016, the Justice Department under Obama said it would continue to help implement the task force's findings and train law enforcement agents to recognize and address implicit bias, unconscious or subtle associations that individuals make between groups of people and stereotypes about those groups. The Obama administration also investigated patterns or practices of misconduct in police departments and entered into court-binding agreements that require departments to correct misconduct.

 
Climate change
Biden: Says he didn't label the Green New Deal a ""crucial framework,"" but used that term to describe his own plan, which differs from the Green New Deal.
During a discussion of climate change, Stephanopoulos said that Biden had called the Green New Deal a ""crucial framework."" Biden disagreed, saying, ""My deal is a crucial framework,"" because his proposal was more realistic. 
This gets things wrong on two fronts.
First, an issue page on Biden's own campaign website does use the term ""crucial framework"" to describe the Green New Deal.
""Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face,"" the campaign web page says. ""It powerfully captures two basic truths, which are at the core of his plan: (1) the United States urgently needs to embrace greater ambition on an epic scale to meet the scope of this challenge, and (2) our environment and our economy are completely and totally connected.""
Second, during the town hall, Biden characterized the Green New Deal as calling ""for elimination of all non-renewable energy by 2030. You can't get there. You're going to need to be able to transition."" By contrast, Biden's plan would set a goal of ""net-zero emissions no later than 2050.""
Biden's summary of the Green New Deal was incorrect. The 2019 Green New Deal resolution sponsored by Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., called for ""global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from human sources of 40% to 60% from 2010 levels by 2030, and net-zero global emissions by 2050.""
This means Biden's plan and the Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal are essentially in accord on the timeline for net-zero emissions. 
Instead, the biggest contrast between the two plans come on issues distinct from climate change, such as universal access to high-quality health care and affordable housing. While Biden supports some of these goals, his climate plan doesn't specifically include them. 
The Biden campaign told PolitiFact that Biden acknowledges that the Green New Deal is a crucial framework to arrange thinking on climate because it articulates an urgent need for action and the interconnectedness of environmental and economic issues. But the campaign said his plan remains his own.
The Supreme Court
Biden: Amy Coney Barrett ""didn't answer very many questions at all, and I don't even think she has laid out much of a judicial philosophy.""
This is inaccurate. During confirmation hearings, Barrett has not given direct answers to some questions such as whether a president can pardon himself, but she has made comments that show her judicial philosophy.
On Oct. 13, Barrett testified that she is an originalist. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked her to explain what that means. ""That means that I interpret the Constitution as a law, that I interpret its text as text, and I understand it to have the meaning that it had at the time people ratified it. So that meaning doesn't change over time, and it's not up to me to update it or infuse my own policy views into it,"" she said.
Barrett said that she shared Justice Antonin Scalia's philosophy. ""I would say that Justice Scalia was obviously a mentor, and as I said when I accepted the president's nomination, that his philosophy is mine too,"" she said. ""He was a very eloquent defender of originalism, And that was also true of textualism, which is the way that I approach statutes and their interpretation.""
George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley told NPR that Barrett showed a ""full-throated, unambiguous embrace of originalism. Indeed, I can't remember as strong a statement coming from any modern nominee.""

Search engines are one of society's primary gateways to information and people, but they are also conduits for misinformation.

This article about misinformation is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.
 






Search engines are one of society's primary gateways to information and people, but they are also conduits for misinformation. Similar to problematic social media algorithms, search engines learn to serve you what you and others have clicked on before. Because people are drawn to the sensational, this dance between algorithms and human nature can foster the spread of misinformation.
Search engine companies, like most online services, make money not only by selling ads, but also by tracking users and selling their data through real-time bidding on it. People are often led to misinformation by their desire for sensational and entertaining news as well as information that is either controversial or confirms their views. One study found that more popular YouTube videos about diabetes are less likely to have medically valid information than less popular videos on the subject, for instance.
Ad-driven search engines, like social media platforms, are designed to reward clicking on enticing links because it helps the search companies boost their business metrics. As a researcher who studies the search and recommendation systems, I and my colleagues show that this dangerous combination of corporate profit motive and individual susceptibility makes the problem difficult to fix.
How search results go wrong
When you click on a search result, the search algorithm learns that the link you clicked is relevant for your search query. This is called relevance feedback. This feedback helps the search engine give higher weight to that link for that query in the future. If enough people click on that link enough times, thus giving strong relevance feedback, that website starts coming up higher in search results for that and related queries. 
People are more likely to click on links shown up higher on the search results list. This creates a positive feedback loop - the higher a website shows up, the more the clicks, and that in turn makes that website move higher or keep it higher. Search engine optimization techniques use this knowledge to increase the visibility of websites. 
There are two aspects to this misinformation problem: how a search algorithm is evaluated and how humans react to headlines, titles and snippets. Search engines, like most online services, are judged using an array of metrics, one of which is user engagement. It is in the search engine companies' best interest to give you things that you want to read, watch or simply click. Therefore, as a search engine or any recommendation system creates a list of items to present, it calculates the likelihood that you'll click on the items. 
Traditionally, this was meant to bring out the information that would be most relevant. However, the notion of relevance has gotten fuzzy because people have been using search to find entertaining search results as well as truly relevant information. 






Imagine you are looking for a piano tuner. If someone shows you a video of a cat playing a piano, would you click on it? Many would, even if that has nothing to do with piano tuning. The search service feels validated with positive relevance feedback and learns that it is OK to show a cat playing a piano when people search for piano tuners. 
In fact, it is even better than showing the relevant results in many cases. People like watching funny cat videos, and the search system gets more clicks and user engagement. 
This might seem harmless. So what if people get distracted from time to time and click on results that aren't relevant to the search query? The problem is that people are drawn to exciting images and sensational headlines. They tend to click on conspiracy theories and sensationalized news, not just cats playing piano, and do so more than clicking on real news or relevant information.
Famous but fake spiders
In 2018, searches for ""new deadly spider"" spiked on Google following a Facebook post that claimed a new deadly spider killed several people in multiple states. My colleagues and I analyzed the top 100 results from Google search for ""new deadly spider"" during the first week of this trending query. 


The first two pages of Google search results for 'new deadly spider' in August 2018 (shaded area) were related to the original fake news post about that subject, not debunking or otherwise factual information.
Chirag Shah, CC BY-ND

 






It turned out this story was fake, but people searching for it were largely exposed to misinformation related to the original fake post. As people continued clicking and sharing that misinformation, Google continued serving those pages at the top of the search results. 
This pattern of thrilling and unverified stories emerging and people clicking on them continues, with people apparently either being unconcerned with the truth or believing that if a trusted service such as Google Search is showing these stories to them then the stories must be true. More recently, a disproven report claiming China let the coronavirus leak from a lab gained traction on search engines because of this vicious cycle.
Spot the misinformation
To test how well people discriminate between accurate information and misinformation, we designed a simple game called ""Google Or Not."" This online game shows two sets of results for the same query. The objective is simple - pick the set that is reliable, trustworthy or most relevant.


In tests, about half the time people can't tell the difference between Google search results containing misinformation and those with only trustworthy results.
Chirag Shah, CC BY-ND


One of these two sets has one or two results that are either verified and labeled as misinformation or a debunked story. We made the game available publicly and advertised through various social media channels. Overall, we collected 2,100 responses from over 30 countries.  






When we analyzed the results, we found that about half the time people mistakenly picked as trustworthy the set with one or two misinformation results. Our experiments with hundreds of other users over many iterations have resulted in similar findings. In other words, about half the time people are picking results that contain conspiracy theories and fake news. As more people pick these inaccurate and misleading results, the search engines learn that that's what people want.
Questions of Big Tech regulation and self-regulation aside, it's important for people to understand how these systems work and how they make money. Otherwise market economies and people's natural inclination to be attracted to eye-catching links will keep the vicious cycle going.

135.BlackMobBeatsWhiteMa,"
On 10 November 2016, conspiracy theory web site InfoWars posted a video of a white man being pushed and kicked by a group of younger African-American people. (The article bore the inflammatory headline, ""SHOCK VIDEO: BLACK MOB VICIOUSLY BEATS WHITE TUMP VOTER."")
The roughly 30-second YouTube video showed an older white man in a blue sweatshirt getting pushed to the ground and kicked by the younger people, while several people can be heard off-camera accusing him of voting for Donald Trump. A longer version of the video posted to Twitter is accompanied by the song ""Fuck Donald Trump,"" and shows the man clinging to his car and being dragged as someone drives away in it. Both the YouTube video and Twitter post have since been deleted.
Chicago police told us that officers responded to a battery call on 9 November 2016 in which the 50-year-old victim reported being battered in a traffic-related altercation involving three unidentified males and two females, one of whom drove away in the man's car. A spokeswoman told us:
Our Area North detectives are investigating. We're aware of the video. The [incident] report has nothing political in nature. We forwarded the video to detectives, so they're investigating.
The man was transported to a nearby hospital in good condition, she said. 






The victim, David Wilcox, 49, spoke to the Chicago Tribune in an interview published 11 November 2016. He told the paper he did vote for Trump, but no one in the crowd could have known that. He said the crowd was egging on the beating with taunts, but the incident did start with a car accident:
A man shown in a viral video getting punched and kicked as a crowd yells, ""Don't vote Trump"" acknowledges he supports Donald Trump but said Thursday that's not what started the beating on the West Side the day after the presidential election.
David Wilcox, 49, said he was about to turn left from Kedzie Avenue to Roosevelt Road around 1 p.m. when a black sedan pulled up and scraped the right side of his Pontiac Bonneville.
Wilcox said he did vote for Trump, but no one in the crowd would have known that. He said the taunts appeared to come from people watching the beating, including one person at the bus stop who he heard say, ""Yeah, it's one of them white boy Trump guys.""
The clip has since been shared by white supremacist publication The Daily Stormer with the following text:
We are bringing back law and order to this country.
The age of the rabid monkey is closing.
Let them take to the streets for their last big hurrah.
Because in a couple of short months, America becomes Trumpland.
And in Trumpland, criminals are punished with swift brutality. And cops are immune from prosecution.
While it's clear Wilcox was assaulted, it seems from initial police reports and his own statements that the assault stemmed from a traffic incident. Bystanders are heard taunting him for voting for Trump, but that's not what the impetus for the beating was.
It's also not clear, as some publications are claiming, that the battery suspects in the video were supporters of Trump's Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. One woman can be heard off camera asking, ""Are you gonna pay for my shit?"" which seems to align with the police statement that the fight stemmed from a traffic accident resulting in property damage.
Further, the racial undertones of some of the posts surrounding the video raises the possibility that the incident is being exploited in order to further inflame tensions on the heels of a charged and contentious election.
On 22 November 2016, the Chicago Police Department notified us that they were unable to release a copy of the police report because doing so could jeopardize their ongoing investigation into the incident, and because some of those involved are juveniles.
On 18 November 2016, the Chicago Tribune reported that three adults and one teenager were charged with one count each of felony vehicular hijacking.

This article by Giulio Corsi is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.

Climate change denial is a moving target. In the past, it consisted of a fully fledged denial of any scientific evidence that the world was warming. More recently, it has evolved into a creative mix of strategies. Deniers today often contradict part of the scientific basis for climate change, while pinning the blame for the rest - anything completely undeniable, even to them - on developing countries, particularly India and China. 
Over the past few weeks, a new figure has emerged: Naomi Seibt. Seibt, the so-called anti-Greta Thunberg, a 19-year-old from Munster in Germany, rapidly gained media attention for her call for ""climate realism"", claiming that climate change science really is not science at all, and for this reason, there is no need to panic. The young activist immediately caught the eye of the lively US denier scene and was - just months after publishing her first YouTube video - invited to speak at the high-profile Conservative Political Action Conference 2020 (CPAC) and made a member of the Heartland Institute, a thinktank known for its ties to the fossil-fuel industry. 






As an academic who researches climate disinformation strategies, I found her sudden emergence very interesting. Combing through Seibst's speeches available online, I had a chance to analyse her own style of denial, coming across a number of cliched ""skeptical"" arguments that have been repeatedly debunked in the past. 


Seibst at The Heartland Institute. (Spoiler: the prediction did not fail)
The Heartland Institute / Youtube


What was perhaps most interesting, was her use of a recurrent argument on the supposed ""historical rebranding"" of climate change. The theory goes as follows: in the past, everyone used the term global warming to describe this phenomenon, but seeing that the planet was, in fact, not heating, global warming was ""rebranded"" to climate change in a sophisticated cover-up. 
Clearly, this hypothesis is flawed, as the Earth is unequivocally warming. Despite this, the idea appears to be widely held in the denialist scene -  to take one prominent example, Donald Trump tweeted it more than 20 times in the two years before he became president. 

Tremendous cold wave hits large part of U.S. Lucky they changed the name from global warming to climate change - G.W. just doesn't work!
-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 16, 2014
 






So, was there really a conspiracy to rebrand climate change?
Even deniers used 'climate change'
To find out whether there is some truth underlying the ""rebranding theory"", I analysed 30 years (1990-2019) of data containing the terms global warming and climate change from five sources: the academic literature repositories Scopus and Web of Science, the British newspapers The Times and The Guardian, and the articles published by the Heartland Institute itself. 
This mix of sources provides a nice overview of how the two terms have been used over time. If the theory is true, we would expect the use of global warming to be dominant in the past, to then slowly be substituted by climate change. Let's see what the data says.
First, the academic literature has always preferred the more comprehensive term climate change, and there is no single point in time where articles mentioning global warming exceed those mentioning climate change on Scopus and Web of Science. Yet the gap between the two terms increases significantly after the Kyoto Protocol entered into force in 2005, a watershed year for climate governance.


Climate change is the most common term - but it's not a recent rebrand.
Giulio Corsi, Author provided

 






On the other hand, newspapers behaved somewhat differently. In both The Guardian and The Times, climate change is generally the most common term, but the two are used interchangeably until 2005 when again we see a breaking point. Despite this, climate change was in use long before any possible rebranding. 
Yet the most interesting findings come from looking at data from the Heartland Institute. In fact, the thinktank used the two terms with roughly the same frequency until 2013, when we finally see a decoupling as the use of global warming dropped while the use of climate change remained constant. 
This shows that ""global warming"" was widely used by climate change deniers over this 30-year period. Perhaps this is because the phrase is relatively specific, which allowed them to contrast it with simple arguments like saying that the planet cannot be warming as it's cold outside.
 In 2015 US senator James Inhofe brought a snowball into congress to show climate change wasn't real.

Different terms, same problem
Looking at the data, it is safe to say that there was no historical rebranding of climate change, as global warming was never the most commonly used term in the first place. Rather, it is evident how, over time, newspapers and academics used different phrases to represent the same phenomenon, as newspapers tended to use global warming very frequently until 2005, while this term was never common in the scientific literature.  






Climate change deniers are known to often misrepresent innocuous facts and use them to their advantage, and this case was no exception: a simple evolution in language was transformed into an unfounded conspiracy theory. While the latter was easy to debunk by looking at the data, these sorts of arguments are dangerous smokescreens, designed to shift the focus of the debate away from the need for decisive measures to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Whatever we decide to call it, climate change is happening, and it calls for urgent action.

Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.
On Dec. 11, 2020, a Twitter user posted a new permutation of a conspiracy theory about Dominion Voting Systems, the technology firm that provided voting systems in multiple U.S. jurisdictions in the November 2020 election, and which has also been the target of a disinformation campaign falsely claiming its systems were used to perpetrate widespread voter fraud.
One of the narratives in the election fraud conspiracy theory holds that voting machines provided by Dominion switched votes from ballots cast for U.S. President Donald Trump to his challenger, Joe Biden, who is now president-elect. Trump has refused to accept his electoral loss, and has perpetuated the lie that Dominion machines were used en masse to flip votes.
Hence, more than a month after Biden was declared winner of the election, conspiracy theories continued to flourish. In this case, a Twitter user falsely claimed that Dominion is owned by a member of Biden family, namely his nephew. But the tweet in question is nothing but a patchwork of misleading screenshots and assumptions, based on people sharing a common surname. We cropped the user's name out below:
 






The screenshots in the meme above contain what appear to be the professional biographies of two men, Stephen Owens and R. Kevin Owens, neither of which mentions Dominion.
The meme included in the tweet points to President-elect Biden's sister and campaign manager Valerie Biden Owens, with the alleged clincher being that Stephen Owens, a co-founder of Staple Street Capital, an investment firm that owns 75% stake in Dominion, shares a surname. However, ""Owens"" is a common last name, so that hardly serves as proof at all.
Valerie and her husband, John T. Owens, have three children, none named Stephen. A spokesperson for Staple Street confirmed in an email to Snopes that Stephen Owens has no relation to the Biden family.
And although the meme includes mention of R. Kevin Owens, an attorney who is related to Valerie's husband, we see no connection between this person and Dominion.
In other iterations of this conspiracy theory, the voting systems company has been falsely linked to deceased Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, as well as various Democratic politicians, including U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, and the Clinton Foundation, the charitable foundation run by former President Bill and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
Trump's own administration has undermined his post-election disinformation blitz by stating the November 2020 election was ""the most secure in American history.""
""There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised,"" the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which is a component of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said in a Nov. 12, 2020, statement.

88.DidMusicianDrCreepPr,"
A rapper named Dr. Creep predicted the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in a song, if the internet's conspiracy theories are to be believed. Much like other stories we have covered about coronavirus predictions, we found this one to be untrue.
Numerous posts online honed in on one particular lyric from his 2013 song ""Pandemic."" The lyric says, ""2020 combined with coronavirus, bodies stacking."" One conspiracy theorist argued: ""I find it rather hard to believe the somewhat aptly named Dr Creep wasn't somehow passed a drop of advance information from a mystery someone on the inside.""
The specific lyrics can be heard around the 1:07 mark:





But Dr. Creep himself denied that he predicted the pandemic. In March 2020, he posted on his Facebook page that the lyrics were ""more of a coincidence than a prediction as I don't feel I was 'trying' to predict anything, I just rapped about what I was watching.""




The story of a novel coronavirus was indeed reported on back in 2013 by numerous outlets including the World Health Organization (WHO). But it was not the SARS-CoV-2 virus, also named COVID-19, that began in 2019.
Given that Dr. Creep himself denied that he made a prediction, we rate this claim as ""False.""

The Anti-Defamation League keeps a database of hate symbols frequently used by white supremacist groups, among other hate groups. 
An image being shared on social media looks like a newer entry in the league's so-called Hate on Display database, classifying the anti-Biden saying ""Let's go Brandon"" as a hate slogan. 
""The phrase 'Let's go Brandon' is a far-right extremist dog whistle that became popular among supporters of Donald Trump and his overly anti-democratic views, particularly among adherents of the MAGA movement who believes in the debunked 2020 election fraud conspiracy theory,"" the grammatically problematic entry says.

177.DidUSSpecialForcesKi,"
In the summer of 2016, several personalities and web sites dedicated to discussing supernatural myths and conspiracy theories began claiming that an American Special Forces soldier serving in Kandahar, Afghanistan, was killed in 2002 by a 1,100-pound, blade-wielding, 12-foot-tall giant from Old Testament times before the giant himself was taken down by the military.
A Department of Defense spokesman told us they have no record of such an incident:
We do not have any record or information about a special forces member killed by a giant in Kandahar.
Current interest in the story appears to have been generated from a video created by L.A. Marzulli, an author, blogger and filmmaker determined to link modern times with biblical creatures and prophecies. On 13 August 2016, he posted an episode on YouTube of his series, Watchers, in which he claims to interview a military contractor or soldier who witnessed the blade-wielding ""Giant of Kandahar"" kill another soldier before being downed by troops, whisked away by a transport aircraft and hidden away from public view.
Marzulli makes the case that the giant was a Nephilim, which were described in the Book of Genesis as offspring of gods and human women who inhabited Canaan at the time of Israelite conquest. But when it comes down to details, he's vague, saying he interviewed the unnamed man at an ""undisclosed location"" on an unknown date. The interviewee who he claims shot and killed the giant, doesn't give any details on the location of the alleged incident, other than to say it was a ""remote"" location in Afghanistan in 2002. He claims he and others were sent in to look for a missing patrol when they saw a scarlet-haired giant emerge from a cave and skewer his friend, who he called ""Dan,"" with a large blade.
If the Army's statement isn't sufficient, the only service member with the first name Dan or Daniel who died in Kandahar in 2002 was killed -- along with three others -- in an accident involving the clearing and disposal of explosives. There are no incidents on the Department of Defense press release page, in which all military casualties were listed, involving a giant. Likewise, there are no reports of an entire patrol disappearing in Afghanistan.
Marzulli's video about the alleged giant incident, replete with a growling animation, can be seen here:

153.USCaughtRepaintingFi,"
In October 2016, a set of viral images that showed U.S. fighter jets repainted to look like Russian airplanes generated a scuttlebutt that they were probably going to be used in a ""false flag"" attack on Syria (or some other target) for which Russia would be blamed:
By repainting these fighter jets, they can send them out on bombing missions, make certain they fly low and slow around a target a few times so people on the ground whip out their cellphone cameras to video the attack, bomb the hell out of something and then sit back as all the civilian videos come out on social media showing a ""Russian"" plane committing the act!  The perfect set up.
For training purposes, U.S. fighter planes assigned to ""aggressor squadrons"" (a la Top Gun) are often repainted to resemble the aircraft of potential adversaries. There's nothing novel or unusual about it. In fact, the Marine Corps publicizes the practice.
Three of the viral images offered different views of an F/A-18 Hornet strike fighter redone to look something like a Russian Sukhoi Su-34 (actual plane shown in the lower-right-hand photo):

As to the notion that the repainted F/A-18s could fly ""low and slow"" before attacking, allowing witnesses to take cell phone photos which would then be used to deceive the world into thinking that Russia was behind it, there's a rather large hole in that conspiracy theory. No matter how they're painted, the Hornet and Sukhoi planes are shaped very differently. A subset of social media users conversant in aviation would recognize the former as American-made in no time.

283.IsVolkswagens300MPGC,"

Claim:   The federal government is preventing Volkswagen's XL1 model car from being sold in the U.S. because the vehicle is too fuel-efficient.

FALSE 







Examples:   [Collected via e-mail, September 2013]

Volkswagen's New 300 MPG Car Not Allowed In America Because It Is Too Efficient
Would like to know of the article is valid.

   
Origins:   For many years conspiracy rumors have circulated positing that a collusion between Big Oil and the U.S. government has prevented the American public from having the opportunity to purchase fully developed, market-ready automobiles capable of obtaining fuel efficiencies of 200-300 MPG.  Such rumors have taken the form of everything from mysterious forces stealing cars equipped with miracle carburetors to keep that technology's existence a secret, to the federal government's enacting regulations intended for the sole purpose of keeping high-mileage vehicles out of the U.S. market in order to protect the interests (and profits) of American oil companies.
April 2014 saw the emergence of yet another entry in this vein, courtesy of Jim Stone, Freelance Journalist (the same ""journalist"" who promulgated the ridiculous story about a passenger on missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 who supposedly hid his cell phone in his rectum and used it to post a picture to the Internet after the flight was hijacked), positing that Volkswagen has a terrific 300 MPG vehicle that only costs $60,000 all ready to go, but it can't be sold (or even seen) in America because politicians in the pay of oil companies are conspiring to keep it unknown and unsellable in the U.S.: 








You won't find the 300 MPG Volkswagen XL1 in an American showroom, in fact it has even been denied a tour of America because it is too efficient for the American public to be made widely aware of, and oil profits are too high in America with the status quo in place. No tour has been allowed for this car because the myth that 50 mpg is virtually impossible to obtain from even a stripped down econobox is too profitable to let go of, and when it comes to corporate oil profits, ignorance is bliss.
The answer is obvious. Simply for the sake of raking in huge profits from $4 a gallon gas, getting guzzled at 10X the rate it should be, the corporations have via campaign contributions and other types of pay outs succeeded in getting the FED to legislate the best cars off the road for irrelevant trumped up reasons. 
Even after being hand made with ""exotic"" materials in an intentionally limited edition, the Xl1 still only costs $60,000. There is a lot more of a market for this car than 2,000 units at that price, have no doubt, this car is being held back on purpose.


In this case the vehicle in question is the Volkswagen XL1, a two-person,  ""one-liter"" concept car (i.e., a vehicle capable of averaging 100 km per liter of fuel, or about 235 MPG) originally shown to the public back in 2002 and modified (and renamed) several times since over the intervening years.  The latest unveiled version of the XL1, already put into production, is a plug-in diesel-electric hybrid described thusly by Green Car Reports:


The Volkswagen XL1 is a plug-in diesel hybrid with a body seemingly beamed in from a future time.
It's the physical representation of the benefits of reducing weight and improving aerodynamics. The small body may only take two people, but it's allowed for an incredibly streamlined body with a drag coefficient of only 0.189.
Low weight -- only 1,752 lbs -- means only a small engine and electric motor is needed to deliver respectable performance. Much of the car is constructed from carbon fiber, aluminum and titanium.
VW says the car will do 261 mpg, though the real figure will be lower than that should it ever be tested under EPA guidelines. Even so, it'll still use comfortably less fuel than any vehicle currently on sale.
A diesel engine of only 0.8 liters and 2 cylinders capacity produces 47 horsepower, with a further 27 horses delivered by the electric motor. Power reaches the wheels via a 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox.
Those figures sound miniscule by modern standards, but the XL1 should reach 62 mph in 12.7 seconds. Top speed is 98 mph.
Operating alone, the small battery can deliver up to 31 miles of range, and can be charged via plug or regenerative effect.


It's true that very few, if any, Volkswagen XL1s will likely be seen on U.S. roads in the immediate future, but that situation will be due to a confluence of factors that does not include a government/Big Oil conspiracy to keep them out of the U.S.
First of all, it's not true that the XL1 has ""been denied a tour of America because
 it is too efficient for the American public to be made widely aware of.""  Existing safety and traffic regulations do limit where the current XL1 models can be legally driven in public roads in the U.S., but Volkswagen has taken at least three of the vehicles on tour around the U.S., and the staff of Jalopnik drove one around Manhattan at the end of 2013.
Second, the primary reason the XL1 won't be seen in the U.S. anytime soon is that Volkswagen is only producing 200 units for retail sale (not 2,000 as claimed above), all of them to be sold in Europe via some sort of selection (i.e., lottery) process.    
But why only 200 cars?  And why only in Europe? 






As for the first part, the answer is that new vehicles like the XL1 are expensive to develop and produce (and therefore expensive for consumers to afford), and similar forms of automobiles have not yet met with tremendous success on the commercial market, so any automotive company that puts such a model into full-blown production risks sinking a whole lot of money into something that may not sell well at all (especially in the U.S. market, where consumers have very different expectations and preferences than European car buyers do). The XL1 is in many ways still a concept/prototype vehicle, and so Volkswagen is testing the waters by putting out a limited production run to see how many consumers are really interested in shelling out the equivalent of U.S. $150,000 (not $60,000 as claimed above) for a two-person car.  And the testers at Car and Driver found that while the XL1's fuel efficiency might be superb, it might also be somewhat overblown as presented in promotional materials:


The XL1 should run 31 miles solely on electric power, says [VW development engineer Ulrich] Mitze. But on the cold and rainy April day we drove it, the small, 60-cell, 5.5-kWh, 150-pound lithium-ion battery pack needed a recharge after only 22 miles.
According to the on-board computer, we are fuel hogs. Having started with a full tank (2.6 gallons) and fully charged batteries, we ended our trip after 67 miles; fuel consumption plummeted at one point to a dismal 128 mpg. Achieving the XL1's theoretical 749-mile range would take a right foot as light as a moonbeam.


As for why only Europe, the answer is that the U.S. does have many safety standards in place (enacted many years ago a variety of reasons, none of which was to keep high-mileage vehicles off the U.S. market) that all automobile manufacturers have to meet in order to legally sell their vehicles in America, regulations that sometimes require manufacturers to modify or retrofit models that were produced for sale under less strict regulations in Europe (or other parts of the world).  If Volkswagen wants to test-market their XL1 in limited quantities, there's no reason for them to expend millions of dollars preparing and certifying those vehicles for U.S. safety standards when they can vend  their small lot of cars just as well in the European market without all the added expense.  As noted by USA Today:


The XL1 [is] a spaceship-like, ultra-high-mpg, plug-in diesel-electric hybrid. VW used exotic, but obtainable, materials and technologies to craft a mileage-above-all car able to get 261 mpg in European tests, equating, very roughly, to perhaps 200 mpg in U.S. tests.
Barely a real production model, it's made in a factory, but largely by hand. It couldn't meet U.S. safety rules and needed changes in German rules to be on the road there.


And if one buys into the conspiracy theory that the government and Big Oil are colluding to keep high-mileage vehicles off the U.S. market in order to protect profits from gasoline sales, one has to wonder why those powerful and malevolent entities aren't doing anything to stop Americans from purchasing cars produced by Tesla, superbly-performing vehicles that use no gasoline at all yet still deliver premium performance, have great range for electric cars, have received the highest rating of any automobile ever evaluated by Consumer Reports, are top-rated for safety even under tougher U.S. standards, but are widely available for purchase in the U.S.:


Most Americans may never actually see a Tesla Model S sedan in person, but you will want to know why this car is so important to the automotive industry and what all the media fuss is about.
Tesla Motors was founded in 2003 by a group of intrepid Silicon Valley engineers who set out to prove that electric vehicles could be awesome. The name of the company pays homage to Nicola Tesla, a Serbian American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, physicist, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.
As the California automaker's first production model, the Tesla Model S is 100 percent electric, a car so advanced it sets the new standard for premium performance. This is not a hybrid, nor is it equipped with any kind of ""range expanding"" gasoline engine. At the heart of the vehicle is the proven Tesla powertrain, delivering both unprecedented range and a thrilling drive experience. The Tesla Model S has won the 2013 Motor Trend Car of the Year award, received the highest rating of any automobile in history from Consumer Reports (99 out of 100) and achieved the best possible US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration rating.
Unlike the internal combustion engine with hundreds of moving pieces that spark, pump, belch, and groan, the Tesla motor has only one moving piece: the rotor. As a result, Model S acceleration is instantaneous, like flipping a switch. Hit the accelerator. In 5.4 seconds, Model S is traveling 60 miles per hour, without hesitation and without a drop of gasoline.


As in so many cases, what is attributed to furtive conspiracy is more easily explained away as wishful thinking colliding with the hard, cold realities of economics.

52.WasBarackObamaNamedi,"
In June 2017, a lawsuit filed by a man named Larry Klayman against President Barack Obama, George Soros, Black Lives Matter, Hillary Clinton, the Nation of Islam, and several others for inciting violence against police officers was dismissed.
In 2018, dubious ""news"" web sites such as Guerrilla.News continued to post about this lawsuit as if it was still recent, relevant, and ongoing:
FEDERAL LAWSUIT Names Obama, Holder, Sharpton, Farrakhan, BLM Leaders for ""INCITING VIOLENCE"" Against Police
It seems as though Former President Barack Obama may have some regrets after supporting Black Lives Matter. He was so adamant about pushing the cop-hating and white-hating mentality that was the catalyst in further dividing Americans, but now it seems to all have backfired. A conservative activist is in the process of holding Obama and his black extremist peers responsible for the hate that they have built through their idiotic persistence.
Former prosecutor Larry Klayman is sick and tired of the cop-killing and extreme animosity towards police. He recently filed a lawsuit against a group of defendants that he believes are responsible for instigating the hateful crime spree.
This lawsuit was filed by Larry Klayman in July 2016 in the United States District Court of the Northern District of Texas on behalf of himself and Dallas Police Sargent Demetrick Pennie, shortly after five police officers were killed by a sniper. 
The lawsuit accused Obama and 16 other defendants of inciting ""their supporters and others to engage in threats of and attacks to cause serious bodily injury or death upon police officers and other law enforcement persons of all races and ethnicity including but not limited to Jews, Christians and Caucasians.""  It was dismissed in June 2017:
With respect to Defendants President Obama and General Holder, the court grants their Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 21), as Plaintiffs lack Article III standing, and accordingly dismisses without prejudice Count Three for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). Counts One and Two are dismissed without prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(A)(i), as Plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed these claims against President Obama and General Holder, and no answer or motion for summary judgment has been filed by either Defendant. 






Klayman has a long history of filing frivolous lawsuits. In fact, during the back-and-fourth litigation of the aforementioned lawsuit, the court warned Klayman about filing more ""nonsensical documents"" and threatened him with a fine:
ORDER: The record reflects Mr. Klayman's predilection for filing frivolous, nonsensical, and vituperative documents, in the form of notices, motions, briefs, etc., in response to unfavorable rulings. The court has grown weary of Mr. Klayman's tactics. If Mr. Klayman files any further frivolous or nonsensical documents in this matter, the court will personally sanction him monetarily. The court directs the Clerk to strike ""Plaintiffs' Response to the Court's Order Denying Motion for Leave to File Notice of New Case Authority Re: Memorandum Opinion and Order in Nwanguma v. Trump""(Doc. 132 ). (Ordered by Judge Sam A Lindsay on 4/13/2017) (axm) (Entered: 04/14/2017)
It appears that Klayman escaped discipline during the course of these legal proceedings, but the conservative attorney has not always been so lucky. In a 2017 profile of the conservative attorney, TheHill.com noted that Klayman has been formally disciplined by multiple courts:
In a 2016 opinion, a federal court of appeals noted 12 cases ""in which Klayman's ability to practice law in an ethical and orderly manner was called into question.""
Klayman, an avid supporter of the ""birther"" conspiracy theory, also once filed a petition to get Obama deported. Klayman has also referred to Obama as a ""Muslim king"" and once held a ""citizen's grand jury"" (which had no legal authority) in an attempt to charge Obama with fraud for becoming president. The activist lawyer's documents have no force of law and compel no government action, serving instead as self-published expressions of his political viewpoint.

35.VladimirPutinendedtheRothschildscontroloverRussiabynationalizingtheRussiancentralizedbank,"
Russia's ongoing attack on Ukraine has given new life to a false claim first shared on social media in 2018.
The Facebook post from March 14, 2018, shows a portrait of Russian President Vladimir Putin seated in a chair, along with a caption that reads, ""Just in case you're wondering why they hate him."" Text in the image credits Putin with a few things, including that he ""ended the Rothschild's control over Russia by nationalizing the Russian centralized bank.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Contrary to the claim, Putin was not responsible for the nationalization of the Russian centralized bank, which took place in 1917, according to the Bank of Russia.
And evidence does not support the claim that the Rothschild family or its companies ever had control over Russia. The family's banking business has had an office in Russia since the 1990s -- though it recently suspended operations -- but it has no oversight over the country's currency or monetary policies, which are controlled by the Bank of Russia.
The Rothschild family has long been the target of conspiracy theories, and their wealth is believed to have inspired the anti-Semitic trope that Jewish people ""control"" the world's money.
The entity now known as the Bank of Russia was founded in 1860, and in 1917, ""after a decree was adopted ... about the nationalization of banks, a state monopoly on banking was announced,"" according to the bank's website. The bank is the sole issuer of currency in Russia and sets the country's monetary policies.

Our ruling
A Facebook post says Putin ""ended the Rothschild's control over Russia by nationalizing the Russian centralized bank.""
Putin did not nationalize the Russian centralized bank; that occurred in 1917.

The Facebook post says FEMA is associated with specific executive orders which would allow the agency to ""suspend the Constitution and the Bill of Rights,"" and lists the numbers of 15 executive orders.
PolitiFact reported in 2014 on 14 of the same executive orders, which ""allegedly usurp traditional executive powers, including things like seizing control of the media, railroads, waterways and correctional institutions."" In reality, though, those order numbers matched up with executive orders on either entirely different topics or orders that were much more limited in scope.
The executive orders in question originated in 1962, Popular Mechanics reported, when the U.S. was involved in conflicts in both Cuba and Vietnam and the prospect of a Cold War with the Soviet Union loomed. So ""President John F. Kennedy signed a series of executive orders that outlined the basic framework for agency responsibilities during a national emergency.""
And rather than allowing the suspension of citizens' rights, ""safeguards were written into the current framework of responsibilities, declaring that any emergency preparation or actions 'shall be consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,'"" according to the 2014 article in Popular Mechanics.
Almost all of the executive orders have since been revoked.
The Facebook post also includes details about where the purported 800 prison camps are located, including Fort Chaffee in Arkansas and Camp Grayling in Michigan. But evidence does not corroborate those claims.
For example, the post says that Fort Chaffee ""has new runway for aircraft, new camp facility with cap of 40,000 prisoners."" That same claim was debunked in a 2010 report called ""Fear of FEMA"" from the Southern Poverty Law Center, and there's no evidence that anything has changed since.

25.DebunkingTrumpTweets,"
On Nov. 29, 2020, President Donald Trump retweeted a claim that #TeamKraken (the nickname for persons seeking to overturn Trump's election loss to Joe Biden) had won ""a major injunction"" in Georgia (a state Trump lost to Biden by about 13,000 votes) resulting in ""an order to freeze all [voting] machines"" there:

GREAT NEWS! Is Fake News @60Minutes watching this? https://t.co/v9T2MUmGss
-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2020

#TeamKraken had filed a lawsuit a few days earlier seeking, among other things, to force Georgia officials to de-certify the election results, to enjoin them from transmitting the already-certified vote results to the Electoral College, to order the governor to declare Donald Trump the winner of the election, and to require that all voting machines be ""seized and impounded immediately for a forensic audit.""
The big win for #TeamKraken had supposedly been the issuance of an order enjoining the State of Georgia from ""wiping or resetting any voting machines in the [state] until further order of the Court"":

Emergency Order just entered by Judge Timothy C. Batten, Sr.:
""Defendants are ordered to maintain the statue quo & are temporarily enjoined from wiping or resetting any voting machines in the State of Georgia until further order of the Court.""
Stop the steal NOW @BrianKempGA.
-- Lin Wood (@LLinWood) November 29, 2020 







That alleged victory, such at it was, proved to be short-lived, however:

What??? Judge reversed order based on Defendants' claim that GA Counties control voting machines.
Machines are owned by State & @GaSecofState administers state laws on elections. 
Why are GA officials determined to wipe these machines clean be resetting them? https://t.co/Oq0edTGfsl
-- Lin Wood (@LLinWood) November 29, 2020
 
U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Batten initially granted a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) requiring the State of Georgia ""to impound and preserve the voting machines in the State of Georgia, and to prevent any wiping of data.""  However, shortly afterwards Batten reversed himself and denied the request for a TRO because the voting machines in question are not under the control of the defendants in the case (i.e., Georgia state officials), but rather under the control of Georgia county officials (who were not named in the lawsuit):

Plaintiffs contend that Union County officials have advised that they are going to wipe or reset the voting machines of all data and bring the count back to zero on Monday, November 30. On this basis, Plaintiffs seek a temporary restraining order to impound and preserve the voting machines in the State of Georgia, and to prevent any wiping of data. However, Plaintiffs' request fails because the voting equipment that they seek to impound is in the possession of county election officials. Any injunction the Court issues would extend only to Defendants and those within their control, and Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that county election officials are within Defendants' control. Defendants cannot serve as a proxy for local election officials against whom the relief should be sought. Therefore, to the extent Plaintiffs seek emergency relief to impound and preserve the voting machines, that request is denied.

Whether or not the voting machines in Georgia are impounded and/or wiped, the end result is unlikely to be of any import.  The state certified its vote after performing a statewide Risk-Limiting Audit of all votes cast which ""upheld and reaffirmed the original outcome produced by the machine tally of votes cast,"" and claims by #TeamKraken that machines manufactured by Dominion Voting Systems were part of a massive voting fraud conspiracy which deprived Trump of a lawful victory were contradicted by Dominion spokesman Michael Steel, who explained that the alleged switching of votes from Trump to Biden could not have occurred because it was ""physically impossible"":

""Well, it's physically impossible,"" Steel said of vote switching. ""Look, when a voter votes on a Dominion machine, they fill out a ballot on a touch screen. They are given a printed copy which they then give to a local election official for safekeeping. If any electronic interference had taken place, the tally reported electronically would not match the printed ballots. and in every case where we've looked at -- in Georgia, all across the country -- the printed ballot, the gold standard in election security, has matched the electronic tally.""
""We simply provide a tool to count the ballots -- to print and count ballots,"" he said. ""There is no way such a massive fraud could have taken place, and there are no connections between our company and Venezuela, Germany, Barcelona, Kathmandu, whatever the latest conspiracy theory is.""

155.LeakedEmailShowsClin,"
On 7 October 2016, various conspiracy theory web sites posted articles alleging that a hacked e-mail from the personal account of a former Hillary Clinton employee at the U.S. State Department, Capricia Penavic Marshall, suggested ""some level of collusion"" between the Clintons, HBO, and British-born comedian and television host John Oliver:

As presenter of the popular HBO show Last Week Tonight, Oliver has made a name for himself with a series of anti-Donald Trump monologues, including one that made global headlines when he revealed that the Trump family name was once changed from the ancestral name ""Drumpf"".
The email was sent on February 19, 2015 by Greg Propper, an advisor to The Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. Its recipients included Sarah Henning, Director of Programs at the Clinton Foundation, and Capricia Marshal, who served as served as chief of protocol from 2009 to 2013 under Secretary Clinton at the State Department.
The email, which was sent to Henning's 'clintonfoundation.org' address, is entitled, ""We've made contact with John Olivier"" and the body of the email reads, ""And his team is working on it. Hope to have an answer tomorrow.""

While acknowledging that the spelling of Oliver's name is off by one character -- ""We've made contact with John Olivier,"" the e-mail reads -- InfoWars goes on to claim that ""the context makes it clear that the email is in reference to the comedian."" That's patently false, however, considering that the entire message consists of 20 words:

We are unable to explain why InfoWars wanted to convince us that the e-mail provides enough context to conclude that ""John Olivier"" is ""John Oliver"" -- unless it's because they don't want us poking around and finding out there are more e-mails in the exchange that not only establish the context, but also prove that the Clinton associates reached out to Oliver for a perfectly above-board reason: to invite him to make a guest appearance at a March 9, 2015 event being planned in conjunction with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 






In fact, Oliver was but one of a long list of celebrities under consideration:

Apropos of John Oliver, the idea was apparently to have him open the show with a short comedy sketch. From the looks of it, they were trying to get singer John Legend to entertain, as well:

Neither Oliver nor Legend ended up performing in the show. We scanned the leaked e-mails for further evidence of conspiracy, but found none -- unless you count the idea of staging a surprise truce between ""feuding"" pop stars Katy Perry and Taylor Swift, an event that (like Oliver's appearance) also never came to pass.

162.TimelineTheTrumpimpe,"
Last updated with new events Feb. 6.
It started with an international phone call. It ended with the Senate voting to acquit President Donald Trump of charges that he abused his power and obstructed Congress, wrapping up the third presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history.
The House's articles of impeachment followed months of investigation after a whistleblower's complaint sounded alarms about the president's efforts to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and a debunked conspiracy related to the 2016 election. 
The articles charged that Trump held up security assistance and a White House meeting to put pressure on Zelensky, then obstructed Congress to cover up that campaign.
This timeline documents the events that set the stage for Trump's call with Zelensky and what's happened in the months since.
The sources are either verified events, court filings, public statements or on-the-record reports.
Winter 2013-14: A popular revolution begins in Ukraine after its president tries to strengthen ties with Russia. Vice President Joe Biden assumes a lead role in U.S. diplomacy there. 
Feb. 21, 2014: Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych goes into exile in Russia.
April 18, 2014: Hunter Biden, 44, son of Joe Biden, joins the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company. Biden's directorship attracts attention because Burisma is owned by Mykola Zlochevsky, a minister under Yanukovych. Zlochevsky and subsidiaries of Burisma had faced accusations of money laundering, fraud and tax evasion. (Zlochevsky and the company have denied the allegations.)

Feb. 10, 2015: Ukraine appoints Viktor Shokin as prosecutor general. Shokin inherits some of the investigations into Zlochevsky and his company. But Vitaliy Kasko, who serves as Shokin's deputy overseeing international cooperation until he resigns in protest, later tells Bloomberg in 2019 that, under Shokin, the investigation into Burisma remained dormant. Kasko says the matter was ""shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015,"" and Bloomberg reports that documents back up his account.
Winter 2015-16: Many Western leaders and institutions, as well as Ukrainian anti-corruption activists, view Shokin as corrupt and ineffective for failing to prosecute anybody of significance and for protecting members of Yanukovych's and Poroshenko's circles. Biden threatens to withhold $1 billion unless Shokin is fired. (He later brags that his pressure tactics succeeded.)
March 29, 2016: Shokin is sacked by Ukraine's parliament.
May 12, 2016: Yuri Lutsenko succeeds Shokin as Ukraine's prosecutor general.
Jan. 2017: Burisma announces that all open legal cases against Zlochevsky and Burisma companies are ""fully closed.""

Jan. 23, 2018: In videotaped remarks, former Vice President Biden boasts that his threat to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid to Ukraine unless Shokin was fired was successful. He says:
""I remember going over (to Ukraine), convincing our team ... that we should be providing for loan guarantees ... And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from (then Ukrainian President Petro) Poroshenko and from (then-Prime Minister Arseniy) Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor (Shokin). And they didn't. ...
""They were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, ... we're not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, 'You have no authority. You're not the president.' ... I said, call him. I said, I'm telling you, you're not getting the billion dollars. I said, you're not getting the billion. ... I looked at them and said, 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.' Well, son of a b----. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.""
Jan. 23, 2019: Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, participates in a conference call with Shokin and Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two Ukrainian business associates of Giuliani, according to the House Intelligence Committee's Dec. 3 impeachment report. Notes of the call show Shokin making allegations about Biden, Burisma and Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.
Jan. 25, 2019: Over the course of two days, Giuliani meets with Lutsenko, Parnas and Fruman in New York, according to the House Intelligence Committee's report.
March 20, 2019: Journalist John Solomon, then an opinion contributor at The Hill, publishes a column promoting unsupported allegations about Yovanovitch based on an interview with Lutsenko. Lutsenko later walks back his claims.
The article is part of a series of columns that give false credence to unproven conspiracies related to Yovanovitch, Biden and alleged Ukrainian election interference in 2016. 
Solomon goes on Fox News host Sean Hannity's primetime TV show at night to promote the article. Less than two hours later, Trump tweets about the segment.
March 22, 2019: Giuliani tweets about ""some real collusion between Hillary, Kerry and Biden people colluding with Ukrainian operatives to make money and affect 2016 election.""
March 24, 2019: Donald Trump Jr., Trump's oldest son, tweets an article promoting the allegations against Yovanovitch from Solomon's articles. He calls her a ""joker.""

March 29, 2019: Giuliani speaks with Pompeo a second time, according to State Department emails.

April 25, 2019: Biden announces his 2020 run for presidency.
April 25, 2019: On Fox News, Trump suggests that Ukraine interfered in 2016. ""I would imagine (Barr) would want to see this,"" he says. ""People have been saying this whole -- the concept of Ukraine, they have been talking about it actually for a long time.""
Spring 2019: Hunter Biden leaves Burisma. There are conflicting reports as to whether the younger Biden's departure occurred before or after the elder Biden announced his presidential run. (Biden's campaign, Hunter Biden's attorney, Burisma Holdings and a lawyer for the company did not respond to multiple requests for the date of Hunter Biden's departure.)
May 10, 2019: Giuliani cancels a trip he had planned to Ukraine, during which he was to meet with Zelensky.
May 16, 2019: Lutsenko, Ukraine's prosecutor general, tells Bloomberg there's no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens in Ukraine: ""Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws -- at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing.""
May 19, 2019: On Fox News, Trump claims Biden pushed for Shokin's ouster to protect his son. This claim is inconsistent with statements from Lutsenko and other former Ukrainian prosecutors and anti-corruption activists.
""The prosecutor was after (Biden's) son,"" Trump says. ""Then he said, 'If you fire the prosecutor, you'll be okay. And if you don't fire the prosecutor, 'We're not giving you $2 billion in loan guarantees,' or whatever he was supposed to give. Can you imagine if I did that?""
May 20, 2019: Yovanovitch leaves her post as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. She later tells Congress in closed-door testimony that the State Department recalled her ""under pressure from the president."" Zelensky is inaugurated.

Col. Alexander Vindman, director for European affairs at the National Security Council. Sondland, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Kurt Volker, then the U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, are at the meeting. At one point, Sondland ""speak(s) about Ukraine delivering specific investigations in order to secure"" a White House meeting, Vindman later testifies.
July 12, 2019: White House aide Robert Blair sends an email to Michael Duffey, a Trump-appointed OMB official, indicating that ""the president is directing a hold on military support funding for Ukraine,"" according to Sandy's testimony.

July 25, 2019: Volker texts Andriy Yermak, a top Ukrainian official and aide to Zelensky. ""Heard from White House,"" Volker writes. ""Assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / 'get to the bottom of what happened' in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington.""

July 25, 2019: The White House Office of Management and Budget officially implements the hold on aid to Ukraine through footnotes in a series of funding documents, according to Sandy's testimony. 
A line in the first document's footnotes say the Pentagon cannot spend the money until Aug. 5. A second line in the footnote says the ""brief pause in obligations"" will not prevent the Pentagon from disbursing the funds before they are set to expire at the end of the fiscal year.
Sandy later testifies that this line was meant to get ""to the heart of that issue about ensuring that we don't run afoul of the Impoundment Control Act,"" a Nixon-era law that limits the president's ability to delay congressionally appropriated funds.
July 25, 2019: The State Department sends two emails indicating that Ukrainian officials are aware that U.S. aid to Ukraine had been frozen, according to Pentagon official Laura Cooper's testimony.
July 26, 2019: Sondland and Volker meet with Zelensky in Ukraine, per the whistleblower complaint and Zelensky's website.

Trump asks if Zelensky is going to do the investigations. Sondland says yes.
July 29, 2019: Duffey tells Sandy that he will handle the funding documents controlling the aid going forward. In subsequent documents, Duffey continues to push back the aid's scheduled release date, according to Sandy's testimony and the House Intelligence Committee's report.
Aug. 9, 2019: Sondland and Volker text about a statement Ukraine might be asked to put out about the investigations. Sondland says Trump ""really wants the deliverable."" Sondland and Volker ask Giuliani what the statement should say.

Sept. 1, 2019: Vice President Mike Pence meets with Zelensky in Warsaw, Poland. Zelensky raises the fact that U.S. assistance had been frozen, according to testimony from Timothy Morrison, then the top Russia expert on the NSC.

Following this meeting, Sondland pulls Yermak aside and tells him that the hold would not be lifted until there was an announcement of investigations into Burisma and the 2016 election, according to testimony from several witnesses.
Sept. 1, 2019: William Taylor, the top American diplomat in Ukraine, texts with Volker and Sondland about the administration's handling of U.S. aid to Ukraine.

""Call me,"" Sondland replies.
Sept. 4, 2019: In a witness statement, the ousted Ukrainian prosecutor Shokin claims he was forced out because he was investigating Burisma. Shokin's claim is inconsistent with statements from other former Ukrainian prosecutors and anti-corruption activists.

Sept 9, 2019: Michael Atkinson, inspector general of the intelligence community, notifies Rep.

Sept. 23, 2019: Seven freshman House Democrats with national security backgrounds publish a Washington Post op-ed that calls on fellow lawmakers to consider impeachment hearings after reports that Trump may have pressured Ukraine into investigating Biden. The authors write, ""If these allegations are true, we believe these actions represent an impeachable offense.""

Sept. 26, 2019: The whistleblower complaint is made public. It largely reflects the substance of the Trump-Zelensky call.

It further alleges that other discussions between Trump and world leaders were similarly secured.

Volker tells Congress he told Giuliani the narrative about Biden was ""not credible,"" that Giuliani had advocated for the July 25 phone call and that Trump once complained that Ukraine ""tried to take me down"" in the 2016 election.
Volker says Giuliani insisted that a proposed Zelesky statement in exchange for a White House meeting should include explicit references to ""Burisma and 2016."" Volker says the statement ""died"" because Ukraine didn't want to follow through with those references.

Oct. 11, 2019: Michael McKinley, a former senior adviser to Pompeo, resigns. He later tells Congress that his decision was in part because he felt ""disturbed by the implication that foreign governments were being approached to procure negative information on political opponents,"" according to the Washington Post.
Oct. 11, 2019: Yovanovitch testifies before Congress. In prepared remarks, she says the State Department recalled her in May ""under pressure from the president"" and that she was wrongly accused by Giuliani of disparaging Trump.
She also says she felt ""threatened"" by Trump based on his pledge to Zelensky that ""she's going to go through some things."" She says she learned in late 2018 that Giuliani had been meeting with Lutsenko about her. 
Yovanovitch says Sondland told her that if she wanted to save her job, she should tweet out support for Trump, and that the State Department would not issue a statement supporting her out of ""caution"" that it would be ""undermined"" by Trump.
Oct: 14, 2019: Fiona Hill, the White House's former top Russia expert, testifies in Congress. She tells Congress there was ""no merit"" to the accusations against Yovanovitch. 
She also says Bolton described Giuliani as ""a hand grenade that is going to blow everybody up"" and called the conditioning of a White House meeting on political investigations a ""drug deal.""
Oct. 15, 2019: Hunter Biden sits for an interview with ABC's Amy Robach. He says he ""did nothing wrong at all"" and that he never discussed his work for Burisma at length with his father.
Oct. 15, 2019: George Kent, a senior State Department official in charge of Ukraine policy, testifies that he was left out of decisions about the country and describes his interactions with officials who observed efforts by the administration to pressure Ukraine.

Oct. 15, 2019: A federal grand jury subpoenas former Rep. Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican, for documents related to his dealings with Giuliani and his Ukrainian associates. A spokesman for Sessions tweets that Sessions is cooperating and providing the requested documents.
Oct. 17, 2019: Sondland testifies that Trump directed administration officials to involve Giuliani in discussions about Ukraine. He says he realized only later that ""Giuliani's agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the President's 2020 reelection campaign.""
He says the pressure on Ukraine started with corruption but ""kept getting more insidious as (the) timeline went on."" He says the State Department was ""fully aware of the issues"" with Giuliani but was helpless to challenge Trump. He also says the investigations were ""conditions (that) would have to be complied with prior to getting a meeting"" and that he ""could not get a straight answer"" on why the aid was frozen.
Sondland later revises his testimony to clarify that he had told Ukraine ""that resumption of the U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks.""
Oct. 17, 2019: Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney says in a press briefing that the Trump administration froze military aid to leverage Ukraine into investigating a conspiracy theory related to the 2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee server.

Oct. 22, 2019: Taylor testifies that the Trump administration sought to withhold aid from Ukraine and deny Zelensky a White House meeting unless he launched the desired investigations. 
In prepared remarks, Taylor says Sondland, Volker, Giuliani and Perry were leading ""an irregular, informal channel"" of policymaking with respect to Ukraine. He says Sondland told him ""everything"" was ""dependent on a public announcement of investigations from Zelensky,"" and that Zelensky planned to make such an announcement on CNN to avoid a ""stalemate.""
In his closed-door interview, Taylor tells Congress it was his ""clear understanding"" that the aid would not be released unless Zelensky announced these investigations, and he says Giuliani was the likely mastermind behind that arrangement.
Oct: 23, 2019: Cooper, a Pentagon official, testifies before Congress after delays caused by protesting Republicans trying to storm the room.
Cooper says the Department of Defense determined in May that Ukraine had met the Pentagon's anti-corruption requirements to receive security assistance. She says the ""funds were held without explanation."" 
She also says that conversations with Volker led her to make ""a very strong inference that there was some knowledge on the part of the Ukrainians"" about the freeze on aid.
Oct: 23, 2019: Parnas and Fruman plead not guilty in court.
Oct. 24, 2019: Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., introduces a resolution condemning the impeachment inquiry. The resolution claims the inquiry is ""denying President Trump basic fairness and due process accorded every American,"" a statement we rated False.
Oct. 26, 2019: McKinley testifies in Congress that he resigned in part because he became aware of ""missions to procure negative political information for domestic purposes"" and in part because he was frustrated by Yovanovitch's removal from Ukraine. He says he requested that the State Department publicly defend Yovanovitch, but that Pompeo brushed off his concerns.
Oct. 26, 2019: Philip Reeker, acting assistant secretary at the State Department's Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, testifies behind closed doors. He says he tried to get the State Department to issue a ""robust"" statement backing Yovanovitch.
Reeker says Yovanovitch had an ""outstanding"" reputation but faced ""really outrageous press coverage and innuendo and threats coming from high levels, retweeting irresponsible journalism, which affected her personally, her safety, affected our mission, reflected on the United States.""
He also says ""there was an understanding"" that Giuliani was ""feeding the president a lot of very negative views about Ukraine.""
Oct. 28, 2019: Pelosi announces that the House will vote on a resolution to affirm the ongoing investigation and lay out procedures for public hearings.
Oct. 29, 2019: Vindman, the director for European affairs at the National Security Council, testifies that he listened in on the July 25 phone call from the White House Situation Room and raised concerns about it with the NSC's lead counsel. He says he previously reported concerns following the July 10 meeting between Danylyuk and Bolton, Volker, Sondland and Perry. 
Answering questions from Congress, Vindman says Mulvaney ""coordinated"" a plan to condition a White House meeting on the investigation into the Bidens. 
He also says ""there were a couple of things that were not included"" in the readout of the July 25 phone call, such as a mention by Trump of ""recordings."" Vindman says that in one case, when Zelensky is quoted as saying ""the company,"" he really said ""to Burisma that you mentioned.""
Oct. 30, 2019: State Department official Christopher Anderson, who worked under Volker as an expert on Ukraine until July 12, testifies in Congress that Bolton once said Giuliani ""could be an obstacle to increased White House engagement.""

Oct. 30, 2019: State Department official Catherine Croft, who took over Anderson's role under Volker and previously worked for the National Security Council, testifies. She says that during her time with the NSC, she received multiple calls from a Republican lobbyist saying Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, should be fired. Croft also says she was told that Mulvaney held up aid to Ukraine at Trump's ""direction.""
In her interview behind closed doors, she says two Ukrainian embassy officials reached out to her to ask about the hold on military aid before it became public. She says they ""found out very early on or much earlier than I expected them to.""
Oct. 30, 2019: Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, Trump's nominee to become the U.S. ambassador to Russia, testifies during his Senate confirmation hearing that Giuliani was part of a ""campaign against"" Yovanovitch.

Morrison witnessed the conversation occur and briefed Bolton, Taylor and the NSC lawyers about it.
Morrison also says he listened to the July 25 call and was not concerned that anything illegal had been discussed. But he advised NSC lawyers afterward to review and restrict access to the call's written record because it would be ""damaging"" if ""its contents leaked.""

Nov. 6, 2019: David Hale, the State Department's third-ranking official, testifies privately. He says the allegations Giuliani was pushing about Yovanovitch seemed like ""a roundabout way the president was trying to get rid of the ambassador through this smear campaign.""

Nov. 6, 2019: The House Intelligence committee releases the transcript of Taylor's closed-door deposition.

She says she listened in on the July 25 call and felt Trump's mention of specific investigations was ""unusual and inappropriate"" and ""shed some light on possible other motivations behind a security assistance hold."" She says her handwritten notes reflect that Zelensky said ""Burisma"" on the call, even as the call readout does not show him specifically naming the company.
Nov. 7, 2019: Lawyers for the whistleblower send a cease-and-desist letter urging Trump to stop calling for the public disclosure of the whistleblower's identity.

Nov. 13, 2019: The House Intelligence Committee leads its first public hearing with testimony from Kent and Taylor, who reaffirm what they said in private testimony.
Kent affirms that Russia -- not Ukraine -- interfered in the 2016 election. He says that Biden's pressure to remove Shokin was not equivalent to Trump's actions on Ukraine, and that Yovanovitch did not deserve to be recalled.
Taylor testifies that Trump wanted Zelensky in a ""public box,"" that Zelensky did not want to play a role in U.S. domestic politics, that Trump believed he had been ""wronged"" by the Ukrainians and was ""owed"" the investigations in return, and that conditioning aid for political purposes was not normal and not something he had seen before.
In a new revelation, Taylor also says Holmes, his staffer at the embassy in Ukraine, had told him since his private deposition about the phone call between Sondland and Trump that occurred July 26, while Sondland and Holmes were at a restaurant in Kiev.
Nov. 15, 2019: Yovanovitch testifies publicly. Her comments largely match what she said behind closed doors. She denies unsupported allegations pushed by Giuliani, Lutsenko, Solomon and others that she bad-mouthed Trump or gave Lutsenko a do-not-prosecute list.
While Yovanovitch is testifying, Trump tweets that ""everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,"" a claim PolitiFact rated Pants on Fire. Yovanovitch says Trump's tweet is ""very intimidating.""
Nov. 15, 2019: Holmes, the U.S. embassy official in Ukraine, testifies behind closed doors after being mentioned in Taylor's public testimony.
He describes how he overheard a phone conversation between Trump and Sondland while at a restaurant with Sondland in Ukraine. He says he reported the conversation to embassy officials and repeatedly referred back to it afterward.
Holmes testifies that he heard Sondland tell Trump that Zelensky ""loves your ass."" Trump asked Sondland if Zelensky was ""going to do the investigation,"" and Sondland replied that ""he's going to do it,"" Holmes says. 
Holmes says that when he later asked Sondland what Trump thought about Ukraine, Sondland told him Trump ""does not give a s--- about Ukraine"" and only cares about ""big stuff that benefits"" him like the ""Biden investigation.""
Nov. 16, 2019: Sandy, the career OMB official, testifies behind closed doors. He describes how the OMB implemented the hold on aid through footnotes in a series of funding documents sent to the Defense Department.
Sandy says the language in the footnotes was crafted to alleviate concerns among officials that the agency could be running afoul of the 1974 Impoundment Control Act. Sandy says Duffey, the Trump-appointed OMB official, altered the footnotes' language as time went on and continued delaying the scheduled release date for the aid with each document he sent out.
Sandy says two OMB officials resigned around this time. He also says that by the start of the new fiscal year on October 1, roughly $35 million in assistance for Ukraine remained unspent.

Nov. 19, 2019: Vindman and Williams testify publicly, followed by Volker and Morrison. Their testimonies largely reflect what they told Congress in private.
Vindman and Williams both testify that they were alarmed by the July 25 phone call after listening in. Volker says he ""was never involved with anything that I considered to be bribery at all,"" and Morrison testifies that he saw no problems with the July 25 call.
Volker vouches for Biden's character, and Morrison testifies that Trump had indicated that Zelensky ""had to make the statement"" about pursuing an investigation into Burisma.
Volker also says that he did not understand until recently that an investigation of Burisma was akin to an investigation of the Bidens. He says that if he had pieced that together, he would've raised objections. He says he ""did not know of a linkage"" to military aid.
Volker acknowledges the July 10 White House meeting, which he had left out of his private testimony. He says Sondland's mention of investigations in the meeting was ""inappropriate.""
Vindman and Williams both say they know of no national security officials who were supportive of the decision to freeze military aid to Ukraine.
Nov. 20, 2019: Sondland testifies publicly that ""everybody was in the loop"" and that he ""came to believe that the resumption of security aid would not occur until there was a public statement from Ukraine committing to the investigations of the 2016 election and Burisma.""
He says: ""I know that members of this committee have frequently framed these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a 'quid pro quo?' As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes.""
Sondland also says he, Volker and Perry worked with Giuliani ""at the express direction of the president of the United States."" He says that when he called Trump on Sept. 9 to ask what the president wanted with regard to Ukraine, Trump said he wanted ""no quid pro quo.""

Nov. 20, 2019: Trump speaks to reporters on the White House lawn while Sondland is testifying. He does not take questions.

Nov. 20, 2019: Cooper and Hale testify publicly, repeating what they said behind closed doors.
Hale says the allegations that led to Yovanovitch's removal were ""wrong"" and that she ""should have been able to stay in post and continue to do the outstanding work that she was doing.""
Cooper says the Defense Department certified Ukraine for meeting the anti-corruption requirements necessary to receive security assistance in May. 
In a new revelation, Cooper testifies that her staff presented her with two State Department emails indicating that Ukrainian officials were aware that there was an issue with the aid by July 25. She says they were aware it had been suspended as early as August.
Nov. 20, 2019: The Daily Beast reports that Parnas helped arrange meetings and calls in Europe for Nunes in 2018, according to Parnas' attorney.
Nov. 21, 2019: Holmes and Hill testify publicly. Holmes recalls the July 26 phone call he overheard between Sondland and Trump. He also says the embassy's work was ""overshadowed by a political agenda"" promoted by Giuliani and others ""with a direct channel to the White House.""
Hill pushes back against the ""fictional narrative"" that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election. 
""Some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country -- and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did,"" she says. ""This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.""
Nov. 21, 2019: Graham sends a letter to Pompeo requesting documents related to Biden and his contacts with Ukrainian officials.

""In my capacity as personal counsel to President Trump and with his knowledge and consent, I request a meeting with you on this upcoming Monday, May 13th or Tuesday, May 14th,"" Giuliani wrote. ""I will need no more than a half-hour of your time.""

Parnas also says Barr was ""basically on the team."" And Parnas says he was surprised to see Nunes involved in the House's hearings because he was ""involved in getting all this stuff.""

80.WasJournalistJenMoor,"
The death of Jen Moore in Maryland in August 2018 reignited conspiracy bloggers' claims of a long-running and far-ranging plot to kill off critics of Bill and Hillary Clinton, with suggestions that the ""investigative journalist's"" recent death was a suspicious one that coincided with her providing criminal allegations about Bill Clinton to federal authorities.
In this case, the claim was also promoted using a photograph of a different person:

Police in Prince George's County, Maryland, confirmed to us that Jen Moore died on 13 August 2018, but they noted that the cause of her death had not yet been determined. Nonetheless, conspiracy sites asserted that Moore ""died of an apparent seizure,"" citing non-specific ""preliminary reports"" from police:
Investigative Journalist Jen Moore was found dead in a suburban Washington D.C. hotel room, according to police and shocked and distraught friends and colleagues.
Moore died of an apparent seizure. Police are closely investigating the cause of death in Prince George's County, Maryland. Preliminary reports from police said the death was not the result of suicide.
Moore's body was found by employees at the Country Inn & Suites by Radisson, Washington, D.C. East - in Capitol Heights, Maryland. The investigation is ongoing. An autopsy had not been scheduled as of late Monday. 






Prince George's County police spokesperson Cpl. Lamar Robinson told us that local authorities do not believe Moore's death came under suspicious circumstances.
Moore (whose identification as an ""investigative journalist"" apparently stems from her activity posting conspiracy theory videos to YouTube under the screen name ""Task Force"") supposedly died just after contacting officials at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with information she gleaned from interviewing a 26-year-old man -- a man who allegedly claimed that former president Bill Clinton had sexually assaulted him, and that he had been ""pimped out"" to private events held by ""elites"" in Washington D.C. (Various blogs contradictorily claimed that Moore died either either one week or four weeks after supposedly contacting federal investigators.)
Whether Moore actually interviewed a subject who made such allegations, and whether Moore in fact reported those allegations to the DHS and FBI shortly before her death remains unconfirmed. The claims that she did stem primarily from an article published TruePundit.com, an unreliable conspiracy-driven website that has a long history of claiming possession of exclusive FBI information, and that publishes pseudonymously-bylined articles while providing no contact information.
Several blog posts also included screen captures of text messages purportedly sent by Moore saying that she thought that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was the ""best place to go"" with her allegations because ""the top FBI are blackmailed or involved."" According to Moore, President Donald Trump had ordered ICE's homeland security investigations unit to focus on arresting child traffickers, and because of that, she said, ""the Dems and some [Republicans] are trying to disband"" the agency.
In fact, the push to abolish ICE has been credited to a liberal activist, Sean McElwee, after he first used the term on Twitter in February 2017. In June 2018, 19 special agents from that agency asked Homeland Security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to spin them off into their own agency in order to avoid their being associated with deportation efforts that have led to public criticism of ICE.
Homeland Security officials did not respond to our request for comment. An FBI spokesperson told us via email that, per bureau policy, they could not confirm whether they had or had not been contacted by Moore.

309.ThismanfundsANTIFAHeisarealNAZIHisnameisGeorgeSoros,"
A subset of misinformation about demonstrations that erupted across the United States in the wake of George Floyd's death involve billionaire Democratic donor George Soros. We've debunked claims that Soros is leaving rocks for activists to cause damage in Los Angeles, among other cities. He isn't providing ""Soros Riot Dance Squad"" buses to ferry people to protests. He's not using Open Society Foundations, the philanthropic organization he founded, to fund ""the chaos"" in Minneapolis, where a police officer pressed his knee against Floyd's neck. 
An image being shared on Facebook now makes another claim about Soros in connection with the protests. It appears to show a tweet from actor James Woods, who uses the social media platform to comment on current events. 
""This man funds #ANTIFA,"" the text says above two photos -- one of Soros and one of a younger man in an SS uniform. ""He is a real #NAZI. His name is George Soros.""
This post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
As we've reported antifa -- which stands for ""anti-fascist"" -- is a broad, loosely affiliated coalition of left-wing activists. The Trump administration has blamed antifa for recent protests but government intelligence reports, media reports and experts haven't produced any evidence that supports that claim. 
We couldn't find the tweet searching Woods' account, but we're fact-checking the claims that appear in the Facebook post.
First, as we've previously reported, Soros was not a Nazi. 
The person in the photo in the Facebook post is Oskar Groning, one of 300 Auschwitz staff members. Groning was a corporal in Adolf Hitler's Waffen SS and he became known as the bookkeeper of Auschwitz. He was one of the last Germans to face war-crime charges connected to the Holocaust.

Soros fled fascism. When the Nazis invaded Hungary, his father obtained false identities for Soros and his brother and Soros was sent to live with an agricultural official who passed him off as his Christian godson. 
""This is how Mr. Soros was able to survive the Nazi occupation,"" Open Society said in the statement. ""Mr. Soros was hiding from the Nazis in order to survive. To construe this in any other way is malicious, completely misleading, and, in fact, anti-Semitic.""
Next, there is no evidence Soros ""funds antifa.""
Open Society Foundations refuted the claim and said that neither Soros or Open Society fund antifa. In a statement, a spokesperson for the organization said the false claims ""touch on longstanding, often anti-Semtiic conspiracy theories.""  
When Fox Business published a story in June about antifa and ""who funds it,"" the story noted that it's a difficult question to answer. ""Little is known about who funds antifa activists, or how the groups get their resources,"" the story said. ""Antifa is not a single organization, and therefore, financial details, if any exist, are murky.""
Mark Bray, a historian at Rutgers University who wrote ""Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,"" told PolitiFact that the Facebook post reflects ""an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that the right has launched at all kinds of radical organizing over the years.""
""Antifa groups do not have much in the way of funds,"" he said. ""The International Anti-Fascist Defence Fund exists to provide funds for medical or legal expenses of antifascists and those funds come from donations from allies but beyond that I'd imagine that whatever little money these groups have come from members themselves.""
We couldn't find any evidence that Soros has contributed to this fund.

Snopes is still fighting an ""infodemic"" of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help. Find out what we've learned and how to inoculate yourself against COVID-19 misinformation. Read the latest fact checks about the vaccines. Submit any questionable rumors and ""advice"" you encounter. Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease.



 







In mid-July 2021, Stew Peters, a conservative internet talk show host who has a track record for spreading COVID-19 vaccine misinformation, used his show on the video platform Rumble to spread more COVID-19 vaccine misinformation.
Snopes readers emailed us asking about a post seen on Facebook from a Qanon conspiracy theory website containing the headline, ""VIDEO: HORRIFIC! - FIVE Jet Blue Airlines Pilots DEAD, Media Intentionally Hiding Vaxx Fears."" The post contained a link to Peters' show.
During that July 16 show, Peters and his guest Dr. Jane Ruby (who is not a medical doctor) claimed that five JetBlue pilots died as a result of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine shot. But oddly Ruby also admitted she didn't know whether any of the pilots mentioned even received the shot. (We added bold text to the key portion of the quote below):
This is another bombshell, an airline we have not heard about or from yet. It's JetBlue. A pilot has come forward who's still actively in the company to let us know that five JetBlue pilots passed away between February of this year and May. There's no direct information yet about their jab status. But he, this pilot does acknowledge that the company is keeping that kind of thing very quiet.
Ruby then goes on to name five JetBlue employees who died between February and May of 2021. JetBlue has about 20,000 employees.
In company marketing materials, JetBlue said it encouraged employees to get vaccinated and that the ""majority"" of crew members had received the vaccine.
In obituaries found online for the JetBlue employees named by Ruby, two mentioned the cause of death. In those cases, the deaths had nothing to do with COVID-19 or the vaccine. One pilot died in a UTV accident. Another died of cancer.
In a statement emailed to Snopes, JetBlue acknowledged that four pilots died in 2021. One employee named by Ruby wasn't a pilot, but an inflight crew member. The company called the video an effort to intentionally mislead the public:
JetBlue is aware of a report that mentions four of our pilots and one inflight crewmember who have passed away this year. While we mourn their loss, there is no connection in their deaths or to the COVID-19 vaccine. The social media video appears designed to intentionally deceive the public and should not be considered a trusted source of information.
The claim that five JetBlue ""pilots"" died from the vaccine echoes a similar claim about British Airways. That claim was also false and used the same method of apparently trawling the internet for people from the same airline company who died in prior months, then claiming without evidence they died from the vaccine.
Peters and Ruby had previously taken to the show to claim that the vaccines were injected magnets into people, a claim that spectacularly backfired in an attempted live demonstration that went viral:

Wow. An anti-vaccine nurse in Ohio tried to prove the Vaccines Cause Magnetism theory in an state legislative committee. The demonstration did not go to plan pic.twitter.com/0ubELst4E8
-- Tyler Buchanan (@Tylerjoelb) June 9, 2021

We are rating this claim ""False"" because it comes from an unreliable source with a track record for spreading misinformation, and by the source's own admission, there is insufficient evidence to support the claim. We also note that the evidence that is available -- namely the cause of death in two of the five cases -- directly contradicts the claim.

317.SaysMarkZuckerbergsrealnameisJacobGreenbergandhesthegrandsonofbillionaireDavidRockefeller,"
An online conspiracy theory claims Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's ""real"" name is Jacob Greenberg, and that he's secretly the grandson of the late David Rockefeller and the family established an elaborate scheme to make money off of the social media network. 
The Facebook post features photos of Zuckerberg, Rockefeller and the Central Intelligence Agency logo.
It reads: 
""Did you know that Mark Zuckerberg's real name is Jacob Greenberg? And he is the grandson of David Rockefeller. Zuckerberg is German for 'sugar mountain.' Their clandestine word for 'Facebook' No doubt: A mountain of information from which they can extract billions. The Rothschild's own nearly 10% of all Facebook shares and FB was funded with $500,000,000 USD from a CIA owned bank, which is not a secret.""
All of this is nonsense. Zuckerberg's ""real"" name is not Jacob Greenberg, his grandfather was not David Rockefeller, and there is no evidence of a money-making scheme involving the CIA.

Zuckerberg shares no relation to the Rockefeller family. He was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, N.Y.., to parents Karen and Edward Zuckerberg.
A Facebook spokesperson told PolitiFact the Rockefeller claim is false. 
This bizarre theory appears to date back to 2012, when a man named Jacob Greenberg was arrested for marijuana possession in Arizona and some people thought his mugshot looked a lot like Zuckerberg.
But a close look shows they're not the same person. Zuckerberg was a billionaire at this point, so an arrest for drugs in Arizona would have been covered by local and national media outlets. 
Still, there are conspiracy theorists who say Zuckerberg is secretly the grandson of Maurice ""Hank"" Greenberg, who was once a member of the Rockefeller-founded trilateral commission, and who supposedly married one of Rockefeller's four daughters. Maurice Greenberg did marry a woman named Corinne Phyllis Zuckerman, but she's not David Rockefeller's daughter and doesn't appear to share any relation with the Rockefeller family -- or with Mark Zuckerberg.

Editor's Note: PolitiFact has reviewed court filings and other information for hundreds of defendants facing charges related to the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol in an ongoing effort to document what role misinformation played. This report reflects some of our findings about the way that hundreds of false claims about the 2020 election being stolen contributed to the events of that day. Our reporting will continue; read a previous report here. To comment on this story, please go to our Facebook page. Send feedback or tips via email to [email protected].  
The moment showed unexpected order in what was otherwise the chaotic invasion of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.
A group of about 11 people snaked single-file through the crowd toward the building's east side. They wore helmets and olive-green combat gear, vests and backpacks. Each stretched one arm forward to clasp the shoulder of the person in front of them.
An FBI investigator recognized the configuration when he saw it unfold in one of the hundreds of videos that surfaced from that day. It was ""a tactical formation used by infantrymen in the military,"" the investigator later wrote in a federal complaint charging the people involved with federal crimes, including conspiracy. ""The purpose of maintaining direct physical contact with one another is to efficiently communicate, especially in crowded or noisy areas.""

(A photo contained in federal court documents shows Oath Keepers militia members moving up the steps of the U.S. Capitol in a military stack formation.)
 
The group soon forced its way to the front of a crowd gathered around a set of Capitol doors. It didn't take long for them to make it inside.
 
Court records show that of the more than 500 people charged in connection with the Jan. 6 insurrection, no one was more coordinated in their efforts to disrupt the congressional certification of the U.S. electoral votes than individuals like these.
 

The people in the Capitol steps formation were Oath Keepers, militarily-trained people who spoke with one another about commitment to their ""oath"" -- one to ""uphold the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic."" Their ranks included active-duty military, veterans and some with law enforcement experience, people who had joined up with the organization since its founding in 2009. The group's motto, ""not on our watch,"" emphasized a level of vigilance against a perceived threat that could strike at any time.
 
Their leaders sent top-down messages ordering members to protest and fight. Some trained before they came and brought armor, tools and weapons. They raised money for protective gear and travel to D.C. Some attacked police. In many cases, prosecutors say, members of far-right groups helped escalate the rally into a full-on attack.
 
Of approximately 40 people facing conspiracy charges as of early September, 19 were associated with the far-right Oath Keepers militia, according to PolitiFact's review of court files. Another 17 were affiliated with the Proud Boys extremist group. As part of PolitiFact's ongoing look at how misinformation fueled the events of Jan. 6, we examined the case files of defendants associated with Oath Keepers and found they tell a story of preparation, communication and structure.
 
Jan. 6 was, in the words of one Oath Keeper affiliate, ""everything we f------ trained for.""
 
'Awaiting direction'
Jessica Watkins was a 38-year-old former Army Ranger and veteran of the war in Afghanistan. She joined right out of high school in 2001 and completed airborne training before being deployed, according to reporting by BuzzFeed. 
Watkins was forced out of the military ""after her sexual orientation was discovered,"" her attorney wrote in a motion for home detention.
She later joined a nonprofit working on HIV prevention and took a job as a full-time firefighter and EMT when she returned to civilian life. 
Watkins formed a small paramilitary group called the Ohio State Regular Militia, of which she described herself the commander. Her partner told Buzzfeed she was motivated to organize the group after a string of tornadoes left thousands of people without power in Dayton, Ohio. Prosecutors have referred to the militia in court documents as a ""dues-paying subset of the Oath Keepers."" 
Most recently, Watkins was working at The Jolly Roger, a small bar in Woodstock, Ohio, that she owned and operated with her boyfriend. 
But it wasn't long until COVID-19 started to take a toll on the business. 
""My small business is a bar,"" Watkins wrote on the conservative social media platform Parler just days before the Capitol riot. ""Empty on a Saturday. ... Guess I am going to go pack for DC now. See you there.""
The pandemic continued to worsen, protests against lockdowns and police brutality sprang up in cities and towns across the country, her militia started to patrol the protests and Watkins started to fall in with the Oath Keepers.
By the fall of 2020, she was in direct contact with the organization's leadership about plans to travel to D.C. to overturn the results of a presidential election that she believed was stolen.  
In one Nov. 9 text, she told someone that she was ""awaiting direction"" from Trump following the results of Joe Biden's victory. She recruited and trained people who expressed interest in joining the militia, according to prosecutors, telling one, ""I need you fighting fit by the inauguration.""'
On Nov. 17, when a recruit asked her for her predictions for 2021, Watkins replied, ""I can't predict. I don't underestimate the resolve of the Deep State. Biden may still yet be our President. If he is, our way of life as we know it is over. Our Republic would be over. Then it is our duty as Americans to fight, kill and die for our rights,"" court documents show.
Donovan Crowl, then a 50-year-old former Marine corporal who held occasional jobs in construction, had frequented Watkins' bar and eventually joined her militia and the Oath Keepers organization. 
Crowl, prosecutors said, traveled with Watkins to the Capitol for the insurrection. As he marched up the Capitol steps with the stack he donned a combat helmet, ballistic goggles and a handheld radio, photo and video evidence showed. 
When authorities later searched Watkins' Woodstock, Ohio, home after the riot, they recovered what appeared to be instructions on how to make explosives with bleach. 
They also found camouflage hats and jackets, a black tactical kit with medical supplies, radios, helmets and ""numerous"" firearms, according to court records. The clothing and gear, prosecutors said, matched the attire worn by members of the stack.
'Trump said it's going to be wild'
On Nov. 9, days after the 2020 presidential election showed Biden winning, Oath Keepers from across the country met virtually on GotoMeeting video conferencing service. The organization's founder, Stewart Rhodes, called on members to go to Washington, D.C.
""We're going to defend the president, the duly elected president, and we call on him to do what needs to be done to save our country,"" Rhodes said. ""Because if you don't, guys, you're going to be in a bloody, bloody civil war, and a bloody -- you can call it an insurrection or you can call it a war or fight."" 
Rhodes, a former U.S. Army paratrooper and Yale Law School graduate, added that the group would be awaiting the president's orders: ""We hope he will give us the orders. We want him to declare an insurrection, and to call us up as the militia."" 
The Oath Keepers is a large but loosely organized paramilitary group that recruits current or former military and law enforcement and emphasizes military training. The organization's leaders, like Rhodes, as well as its members have shared misinformation about so-called government plots since its founding in 2009, months after President Barack Obama was sworn in. The organization, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, has grown into one of the largest radical anti-government groups in the country. 
The modern militia movement came into focus in the U.S. in the mid 1990s and largely consists of right-wing, armed paramilitary groups with anti-government or conspiracy-orientated ideologies. Militia groups began to form not long after the deadly standoff at Waco, Texas, in 1993, and by the spring of 1995, they had spread to almost every state, according to the Anti- Defamation League. 
Timothy McVeigh, the perpetrator in the Oklahoma City bombing at a federal building that killed 168 people and injured more than 680 others in 1995, was a veteran of the Gulf War and sympathizer with the U.S. militia movement who sought to retaliate against the federal government for its role in Waco. McVeigh's act was the worst act of domestic terrorism by a U.S. citizen.  
Anti-government groups like the Oath Keepers aren't typically picky about membership, experts said, but military experience is considered a plus.
""The Oath Keepers have a specific motivation to reach out to veterans in regards to their motto to honor their oath, but their reasoning is also functional,"" said Samuel Jackson, an assistant professor and expert on the militia movement at the University at Albany, New York. ""Many of these people have experiences in combat but also intelligence and psychological operations. There's a huge variety of skills that would be useful for an organization that perceives, anticipates and, at times, might want to bring about violence.""
Members believe that the U.S. government has been ""co-opted"" by a ""cabal of elites"" who are actively trying to strip American citizens of their rights, prosecutors argue in their court filings. 
Rhodes, 56, has frequently appeared on Alex Jones' conspiracy theory-laden show InfoWars, and members have served as security at prominent GOP events and for Trump allies like Republican operative Roger Stone.
Rhodes warned his followers during that Nov. 9 meeting to come  prepared to fight antifa, a left-wing, anti-fascist movement, according to court dcuments that show he asked some to come fully armed.
""If the fight comes, let the fight come. Let antifa -- if they go kinetic on us, then we'll go kinetic back on them,"" Rhodes said, according to court documents that show he asked some to come fully armed.
Kelly Meggs, a 52-year-old car dealership manager from Dunnellon, Fla., answered the call. As the self-described leader of the Florida Oath Keepers, Meggs told others on Facebook that he was in touch with the far-right extremist Proud Boys group, and another right-wing militia organization known as the Three Percenters.
""We have decided to work together and shut this s--- down,"" he wrote Dec. 19, court filings show. The coordination made sense he said in another message a few days later: ""They always have a big group. Force multiplier.""
The Proud Boys would get in front of antifa and then police officers would try to separate the two groups, he said. That's when Oath Keepers would come in. 
""We will come in behind antifa and beat the hell out of them,"" he wrote.

(Screenshot from federal court documents.)
 
A few days later Meggs predicted they would have at least 50 to 100 Oath Keepers in D.C.
 
""Trump said it's going to be wild!!!!!!!...He wants us to make it WILD, that's what he's saying,"" Meggs wrote on Facebook. 
 
By Dec. 31, Watkins, Meggs and others had joined an invitation-only encrypted group on the messaging app Signal, court documents show. They titled their group ""DC OP: Jan 6 21."" They participated in online meetings and used that channel as well as other encrypted communications to coordinate their plans.
 
One man pledged in the encrypted chat that he would bring an assault rifle and a backpack full of ammunition if ""s--- truly"" hit the fan.
 
When another offered to help with weapons, someone on the chat responded that they already had a ""s---load of QRF on standby with an arsenal."" In the military, a QRF, or a quick reaction force, is an armed unit capable of rapidly responding to developing situations, typically to assist allied units.
 
On Jan. 1, Thomas Caldwell -- a former U.S. Navy intelligence officer and FBI official from Virginia in his mid-60s who helped plan with the Oath Keepers -- replied to a Facebook comment, writing: ""I accept that assignment! I swore to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic,"" filings show. ""I did the former, I have done the latter peacefully but they have morphed into pure evil even blatantly rigging an election and paying off the political caste. We must smite them now and drive them down.""
 
Watkins, Crowl and others drove together to Washington on Jan. 4.
 
Meggs, who traveled separately from Florida with his wife, announced a plan for a 3 p.m. rally. He instructed others to bring mace, gas masks and batons because ""D.C. is no guns.""
 
""If you have armor,"" he added, ""that's good.""
 
Before they got there, they discussed secured parking areas and posted maps of D.C., pinpointing various water and land access areas. One defendant sent a text suggesting they get a boat to transport ""heavy weapons"" across the Potomac River. Another reached out to a company seeking ""ultimate training munitions rifle class"" for Oath Keepers.
 

(Screenshot from federal court documents.)
 
They chatted about guns -- should they bring them or not? Should they stage them somewhere else? How about stashing them at a ""farm location""? Some people reported they planned to bring ""long rifles"" and sidearms, according to court documents. Watkins said she was eager to drop off and secure weapons with the QRF before what she termed ""the Op.""
 
It's not clear exactly how many firearms or other weapons were present at the Jan. 6 riot, but we know that they were there. Overwhelmed, police arrested and had direct contact with only a fraction of those who lay siege on the Capitol that day. But court records and news reports show that many insurrectionists were armed, with several being charged with having firearms on Capitol grounds or stashed nearby while in D.C. 
 
Video plainly shows the mob using all manner of makeshift weapons to attack police and force their way in, including clubs, hockey sticks, flagpoles, pepper and bear spray, knives, brass knuckles, fire extinguishers, a stun gun, and a police shield stolen from an officer.
 
'Patriots are taking it into their own hands'
When Jan. 6 arrived, the group prepared themselves for battle, equipped with communication devices and various tactical items including vests, helmets, ballistic goggles and hard-knuckle gloves, prosecutors said.
Between around 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. Rhodes exchanged roughly 10 phone calls with members, court documents show, including several with Meggs. He also messaged the Leadership Signal Chat at 1:25 p.m.
""Pence is doing nothing. As I predicted,"" he wrote, referencing Vice President Mike Pence's decision to approve the certification of Biden's win in spite of pressure from Trump and others to refuse. ""All I see Trump doing is complaining,"" he wrote about 15 minutes later. ""I see no intent by him to do anything. So the patriots are taking it into their own hands. They've had enough.""
The situation outside of the Capitol quickly deteriorated. A crowd gathered outside the east side doors threw objects, sprayed chemicals at police, and pulled violently on the doors to forcibly push their way into the Capitol, the indictment said.
The Oath Keepers traveled in its military stack up the Capitol steps. Video shows them pushing into the mob and advancing toward the Rotunda doors.
""Who's our president?"" someone is heard shouting off-camera.
""Trump!"" the crowd responds.
""Who's our president?""
""Trump!""
As the doors open and people start to enter, someone sends up a cheer, ""Oath Keepers!"" 
Another man is heard registering his amazement: ""We're the first wave, man! This has never been done.""
Inside, the stack remained in formation and told Oath Keepers outside that they made it in. 
""We're in the f------ Capitol!"" Watkins said in a video after they made it into the Capitol rotunda. Watkins and Crowl turned the camera around for a selfie.

(Screenshot from federal court documents shows a selfie Oath Keepers Donovan Crowl and Jessica Watkins posed for inside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.)
 
Once inside, members of the stack swept through the Capitol, and Watkins got a shout-out on the group chat:
 
""Get it, Jess. Do your f------ thing. Everything we f------ trained for.""
 
After Watkins was arrested, her attorneys argued that Trump's rhetoric helped mislead and inflame supporters, especially ones with military backgrounds like Watkins. They believed Trump would invoke the Insurrection Act to use the military to keep himself in office, despite the election results. 
 
""While some of the rhetoric she allegedly engaged in is troubling,"" her attorneys wrote in a motion for bond, ""she fell prey to the false and inflammatory claims of the former president, his supporters, and the right wing media.""
 
Anti-government extremists thrive on misinformation
Experts who study and track extremist and anti-government militia organizations said most members of these types of far-right groups have been immersed in conspiracy theories for years and employ misinformation to get people angry and recruit them to their causes. 
""The concept of a new world order, a tyrannical government, of entities wanting to take away their guns. Those are tried-and-true narratives that have animated people within the broader anti-government movement,"" said Oren Segal, the vice president of the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. ""And, they found a friend in QAnon that approached this from a different, semi-incoherent space, but that was making some of the same allegations.""
One way that manifested was in the group's apparent belief that it would be fighting antifa on Jan. 6. As Crowl wrote on Facebook the day prior, they were going ""tifa hunt'in.""
""We expect good hunting,"" he wrote.
The reality was far different. In court files of more than 550 people arrested in connection with the storming of the Capitol as of early September, PolitiFact found only one who mentioned an association with far-left causes, a man who identified himself as a journalist but who had no press credentials. While some in conservative circles pointed to defendant John Sullivan as ""known antifa,"" PolitiFact and other fact-checkers have found no evidence of that based on interviews and reviews of public records.
Most of those present that day were pro-Trump allies who believed their candidate's false assertion that the election had been stolen. Yet Trump allies, including some associated with Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, baselessly called the attack an antifa set-up, a claim that PolitiFact and others have repeatedly debunked.
""I think many of the people who were there were planning on engaging in that conflict with antifa,"" said Jackson, the militia expert. ""They believed someone needed to be ready to push back against antifa violence ... and this ties into how much they believe that antifa is a well-formed group for which violence is really central.""
The 2020 election wasn't the first time the Oath Keepers expressed mistrust in the country's oldest democratic process.
Many were ordered to station themselves at polling locations across the country during the 2016 presidential election to ""watch out"" for voter fraud. The group believed that if Trump didn't win the popular vote by a landslide, Jackson told us, it was the work of Democrats deliberately undermining the votes.
They organized their call to action shortly after Trump started prophesying that the election would be rigged. 
""I hear these horror shows, and we have to make sure that this election is not stolen from us and is not taken away from us,"" Trump said in October 2016 to a crowd in Pennsylvania. ""And everybody knows what I'm talking about.""
Post-Jan. 6 reckoning leaves uncertainty
This isn't all about the past. Nine months after the nation watched hundreds of people enter and ransack the U.S. Capitol, the Oath Keepers and groups like the Proud Boys remain active. 
In the face of federal charges and national spectacle, experts say, members of these groups -- whether they are defendants who were there that day or not -- find themselves grappling with the gravity of what transpired.
Watkins, in a February court hearing disavowed Oath Keepers and rescinded her membership, saying she was ""humbled"" and ""humiliated"" by the charges against her.
Her attorneys told the federal government that Watkins has disbanded her militia, and rid herself of all firearms. 
""She has declared she is sickened by what happened in the Capitol on Jan. 6,"" they wrote in a motion arguing for bond, saying she wants to return home to a simple life.
Watkins' lawyers argue that her intention all along was simply to provide security to the speakers of the rally and to safely escort protestors away from the Capitol to their vehicles -- not to be an insurrectionist. They said she was given a VIP pass to the rally and even ""met with secret service agents."" 
But her comments shortly after the riot paint a different picture. 
""Me after forcing entry into the Capitol building,"" read one of Watkins' posts on Parler after the riot. 
""Yeah we stormed the Capitol today. Teargassed, the whole 9. Pushed our way into the Rotunda. Made it into the Senate even. The news is lying (even Fox) about the Historical Events we created today.""
PolitiFact reached out to the attorneys for Watkins, Crowl, Meggs and Caldwell, as well as representatives for other defendants belonging to the Oath Keepers. Some declined to comment. We didn't hear back from others.
Intelligence agencies warned in March of the ongoing threat that racially-motivated extremist groups might carry out mass-casualty attacks on civilians, while militia organizations like the Oath Keepers would target police and government personnel and buildings. 
Fallout from the Jan. 6 riot, as well as conspiracy theories and the election lie, ""will almost certainly spur"" some domestic extremists ""to try to engage in violence this year,"" read the assessment from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.
Segal of the ADL's Center on Extremism said that the instability these groups are experiencing can create its own threat as people splinter off into smaller, less visible groups.
""I think with time it's going to be clear that either the events of the 6th, or the narrative that animated people to action on the 6th, will continue into the near future,"" Segal said. ""Jan. 6th may very well be the incubator for plots of the future, and we don't have the luxury to assume otherwise.""
PolitiFact reporters Bill McCarthy and Gabrielle Settles and researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.

Audio of a 911 call is being shared on Facebook  incorrectly claiming it's linked to the dozens of migrants found dead in a truck on June 27 in San Antonio Texas. 
A Facebook user published the recording on June 28 with a caption in Spanish that translates to:""CALL FOR HELP RELEASED. The call for help from a migrant to 911 alerted officials over the abandoned group in the trailer,, minutes later authorities found them lifeless in San Antonio Texas United States."" 
This post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
In the audio a man can be heard asking for help as he tells the operator that there are 80 people in a white tanker truck and that they cannot breath. The operator is heard as voices cry out in the background. 
After searching the words ""white tanker truck"" PolitiFact found a video with the 911 call from the immigrants. 
However, the call is not from the victims of the incident in San Antonio, Texas. The audio is from a recording published on YouTube by Noticias Telemundo on February 11, 2021. That reporting was about a group of immigrants who were trapped in a tanker truck. 
In the video the timestamp of February 8, 2021 can be seen as a white tanker truck is captured passing along the road. 
President Joe Biden said initial reports indicate that the incident was caused by smugglers or human traffickers and announced the beginning of a federal investigation.

Yesterday's loss of life in San Antonio is horrifying - my prayers are with those who lost their lives, their loved ones, and those still fighting for their lives.My Administration will continue to do everything possible to stop criminal smugglers from exploiting migrants.-- President Biden (@POTUS) June 28, 2022 
Federal officials say they've arrested four men and charged one with human smuggling resulting in death; another faces a conspiracy charge and two others face ""one count of possession of a weapon by an alien illegally in the U.S.""
A press release from the Justice Department said one of the men was found at the scene of the crime where he acted as if he was one of the immigrants but was later identified as the driver of the truck by Border Patrol agents. Phone investigations linked the other three men to the incident and they were later arrested. 
According to theJustice Department, San Antonio police arrived at the scene after receiving 911 calls from concerned citizens. On June 27 officials discovered 48 people dead at the scene, days after, the number jumped to 53 people. 
Our ruling 
A recording published on Facebook claims to show a 911 call placed by the migrants trapped in the truck found in San Antonio, Texas on June 27.
However, the recording is from an incident that occured in February 8, 2021 when 80 immigrants were trapped in a tanker truck.

On 21 July 2018, a video purportedly showing a 2000-year-old carving of a man riding bicycle found inside of an ancient temple in India was posted to Facebook by Mohan Praveen, the host of the ""Phenomenal Travel Videos"" YouTube show:

Praveen argued in a longer version of this video posted to his YouTube channel that this extraordinary finding was puzzling because the modern bicycle wasn't invented until the 19th century, but the temple in which a carving of a bicycle was found, the Panchavarnaswamy Temple, was built over 2,000 years ago.
Is this bicycle carving, as Praveen hypothesized in a tweet, evidence of an ""advanced ancient technology?""
Praveen claimed that historians were attempting to discredit this miraculous finding by arguing that this ""ancient"" temple was actually constructed only a hundred years ago. After an unnecessarily long explanation of what the carving depicts (a man on a bike), Praveen asserted that the temple undeniably dates to at least the 7th century, long before the development of the modern bicycle:


How was this carved in this ancient temple which is about 2,000 years old?
Some have argued that this temple was entirely built just a hundred years ago. Since this is not an ancient temple, all these carvings are new and sculptors carved what they saw. There were bikes hundred years ago so it was easy for sculptors to carve this. Are experts right about this? Is it possible that this is a new temple built in the last century? No, because this temple is mentioned in the 7th century text called Tevaram.
The experts that we've encountered, however, haven't argued that this ""temple was entirely built just a hundred years ago."" Rather, they've argued that specific portions of this 2,000-year-old temple were renovated about a hundred years ago, and that a sculptor working on those relatively modern renovations added the carving of a by-now-common bicycle at that time.
In 2015, long before this carving was presented as an ""unexplained"" marking on an ancient temple in a variety of clickbait articles, Dr. R. Kalaikovan provided a much more logical explanation for it to The Hindu:
""After the prayer, while taking a look around, I came across the carving of a bicycle on a pillar behind the Amman temple,"" says Dr. Kalaikovan. ""It was so funny and intriguing to see the picture of a cycle in an ancient temple. But neither the officials nor the scholar who wrote its history, were able to explain how it came there. I started researching this fact.""
Through multiple forays into the history of the bicycle (which was invented in Germany in 1800s), and the Chola-era Woraiyur temple, he theorised that the vehicle was possibly a novelty in Tiruchi of the 1920s, when the temple had been renovated. ""Perhaps the sculptor had seen someone on a cycle, was impressed by it and had recorded it forever on stone,"" says Dr. Kalaikovan.
This isn't the first time that the ""discovery"" of a depiction of a modern object on the walls of an ancient structure has served as fodder for a conspiracy theory. Photographs showing a carving of an astronaut on the wall of a 12th century Spanish cathedral have been circulating for years along with theories about the ""unexplained"" phenomena. However, as was the case with this bicycle carving, the ""ancient astronaut"" was added to the cathedral during a renovation conducted in the 1990s. A carving of an ""ancient alien cellphone"" was similarly found to be the work of a modern artist.

A website that was banned from Facebook rebranded as a pro-Trump news outlet to reach its audience, peddling debunked claims about the nationwide Black Lives Matter protests.
Natural News was one of the websites that promoted ""Plandemic,"" a viral documentary that made a slew of false claims about COVID-19. On May 29, NBC News reported that Facebook banned Natural News content on its platform.
Facebook said Natural News was using content farms in North Macedonia and the Philippines to make its content look more popular than it actually was -- a violation of Facebook's rules against spam. The website's Facebook page was removed in June 2019 for a similar policy violation.
Recently, Natural News tried getting around Facebook's ban by publishing articles on a website called Trump.News. It used the website to push false and unproven stories about demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis police custody after a white officer kneeled on his neck.
A June 3 article on Trump.News about a looming antifa plot against farms included this note:
""Facebook will not allow you to share this story from NaturalNews.com, as Facebook has blacklisted this entire website in order to censor reporting that exposes antifa and other criminals operating in America. To share this story, look for it on Trump.news and share from there.""
RELATED: Fact-checking misinformation about the George Floyd protests
We reached out to Facebook for a comment on how Trump.News is getting around the platform's ban on content from Natural News. It told us that the domain is no longer being shared on Facebook.
The Trump.News article cites anonymous sources to claim that groups associated with antifa, a broad coalition of left-wing, anti-fascist activists, are being ""bused to Sparta, Illinois with orders to burn farm houses and kill livestock in rural 'white' areas.""
When asked if he's seen any evidence to back up the article, Sparta Police Chief Sean Lukes said: ""not at all.""
""I reviewed it and it's been reported to the Illinois State Police and they're checking into it to see if there's any validity,"" he said.
The article is similar to a false conspiracy theory that antifa groups are ""moving out of the cities - and into residential areas."" Before it was suspended, a white nationalist organization disguised as an antifa cell spread the bogus claim on Twitter. Donald Trump Jr. even shared it on Instagram.
There is no evidence that antifa activists are targeting residential or rural areas. Despite statements from Trump and the White House, it's still unclear to what extent the movement is involved in violence at Black Lives Matter protests around the country. 
Still, Trump.News has published several stories about antifa's alleged involvement in Black Lives Matter protests. They are identical to stories published on NaturalNews.com; the difference was that Trump.News articles reached thousands of Facebook users.

(Screenshots from Natural News and Trump.News)
According to CrowdTangle, an audience metrics tool, the website's unproven story about antifa activists traveling to Sparta was shared more than 4,000 times on Facebook. It was widely circulated in groups for believers in QAnon, a broad, right-wing conspiracy theory.
The same story on Natural News' website hasn't been shared on Facebook or other social media platforms, according to CrowdTangle.
Mike Adams, the owner of Natural News and author of the story about Sparta and antifa, has dozens of other websites. Rory Smith, a research manager at First Draft, an organization that studies the spread of misinformation, found more than 200 domains that appear to be related to Natural News.
""It looks like each of these websites has the exact same layout,"" Smith said in a message. ""So Mike Adams has expanded his junk news empire.""
Some of those sites, like Collapse.news and Chaos.news, have also published the story about antifa groups and Sparta. Others, like Racewar.news, have posted different stories about Black Lives Matter protests. Some even impersonate legitimate media outlets, like Snopes and the Washington Post.
Many of the sites include a header that links to a story from Trump.news about Trump's recent executive order to increase regulation of social media platforms. The order came after Twitter appended a cautionary flag to one of the president's tweets about mail-in ballots and voter fraud.

We reached out to Natural News for a comment, but we haven't heard back.
PolitiFact partners with Facebook to find and reduce the reach of misinformation on the platform. Once we rate a post as False, its future reach in the News Feed is decreased and the pages who shared it receive a warning. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
For misinformers looking to get around that system, switching domains is an easy and effective tactic. Experts say it shouldn't be.
""I think it's part of Facebook's responsibility that if, they're going to ban a platform from posting because of misinformation, then simply changing your website shouldn't be enough to get you back online,"" said Lisa Fazio, an assistant professor of psychology and human development at Vanderbilt University.

A Snopes investigation on 15 May 2019 looked deeply into a small group of radical evangelical Christians that re-purposed Facebook pages and PACs to build a coordinated, pro-Trump network that spreads hate and conspiracy theories -- below is a re-cap of key points. The content includes the assertion that the survivors of the Parkland school massacre are on a ""leftist-Islamic payroll"" and that Islamic refugee resettlement is ""cultural destruction and subjugation.""
The names of these Facebook pages imply diverse support from Americans, with titles like ""Blacks for Trump"" and ""Jews and Christians for America."" But Snopes.com found that each of these pages can be tied to a radical evangelical activist named Kelly Monroe Kullberg, who is neither black nor Jewish. We found at least 24 pages in the Kullberg network, which could be in violation of Facebook's ban on ""coordinated inauthentic behavior.""

Snopes also found that at least one prominent GOP donor, William Millis, funded and/or exploited the efforts of the Kullberg network. Millis was a fundraiser and campaign board member for current HUD Secretary Ben Carson's 2016 presidential campaign.
Why does this matter? This network, and others that employ similar tactics, can affect online discourse in several ways:

The network serves to influence public opinion by presenting the views of a small group of activists as representative of a much broader swath of the American populace.
Their strategy amplifies and offers a veil of legitimacy to hatred and conspiracy theories.
In spite of these strategies awash in misinformation, the pages within the network have attracted the financial backing of well-heeled political donors who exploit these pages and groups to disguise the origin of political Facebook ads.
Facebook has not publicly commented on whether the Kullberg network violates their terms of service, but two posts we showed them (and no one else) were deleted after we reached out to the company for comment.

What do experts say?

""Evangelical organizations are the primary funders of anti-Muslim animus."" Abbas Barzegar, the director of the Department of Research and Advocacy at the Council on American-Islamic Relations.
""I think if you came to Facebook and said, 'Hey, the Russians are doing this,' they would have taken the pages down."" - Joshua Tucker, a professor of politics and data science at NYU and an expert at online disinformation.

The bottom line?
Social media platforms like Facebook have allowed hateful Islamophobic, conspiratorial rhetoric to be amplified and boosted inauthentically on their platforms, and these platforms continue to benefit from the revenue and reach of political operatives who exploit the networks.

Thanks in part to a long-discredited (but deeply entrenched) assertion that the MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) vaccine has been linked to increased rates of autism, fear of vaccination has been rife on blogs and social media groups devoted to the discussion of alternative medicine. A common, uniting element of such rumors is their longevity, due in part to the oft-present claim that the purported ""vaccine truth"" has been covered up or buried by large interests, in particular, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
In October 2015, many alternative health sites published some variation of a claim the CDC had ""admitted"" that 98 million Americans had over the years been injected with a cancer-causing virus along with their polio vaccine. Then in keeping with the template of the rumor, the CDC supposedly endeavored to immediately eradicate that information from any form of record. Why they ""admitted"" such a thing on the Internet in the first place rather than concealing it entirely is not addressed by the rumors: the CDC of conspiracy theory imagination is always clever enough to do retroactive clean-up in an attempt to cover their tracks but never smart enough to avoid publishing damaging information in the first place. But fortunately a few eagle-eyed folks managed to bust the vast conspiracy via the magic of Google cache:

CDC 'Disappears' Page Linking Polio Vaccines To Cancer-Causing Viruses https://t.co/A0ypmtOFQh
-- CaliVaxChoice (@CaliVaxChoice) October 28, 2015
 






On 25 October 2015, Viral Alternative News published an article titled ""CDC admits 98 million Americans were given a cancer causing virus via the polio shot,"" which followed on the heels of a September 2015 article from the web site Vaccines.News headlined ""CDC admits 98 million Americans were given cancer virus via the polio shot"" (credited to a reporter by the name of ""evilnews""), the latter of which cited InvestmentWatch's August 2015 piece titled ""CDC Admits 98 Million Americans Received Polio Vaccine in an 8-Year Span When It Was Contaminated With Cancer Virus"":
The CDC has quickly removed a page from their website, which WAS cached here (since removed by Google so you can view an image of the cache here), admitting that more than 98 million Americans received one or more doses of polio vaccine within an 8-year span from 1955-1963 when a proportion of the vaccine was contaminated with a cancer causing polyomavirus called SV40. It has been estimated that 10-30 million Americans could have received an SV40 contaminated dose of the vaccine.
First of all, the CDC never ""admitted"" that anyone ever contracted cancer from a polio vaccination. What the CDC actually said was:
o Sometime around 1960, Simian Virus 40 (SV40) was discovered in the injected form of the polio vaccine (IPV).
o The SV40 virus has been found in certain types of cancer in humans.
o Between 1955 and 1963, when some portion of the IPV was contaminated with SV40, roughly 98 million Americans received at least one dose of polio vaccine.
Clearly 98 million Americans were not ""given [a] cancer virus via the polio shot,"" because not every single polio vaccination undertaken between the years of 1955 and 1963 involved vaccine contaminated with SV40: the CDC estimated that somewhere between 10 and 30 million Americans might have received SV40-contaminated vaccine during that period. Moreover, SV40 is not a ""cancer virus,"" and there is no definitive evidence that either SV40 itself or SV40-contaminated polio vaccine causes (or has caused) cancer.
But even if the claim about the CDC's hiding evidence of a link between polio vaccine and cancer held water, the short lead-in paragraph quoted above contains a number of credibility-related red flags regarding the CDC's supposedly assuming its role as the perpetual villain of the anti-vaccine movement. America is not the world, and there's no plausible reason to believe that the rest of the planet would be fleeced by one country's public health authorities engaging in a conspiracy to deceive its people about vaccines. 






Moreover, the claim that the CDC had ""quickly,"" ""quietly,"" or ""recently"" redacted the information about a vaccine-cancer linkage was not new in October 2015, as iterations of it had appeared as early as July 2013. At that time Health Impact News published an article headlined ""CDC 'Disappears' Page Linking Polio Vaccines to Cancer-Causing Viruses,"" and InfoWars' similar ""CDC Sends Fact Sheet Linking Polio Vaccine to Cancer Down the Memory Hole"" story reported:
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention website curiously deleted pages admitting that the polio vaccine administered from 1955 to 1963 to over 98 million Americans was contaminated with a primate form of cancer virus.
Other CDC web pages also referencing the link between the widely-distributed vaccine and cancer have similarly been discarded.
That instance of the rumor claimed the pages had recently been deleted from Google's cache, but the site linked to archived version of the pages in question here and here.
The first link was titled ""Cancer, Simian Virus 40 (SV40), and Polio Vaccine Fact Sheet"" and was dated 22 October 2007. If it was (ostensibly) deleted ""quickly"" and ""quietly"" by the CDC as some sort of a cover-up in 2013, that would mean it still sat openly available for viewing by all and sundry online for roughly six years. The second link was titled ""Frequently Asked Questions about Cancer, Simian Virus 40 (SV40), and Polio Vaccine"" and contained such clearly damning ""admissions"" as:
All of the evidence to date indicates that after 1963, all vaccines on the U.S. market were free of SV40.
The majority of evidence suggests there is no causal relationship between receipt of SV40-contaminated polio vaccine and cancer development; however, some research results in this area are conflicting and more studies are needed. Since the discovery of SV40, several studies have been done to compare cancer rates in groups of individuals known or strongly presumed to have received SV40-contaminated polio vaccine to rates in persons known or strongly presumed not to have received SV40-contaminated vaccine.
In summary, the majority of studies in the U.S. and Europe that compare persons known or strongly presumed to have received SV40-contaminated polio vaccine with those known or strongly presumed not to have received SV40-contaminated polio vaccine have not shown a causal relationship between receipt of SV40-contaminated polio vaccine and cancer. It should be noted, however, that SV40 infection has been found in persons who did not receive SV40-contaminated polio vaccine and that for some study participants it cannot be known with certainty whether or not they received SV40-contaminated vaccine. Because of this, there may be errors in these studies that make it harder to detect a true increased cancer risk associated with receipt of SV40-contaminated polio vaccine.
It should be noted that the study of SV40 with respect to cancer and polio vaccines is neither novel nor has in any way been suppressed: as the quoted portion above explained, the concern was identified and addressed prior to 1963. A 2001 study indicated that ""large epidemiologic studies have not identified an elevated cancer risk in persons who received SV40-contaminated vaccines [administered before 1963]"" and found ""no deaths due to tumors of the types putatively associated with SV40."" The findings were described in that research as ""consistent with other negative epidemiologic investigations of risks from SV40-contaminated vaccines,"" although further research was recommended. Research published in 2004 echoed those findings:
Although SV40 causes cancer in laboratory animals, substantial epidemiological evidence has accumulated to indicate that SV40 likely does not cause cancer in humans. However, additional laboratory research is needed to better define methods for SV40 detection, as laboratory studies looking for SV40 DNA in human tumors have offered conflicting results. There is also a need to conduct additional studies evaluating cancer patients and controls for antibodies to SV40, which would be present in cancer patients if SV40 causes cancer.
Nonetheless, anti-vaccine blogs and sites continually assert that the CDC has ""admitted"" or covered up information in a manner that relies on a relative lack of context on the part of the reader to spread. In this case, the rumor relied on the reader not knowing that SV40 concerns were well documented in medical literature and long considered resolved. By the same token, redaction conspiracies are primed to circulate in perpetuity each time the CDC is accused of newly ""burying"" information in a manner not immediately verifiable by site visitors (i.e., it's difficult to corroborate information that has purportedly been deleted). But concern over SV40 and vaccines was addressed and dealt with by 1963, 50 years prior to the 2013 outbreak of the rumor. It was hardly an assertion revealed only by alternative health sites' crafty usage of Google caching, and a multitude of studies combed through subsequent cancer rates to identify subsequent elevated risk. None was found, a fact which also was no secret and was long-documented.
Moreover, the web documents the CDC was breathlessly accused of deleting were clearly marked ""Last Updated: 22 October 2007,"" while cover-up accusations dated to July 2013. Far likelier than a conspiracy was the fact that the pages were last relevant and useful in October 2007, and they've since been replaced with updated information hosted on separate pages at CDC.gov. In fact, a search for SV40, polio, and cancer on the CDC web site returns a number of related links to CDC pages, inconsistent with claims the CDC has ""disappeared"" such information (rather than replaced it with more current data). The cached pages linked above still lead to dated information on CDC.gov, but none of it meaningfully conflicts with more up-to-date information about long-retired vaccine strains.

In the aftermath of U.S. Election Day 2020, amid widespread, unsubstantiated conspiracy theories and allegations of electoral fraud, figures from the reelection campaign of U.S. President Donald Trump promoted content that was presented as proof of electoral fraud in Fulton County, Georgia.
On Nov. 4, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, sons of the president and prominent campaign surrogates, both promoted a video that, according to its narrator, was definitive proof of ""voter fraud."" The original video was tweeted out by Austin Fletcher, a right-wing online activist who uses the moniker ""Fleccas"":

The 34-second video clip appears to show a vote-count worker, claimed by Fletcher to be located in ""ATL"" (Atlanta, Georgia), gesticulating at his desk. It's not clear whether the voice narrating the video is Fletcher's, but the narrator says:
""I wonder what's going on here. This dude has a fit about something. And then flips off a ballot, and then crumples it up. If that's not voter fraud, I don't know what is."" 






The clip was taken from USA Today's YouTube live video stream of ongoing counts in various states and does indeed show a count worker in Atlanta, as the following screenshot demonstrates:

The worker in question appeared to have been rather expressive and engaged in a variety of gesticulations while doing his work, as the following video shows:



While the narrator of the viral video presented it as definitive proof of electoral fraud (""If that's not voter fraud, I don't know what is""), other eminently plausible explanations existed for the count worker's actions and non-verbal gestures. 
Firstly, it cannot be determined based on the video that the piece of paper the count worker crumpled up was a ballot.
Secondly, the narrator's suggestion is that the count worker expressed anger or frustration in the video, and that this was linked to his personal political views and came in response to the contents of a ballot or ballots (that is, the candidate chosen in certain ballots). That, too, cannot be determined from watching the video. 
For example, if the worker was expressing frustration (and that is not clear from the video), it could well have been related to his execution of a specific task, rather than a politically motivated response. That is, he may have lost a count, for example, or he may have realized he had more ballots to check or count than he originally assumed, or any number of potential, apolitical, and innocuous causes for frustration or dismay. 
According to a statement read at a Nov. 6 press conference by Fulton County Elections Director Richard Barron, what the poll worker was seen discarding was, in point of fact, a sheet of instructions that had been left in the ballot envelope by a voter.
""Voters often include lists of instructions like the one discarded in the primary absentee ballot envelope when submitting their ballots in the mail and or drop boxes,"" Barron said. The poll worker occupied a station where the envelopes are separated and cut; the ballots are extracted elsewhere, he explained. ""At no time was the worker able to extract a ballot.""
Barron said the incident was witnessed by a state election board monitor, and his office had conducted a review of the video. The poll worker did nothing wrong. Even so, the worker had to go into hiding after receiving threats of violence when the video went viral.

12.IsMorganFreemanReall,"
A bizarre conspiracy theory holding that U.S. musician Jimi Hendrix faked his death in 1970 and is now living as renown actor Morgan Freeman is frequently shared on social media. For instance, Newspunch, a website that has repeatedly trafficked in this sort of misinformation, published an article entitled ""Morgan Freeman is Jimi Hendrix, Researchers Claim"" in May 2018, stating:
Jimi Hendrix reinvented himself as actor Morgan Freeman in the 1970's, shortly after faking his own death, researchers claim.
According to internet sleuths, Morgan Freeman's sudden rise to fame in the 1970's occurred after Hendrix supposedly died on September 18, 1970.
Newspunch later updated the intro and title of this article to make it clear that this rumor originated with conspiracy theorists and not ""researchers"": 
We have updated the headline and opening of the article to make it clear that while the theory that Jimi Hendrix and Morgan Freeman are the same person is entertaining, it is extremely unlikely to be true.
The idea that Freeman is actually Hendrix is largely based on three claims: Freeman and Hendrix are both fans of music; Freeman and Hendrix look alike; and Freeman's acting career didn't take off until after Hendrix' death in 1970. 






While the first two claims may be accurate, they are also not especially convincing. After all, Freeman and Hendrix are far from the only people who enjoy music. Freeman does own a blues bar in Mississippi, but if liking blues music is the threshold for evidence, it's equally likely that Freeman is actually Robert Johnson, Howlin' Wolf, Freddie King, Little Walter, Big Bill Broonzy, Mississippi John Hurt, T-Bone Walker, or any other famous, deceased blues musician.
Freeman's appreciation for blues music probably speaks more to his upbringing in Memphis, Tennessee, and Chicago, Illinois, than it does to the claim that Freeman is actually a deceased musician. 
Freeman and Hendrix also do bare a passing resemblance to one another:

However, many of the image comparisons accompanying this rumor border on parody. The website WellAware1, for instance, attempted to draw a definitive link between Freeman and Hendrix based on the wrinkles seen in two photographs taken decades apart:

Scribbling lines onto a photograph does not constitute evidence.
The final claim, holding that Freeman's career didn't begin until after Hendrix's death, is inaccurate.  






Hendrix died on Sept. 18, 1970. A post-mortem examination found that Hendrix died of ""suffocation due to barbiturate intoxication."" A newspaper clipping on Hendrix' death can be found below:
 Tue, Sep 29, 1970 - 78 * Chicago Tribune (Chicago, Illinois) * Newspapers.com
While Freeman was not a household name at the time of Hendrix's death, his acting career began prior to 1970. Morgan's first onscreen appearance came in 1964 in a non-credited role in the Sidney Lumet movie ""The Pawnbroker."" Freeman also appeared in at least four stage productions, including ""Hello, Dolly!,"" ""The Dozen,"" and ""Exhibition,"" prior to Hendrix's death. Here's a newspaper clipping from 1969 featuring an unflattering review of ""The Dozens"" published in The Herald-News:
 Fri, Mar 14, 1969 - 50 * The Herald-News (Passaic, New Jersey) * Newspapers.com
It seems a bit implausible that Hendrix was moonlighting as an actor at the same time he was performing as a musician just so that he could fake his death and pursue a career in the movies.

365.ManyMarchforOurLives,"
Maddie King, who survived a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida that left 17 people dead, called on politicians to care more about their children than their guns.
David Hogg, a Stoneman Douglas student and frequent whipping boy of gun rights advocates, said politicians should get their resumes ready.
Another Stoneman Douglas student, Cameron Kasky, warned politicians who oppose stricter gun laws.
""Either represent the people or get out. Stand for us or beware: The voters are coming,"" Kasky said.
Thousands of Americans gathered in streets around the United States on March 24 to honor victims of gun violence and, generally speaking, to advocate for stricter gun laws.
According to a North Carolina legislator, some March For Our Lives speakers also called for a far more nefarious approach. State Rep. Beverly Boswell, a Republican from the coast, suggested on her Facebook page that speakers at the marches expressed violent intentions.
""Many of the speakers at these rallies were calling for gun registration, confiscation, Second Amendment repeal and even the murder of those who would not turn over their guns to the government,"" Boswell wrote on her campaign Facebook page.

Murder? That seems harsh.
Boswell, who's in her first term representing House DIstrict 6, has been an open critic of efforts to toughen gun laws. She recently referred to students who participated in the national school walkout as ""Tide pod"" eaters and boasted on Facebook about confronting a school leader who held an assembly on that day -- which he says was simply to honor the victims of Parkland shooting.
She was also recently scolded by the North Carolina Board of Nursing for misrepresenting herself as a nurse.
Boswell's comments about March For Our Lives were part of a side conversation on her Facebook page after she posted a photo of some students with the caption, ""They're out to take your guns, and our freedoms,"" at 8:10 p.m. on March 26. On March 27, she posted the comments about the march speakers after someone suggested Boswell's original post was a ""scare tactic"" meant to distract people from the message of the march.
What the 'march' wants
The March For Our Lives website doesn't say anything about forcefully taking guns from gun owners, much less harming them.
The organization says it wants universal, comprehensive background checks and a digitized, searchable database of guns at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (known as ATF). It also wants bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as funds for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to research gun violence.
March For Our Lives has the support of several large, liberal organizing groups that support gun control. And a survey of the Washington marchers found that protesters there were largely liberal, with 79 percent of those who were randomly surveyed identifying as ""left-leaning.""
But the group doesn't appear to have ties to groups with a history of advocating violence. PolitiFact recently debunked a claim by the National Rifle Association that the March For Our Lives is ""backed by radicals with a history of violent threats, language and actions.""
A story by Variety.com captured some of the marchers' public disdain for the NRA, but none of the views expressed included calls for violence.

""A video during the [Washington] event showed NRA officials, like Wayne LaPierre and Dana Loesch, as well as [the late actor] Charlton Heston, then the president of the organization, saying, 'From my cold dead hands.' In the crowd the images drew boos and the bird,"" Variety reported.
In New York City, ""Marchers chanted 'NRA sashay away,' at the New York rally, holding posters decrying the involvement of the National Rifle Association in government,"" Variety reported.
PolitiFact emailed Boswell and asked if she could provide videos or news clips showing march speakers advocating violence. Luke Stancil, her campaign spokesman, responded by referencing a candidate for sheriff in North Carolina who joked about taking people's guns. 
Daryl Fisher, a candidate running for sheriff of Buncombe County in western NC, explained his views of people who invite him to pry their gun from their cold, bare hands. Stancil pointed out that Fisher shrugged said, ""OK ... Whenever you pass away, we'll come get it.""
Fisher indeed said those things. But he didn't say them at a March For Our Lives rally. He later apologized. And Boswell said ""many"" speakers called for the murder of gun owners - and didn't cite any others. 
So we searched for evidence of violent rhetoric ourselves.
What speakers said
Alex Jones, a conservative conspiracy theorist who runs InfoWars.com, said on his show that marchers declared they would ""kill anyone"" who doesn't turn in their guns.
But PolitiFact found no credible evidence of rally speakers calling for violence against gun owners who might refuse to relinquish their guns. Most speakers at the Washington march and other marches across the country spoke about stricter gun laws and warned politicians of forthcoming punishment at the ballot box.
Some of those comments, if taken out of context, could be misconstrued as threats. Delaney Tarr, a frequently-interviewed Stoneman Douglas student, said the Washington marchers are ""are here to call out every single politician. We will take action where it counts.""
Those comments were preceded by a specific list of legislative demands that included an assault weapons ban, the ""prohibition of high capacity magazines, reinforcement of background checks and closing of loopholes.""
In that vein, she said: ""When they give us that inch, that bump stock ban, we will take a mile.""
Alex Wind, a junior at Stoneman Douglas, used the words ""life"" and ""death"" to describe where politicians stand on gun restrictions.
""To all the politicians out there, if you take money from the NRA, you have chosen death,"" Wind said. ""If you have not expressed to your constituents a public stance on this issue, you have chosen death. If you do not stand with us by saying we need to pass common sense gun legislation, you have chosen death. And none of the millions of people marching in this country today will stop until they see those against us out of office, because we choose life.""
D'Angelo McDade, a student from North Lawndale College Prep in Chicago and members of the student non-violence group the Peace Warriors, specifically called for non-violent action.
""When will we as a nation understand that we are not here to fight against one another and we are here to fight for life and peace?"" McDade said. ""Dr. King once said, 'Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.' Which now leads me to say that violence cannot drive out violence, only peace can do that.""
Speakers at marches in Boswell's home state of North Carolina were similar. Speakers in Raleigh, Durham, Charlotte, Greensboro and Asheville reportedly focused on gun laws and the NRA.
Our ruling
Boswell said ""many speakers"" at the March for Our Lives rallies were calling for ""the murder of those who would not turn over their guns to the government."" She didn't provide any evidence to back up her claim, and PolitiFact found no evidence. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

By mid-May 2021, more than one-third of Americans were fully vaccinated to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Meanwhile, anti-vaccine groups accelerated their sensational and often factually vulnerable campaigns to try to stop the remaining population from accepting the shots.
Those efforts often repeated unfounded conspiracy theories that COVID-19 vaccine administrators were secretly inoculating people with miniature devices to actively track their locations or to connect 5G broadband cellular networks. For example, as of this writing, social media users were circulating a handful of videos allegedly showing magnets sticking to vaccine patients' arms, which some framed as evidence of the ""microchip"" scheme.
For example, one viral video (a screenshot of which is displayed below) showed a woman in a tank top placing an item about the size of a coin on her upper left bicep to purportedly reveal an under-skin magnetic force.
""WE'RE CHIPPED AND WE'RE ALL FUCKED!"" a Facebook caption read. ""Magnet appears to stick to embedded chip following shot.""

Other footage -- including a TikTok video supposedly featuring a ""Baby Yoda"" (aka ""Grogu"") magnet sticking to a vaccine recipient's arm -- circulated widely around the same time. TikTok eventually removed that clip, and other social media sites such as Instagram and Facebook placed content warnings on similar videos to avoid confusing people about the real effects of the innoculations.
The underlying claim was false. Regardless of the brand (such as Pfizer, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson), no COVID-19 vaccine contains radio-frequency identification chips or other types of magnetic devices as part of a nefarious plan to implant people with technology against their will. That said, below, we lay out what likely happened in the videos ostensibly showing magnets stuck on people's arms. 






First, though, we reached out to the apparent creator of the video featuring the Baby Yoda magnet, as well as several other social media accounts that promoted the theory, to learn their motivations for sharing the content. We have not received any responses yet, but we will update this report when, or if, that changes.
In other words, we did not have the answers to questions regarding the alleged magnets in the videos. Specifically, were they actually little items made of materials such as iron, steel, nickel that attracted other magnets? It was unknown.
It is also worth mentioning that no proof was offered in the videos that the objects were magnets or that the people depicted had actually received a COVID-19 vaccine.
Next, we considered a hypothetical: What would human skin do, or look like, if a magnetic object existed underneath it?
Reuters published the below-displayed photograph in 2011 showing the force of a magnet lifting the skin of someone who had a metallic object inside them. Dr. Robert Brodell, who co-authored a study exploring the question at the time, described the image as the skin creating a ""tent"" upward toward the magnet.

No one depicted in the popular videos about COVID-19 vaccines seemingly had their skin ""tent"" like the above-displayed photograph -- at least based on the angles from which those clips were recorded.
Next, we considered another theoretical scenario based on the conspiracy theory's premise. If the shots included metallic ingredients to create a magnetic pull, wouldn't people who are allergic to those materials endure physical reactions, such as itchy, blistering, or dry skin?
According to a study of metal allergies published in the National Library of Medicine, scientists estimated that up to 17% of all women and 3% of men are allergic to nickel, while a smaller percentage is allergic to cobalt and chromium.
Based on those estimates -- and if, hypothetically speaking, the vaccines included metallic ingredients -- a sizable proportion of vaccine recipients would report rashes or skin irritations. That, however, was not the case, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) list of common possible side effects.
Lastly, to fully substantiate our conclusion, we considered the ingredients of COVID-19 vaccines, which are listed and approved by the Federal Drug Administration (Pfizer here, Moderna here, and Johnson & Johnson here. Also, here's a helpful explainer of the Pfizer vaccine's ingredients by MIT Technology Review, as well as a breakdown by the New Jersey-based Hackensack Meridian Health.)
We and experts concluded no COVID-19 vaccine formulas included metal ingredients or any amount of biological material required to do what the videos alleged. For example, Edward Hutchinson, a lecturer with the Centre for Virus Research at Scotland's University of Glasgow, told us via email:
""[You] would need to introduce a large lump of magnetic material beneath the skin to get the action through the skin that the videos claim to show (if you want to give this a go, try getting a fridge magnet to pick up anything, particularly tiny bits of metal, through the skin between your thumb and index finger).""
Furthermore, Al Edwards, an associate professor in biomedical technology from the University of Reading in England, said the human body is comprised of the same type of biological materials in the vaccine formulas. 
""There is nothing magnetic in vaccine formulations, most of what is injected is extremely pure water, plus some simple salts to make the injection less painful, and an absolutely tiny amount of vaccine,"" he wrote Snopes. ""Most food is made of similar molecules, and eating food doesn't make people magnetic.""
In sum, while the videos did not depict authentic effects of COVID-19 vaccines, the reasons for why the alleged ""magnets"" seemingly stayed on people's arms were unclear. More plausible than the microchip conspiracy theory were the possibilities that people positioned their arms in away to avoid the items' gravitational pull downwards or used items that stuck to people's skin for reasons other than a magnetic pull. For those reasons, we rate this claim ""False.""

10.PresidentsClubAssemb,"
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The death of George H.W. Bush is bringing together the five remaining members of an oh-so-exclusive fraternity -- the presidents club. But for President Donald Trump, it may not be an entirely comfortable reunion, throwing him together with former occupants of the Oval Office who have given him decidedly mixed reviews.
Wednesday's state funeral for the late president will be attended by ""formers"" Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. The last time they were together with Trump was at his inauguration in 2017. Recalling the funerals for Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan, they will all sit together in Washington National Cathedral, with the exception of the younger Bush, who will be seated nearby with his family.
Those who have occupied the Oval Office share an unparalleled experience that typically builds a special camaraderie. And by virtue of health, longevity and opportunities for continued influence, ex-presidents are sticking around longer than ever and staying active in the public eye.
But since taking office, Trump has had little contact with his predecessors. He has not spoken to Democrats Clinton or Obama since his inauguration. He did speak with the younger Bush during the contentious confirmation process for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, as the previous Republican president helped lobby for his former aide. Democrat Carter has been briefed by White House officials on North Korea, though it was not clear if he has engaged directly with Trump.
Trump has sought to meet the elder Bush's passing with grace, a contrast to the rhythms of much of his tumultuous presidency. He came to office after a campaign in which he harshly criticized his Democratic predecessors and co-opted a Republican Party once dominated by the Bush family. Despite the traditional kinship among presidents, Trump's predecessors have all made their discomfort known in different ways. 






""It's unusual that a cabal of ex-presidents from both parties dislike a sitting president and that's what you've got happening right now,"" said Douglas Brinkley, a history professor at Rice University.
Past presidents often built relationships with their predecessors, Brinkley said. ""Bill Clinton would reach out to Richard Nixon for advice on Russia,"" he said. ""Harry Truman leaned heavily on Herbert Hoover. It's endless.""
To be sure, Brinkley added, those ties vary from president to president and there have been chilly relationships as well, noting, for example, that ""FDR would never talk to Herbert Hoover.""
Busy with a mix of personal pursuits, charitable endeavors -- and, in some cases, paid speaking gigs -- the former leaders don't mingle very often, making a funeral in their group a big occasion. Bonded by the presidency, they tend to exercise caution in their comments about each other. Still, all the living former presidents have aimed barbs -- directly or indirectly -- at Trump.
In a speech in September, Obama slammed the ""crazy stuff"" coming out of the White House without directly naming Trump. Last year, the younger Bush made a speech that confronted many of the themes of Trump's presidency without mentioning him by name, cautioning that ""bigotry seems emboldened"" and the nation's politics ""seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication.""
Over the summer, Carter told The Washington Post that Trump's presidency was a ""disaster."" And Clinton -- stung by Trump's defeat of wife Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race -- told a weekly newspaper in New York state after her stunning loss that Trump ""doesn't know much.""
Even the late Bush's feelings about Trump were harsh at times. In Mark K. Updegrove's book ""The Last Republicans,"" published last year, the elder Bush called Trump a ""blowhard.""
The late Bush said he voted for Clinton in 2016 while George W. Bush said he voted for ""none of the above."" 






There have been other moments when the ex-presidents offered more sympathetic sentiments for Trump. After Trump's surprise victory, Obama stood in the Rose Garden at the White House and said he was ""rooting"" for the next president. Carter told The New York Times in 2017 that the media had been harder on Trump than other presidents. Clinton said in June that America should be rooting for Trump to succeed in his North Korea talks.
While he has struggled to set the right tone in past moments of national grief, Trump has gone out of his way to address Bush's passing with consideration, issuing kind statements and ensuring that Bush family members have whatever they need for the funeral. On Tuesday, first lady Melania Trump welcomed Laura Bush and other family members for a tour of the White House Christmas decorations. And Trump and the first lady visited with members of the Bush family at Blair House.
Jim McGrath, a spokesman for the late president, tweeted thanks to Trump for his efforts, praising the president and the first lady, as well as White House staff and Congress leadership ""for their amazing support as we attempt to give this great and good man the send-off he surely deserves.""
Brinkley said that presidential funerals tend to be civil occasions, even after political strain.
After all, he said, ""Bill and Hillary were at Nixon's funeral and Hillary worked to impeach him.""

153.Disinformationtarget,"
Mitt Romney and the few other Republican lawmakers who have spoken out against Trump lately have become the targets of disinformation on social media. False Facebook posts and tweets about federal and local lawmakers who broke the party line have been shared thousands of times, with some talking points making their way onto radio and TV programs, too. 
Romney has called Trump's actions regarding Ukraine ""deeply troubling."" He called Trump's urging of China to investigate his rival Joe Biden ""wrong and appalling."" 
Those statements prompted several false attacks against Romney. One viral tweet that spread rapidly on Facebook falsely claimed that Romney's son also worked for a Ukrainian oil company. The goal: sow doubt about Romney's true intentions for speaking out against Trump.
Other attacks falsely claim the dissenting conservatives have voted in favor of impeaching Trump -- even though no vote has been taken -- while others try to implicate them in sham corruption scandals.
For Republicans, the choice on social media is clear: support the president or get smeared. 
Romney implicated in Ukraine conspiracy
Two days after Romney, R-Utah, tweeted about Trump's appeal to China, false claims about the senator started circulating on social media.
In a tweet published Oct. 6, Jack Murphy, co-founder of conservative news site TrendingPolitics.com, falsely claimed that one of the senator's five sons does business in Ukraine. He made the same wrong allegation about the children of Biden, Pelosi and former Secretary of State John Kerry.
""Biden's son, Pelosi's son, Romney's son, Kerry's son,"" he said in the tweet, which has since been deleted. ""All are on the board of directors for energy companies doing business in Ukraine... Coincidence? No.""
Only Biden's son, Hunter, served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, named Burisma, from 2014 to spring 2019. Burisma appointed Hunter Biden to its board of directors to help the company improve its corporate governance and adopt Western-style transparency. 
His father, the former vice president and Democratic candidate running for president in 2020, has faced criticism for the appointment over a conflict of interest -- particularly from Trump and his allies, who have tried to use it as a response to the impeachment inquiry.

(Screenshot from Facebook)
We found no evidence that any of Pelosi, Romney or Kerry's sons have held similar positions. But Murphy's claim took off, racking up tens of thousands of faves and retweets. (We asked him for his sources, but he didn't respond.)
Soon, the tweet made its way to Facebook.
One popular post published Oct. 6 included a screenshot of Murphy's post with the caption ""probably needs to be investigated."" It was shared more than 1,000 times and copied by several other Facebook posts.
The posts were flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Since they were published last month, false posts about Romney's involvement in Ukraine have been copied and repurposed. We found scores of other questionable or inaccurate posts on CrowdTangle, a tool that tracks social media. Some of them even explicitly mentioned Romney's criticism of Trump. We reached out to Romney's press office for comment on that effort, but we haven't heard back.
Experts told us this kind of disinformation is a common strategy to undermine a political message.
""This is an age-old tactic: undermine the critique by attacking the critic; attack the messenger, not the message,"" said Rebekah Tromble, an associate professor in the School of Media & Public Affairs at George Washington University, in an email. ""The specific reason for disliking Romney doesn't need to stick, as long as the general sense that he's tainted in some way remains. And there's a great deal of evidence to suggest that, especially when communicated through anger and fear, that generalized negative sentiment does stick with people.""
RELATED: The impeachment inquiry: What to expect from public hearings and beyond
It's still unclear what kind of impact this kind of disinformation has had on voters, but some experts said it could be effective in fooling social media users since it makes claims about a topic that isn't necessarily common knowledge.
""Misinformation tends to be more successful when people do not have existing prior knowledge on the topic,"" said Emily Vraga, an associate journalism professor at the University of Minnesota, in an email. ""Very few people likely know anything about the children of these political leaders; someone suggesting that they work for overseas companies is certainly plausible. If there isn't evidence to debunk it immediately apparent, it's possible that people would come to believe it is true.""
Counting votes before they hatch
Some Republicans in Congress, as well as state politicians, have faced similar smears for criticizing the president, or even if it was thought that they might criticize the president.
One Facebook post claimed four Republican lawmakers voted to impeach the president.
""Will Hurd, Fred Upton, Susan Brooks and Brian Fitzpatrick,"" read the post, which was later deleted. ""Remember these faces next election!""

(Screenshot from Facebook)
That post is False. 
The House did vote on whether to authorize a formal impeachment inquiry against Trump, but it hasn't voted on articles of impeachment. The resolution to start an inquiry passed in a 232-196 vote Oct. 31, and no Republicans voted for the measure.
 The House has not voted on whether to impeach Trump. That will happen after hearings conclude, and after articles of impeachment are drafted.
Why single out Reps. Hurd of Texas, Upton of Michigan, Brooks of Indiana and Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania? What they have in common is a vote for a measure criticizing Trump on a different subject.
In July, they were the only House Republicans who voted in favor of a resolution to rebuke the president's comments that four minority Democratic congresswomen should ""go back"" to their ancestral countries. We reached out to each of the lawmakers' press offices, but we haven't heard back.
RELATED: Viral post says Democrats spent $40 million on impeachment. That's False
""Today's resolution was targeted at the specific words that frankly are not acceptable from a leader in any work place large or small,"" Upton wrote in a July 16 Twitter thread. ""If we're going to bring civility back to the center of our politics, we must speak out against inflammatory rhetoric from anyone in any party anytime it happens.""
Brooks, Hurd and Fitzpatrick made similar statements of support for the resolution. Several posts from popular conservative pages attacked the lawmakers' decision to break with their party after they voted in favor of the resolution.
""Will Hurd (TX) Fred Upton (MI) Susan Brooks (IN) Brian Fitzpatrick (PA) Justin Amash [I](MI) They have made it clear they side with the Democrats,"" reads one post published July 16. ""These people should all be primaried before the 2020 general election.""
State politicians who speak ill of the president or in support of the impeachment inquiry have also been targeted by disinformation.
One Facebook post published Sept. 27 falsely claimed Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, ""just voted"" to impeach Trump. It was shared more than 5,000 times, and we found copycat posts elsewhere on Facebook.
It is wrong on several fronts.
First, a governor has no voting role in impeachment proceedings. Second, there hasn't been a vote to impeach Trump. And finally, the governor didn't even say Trump should be impeached.

(Screenshot from Facebook)
However, like Romney, Scott has spoken out in support of the House's impeachment investigation. 
""We have much more to learn and need to understand all the facts as this serious allegation is considered,"" he said in a statement to the Washington Post on Sept. 26. ""It appears Congress will be starting an inquiry process, which I believe is appropriate.""
The false post was published the day after Scott issued his statement. It took a step ahead of what Scott said about the inquiry to inaccurately claim that he ""just voted"" to impeach Trump, attracting the ire of conservatives on Facebook.
Experts told us that kind of disinformation could have a cooling effect on Republicans speaking out against the president or supporting the impeachment inquiry.
""If Republicans who express support for the impeachment investigation feel like they can't express those beliefs because they're afraid people will spread disinformation about them that could hurt their re-election chances, then that could increase the politicization of the impeachment process,"" said Emily Van Duyn, a postdoctoral fellow studying political communication at Stanford University, in an email. 
RELATED: Could Donald Trump be impeached, removed and run for re-election? It's possible
""In other words, if this disinformation strategy turns out to be a silencing tactic to keep Republicans in check, then it could make party-line support or opposition for the impeachment even stronger.""
However, that same effect might not carry over to everyday Americans. Some experts are doubtful that disinformation targeting Republicans will dramatically shift the way most voters view impeachment.
""For the majority of Americans, their opinion on whether Donald Trump should be impeached is likely quite strong, and this disinformation is tangential to the inquiry,"" Vraga said. ""For those who oppose impeachment, the disinformation justifies that President Trump's actions are fairly typical and do not merit impeachment. For those who support impeachment, they are likely to be skeptical of the disinformation.""

12.TrumpPraisesQAnonCon,"

WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Donald Trump on Wednesday praised the supporters of QAnon, a convoluted, pro-Trump conspiracy theory, and suggested he appreciates their support of his candidacy.
Speaking during a press conference at the White House, Trump courted the support of those who put stock in the conspiracy theory, saying, ""I heard that these are people that love our country."" It was Trump's first public comment on the subject and continued a pattern of president appearing unwilling to resoundingly condemn extremists who support his candidacy.
QAnon has ricocheted around the darker corners of the internet since late 2017, but has been creeping into mainstream politics more and more. The baseless theory centers on an alleged anonymous, high-ranking government official known as ""Q"" who shares information about an anti-Trump ""deep state"" often tied to satanism and child sex trafficking.
Trump insisted he hadn't heard much about the movement, ""other than I understand they like me very much"" and ""it is gaining in popularity.""
Trump has retweeted QAnon-promoting accounts, and shirts and hats with QAnon symbols and slogans are not uncommon at his rallies. 






An FBI bulletin last May warned that conspiracy theory-driven extremists have become a domestic terrorism threat. The bulletin specifically mentioned QAnon. Earlier last year, the Southern Poverty Law Center warned that the movement is becoming increasingly popular with anti-government extremists.



 
Trump's comments were condemned by the campaign of his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.
""After calling neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville 'fine people' and tear gassing peaceful protesters following the murder of George Floyd, Donald Trump just sought to legitimize a conspiracy theory that the FBI has identified as a domestic terrorism threat,"" said Biden spokesman Andrew Bates. ""Our country needs leadership that will bring us together more than ever to form a more perfect union. We have to win this battle for the soul of our nation.""
Pressed on QAnon theories that Trump is allegedly saving the nation from a satanic cult of child sex traffickers, Trump claimed ignorance, but asked, ""Is that supposed to be a bad thing?""
""If I can help save the world from problems, I'm willing to do it,"" Trump said.
Qanon supporters were quick to celebrate Trump's comments on social media, with many calling them a validation of their views. Many have long contended he sends them coded messages of support, and on Twitter, one user claimed Trump's choice of a pink tie on Wednesday was another signal of support.
Within minutes, dozens of Instagram users began celebrating Trump's acknowledgement of the conspiracy theory at the White House podium, uploading videos of him. 






""Well we've been waiting for this moment for a while, to put it mildly thank you @realDonaldTrump,"" one Instagram user wrote to her 19,000 followers in a post of Trump's exchange. The video was viewed more than 1,000 times in just 30 minutes.
""Holy Smokin Q,"" another tweeted. ""Our President was asked 2 questions about the Qanon movement TODAY!! We LOVE you President Trump.""
On Parler, a right-wing platform popular with some Trump supporters, one Qanon supporter posted a photo of Trump and a bald eagle.
Trump's comments came a week after he endorsed Marjorie Taylor Greene, who won her GOP House primary runoff in Georgia last week. Greene called the QAnon conspiracy theory ""something worth listening to and paying attention to"" and called Q a ""patriot."" Trump praised her as a ""future Republican Star.""
Trump has a long history of advancing false and sometimes racist conspiracies, including last week, when he gave credence to a highly criticized op-ed that questioned Democrat Kamala Harris' eligibility to serve as vice president even though she was born in Oakland, California.
Asked about the matter, Trump told reporters he had ""heard"" rumors that Harris, a Black woman and U.S.-born citizen whose parents were immigrants, does not meet the requirement to serve in the White House. The president said he considered the rumors ""very serious,"" but later he and his campaign indicated they were not making an issue of the claim. Constitutional lawyers have dismissed it as nonsense.
Facebook announced just hours before Trump's statements that it was banning some QAnon Facebook groups and accounts.
But social media had already been used for years to fuel the conspiracy theory's rise, with private and super-secret Facebook groups where members sometimes post hundreds of times a day. QAnon believers often peddle a number of conspiracy theories, from claims that John F. Kennedy Jr. isn't really dead and is staging a public comeback to baseless speculation around celebrities who have secretly been arrested for trafficking children for sex.
Mentions of hashtags social media users to promote the QAnon conspiracy theory have spiked in public Facebook pages and groups since July, generating millions of interactions, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from Facebook-owned CrowdTangle.
The conspiracy theory gained a larger online following in recent weeks, when prominent QAnon social media accounts pushed a bizarre and baseless conspiracy theory that online retail giant Wayfair was trafficking children through pricey storage cabinets that are for sale on its site. Some of the social media users shared the names and photos of missing children from around the country as proof of the scheme, even though many of the children have since been recovered.
Last month, researchers at online misinformation firm NewsGuard found that the QAnon conspiracy theory is gaining traction in Europe, with Facebook users pushing it on Facebook and Twitter, too.

94.DidRogerStoneSellHil,"
President Donald Trump's longtime adviser Roger Stone spent much of the 2016 presidential campaign launching attacks against the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. His website StoneColdTruth.com and associated social media accounts are filled with memes and doctored images that portray Clinton as old, sick, or in prison. Stone also frequently posted messages on Twitter calling for Clinton's imprisonment and even started a petition advocating her prosecution that he shared with the hashtag #lockherup.
So when Stone was indicted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on seven charges in January 2019, including obstruction of an official proceeding, witness tampering, and making false statements, a number of people took to social media to note the irony of his arrest. Some of those messages included a photograph of Stone holding a ""Hillary for Prison"" T-shirt:

We were unable to locate the original source of this image, the earliest version we could uncover being one included in a December 2015 article published on Vosizneias.com about Stone's joining a pro-Trump Super Pac:

Roger Stone, who publicly parted ways with Trump's campaign in August, says he is supporting the Committee To Restore America's Greatness, which first filed paperwork with federal regulators in October.
""I just really think this is something that needs to be done,"" said Stone, who has known Trump for decades and remained a vocal supporter, even after he left the campaign.

The image appears to be authentic and was likely created to promote merchandise sold via the Infowars conspiracy theory website.  Stone sold a similar version of this shirt on his own website, Stone Cold Truth, accompanied by the caption ""Wear them loud, wear them proud and help get the word out that all of these globalist criminals, Republican and Democrat alike, should be held accountable for their crimes.""
A federal magistrate judge on Friday ruled that longtime GOP operative and President Trump associate Roger Stone is not a flight risk and can be released on a $250,000 signature bond.
Roger Stone vended ""Hillary for Prison"" merchandise, promoted the #lockherup hashtag, and circulated a petition calling for prosecution of the former U.S. secretary of state. However, in January 2019 it was Stone, not Clinton, who was indicted by federal prosecutors.

In May 2021, Snopes received multiple inquiries from readers asking us to examine the accuracy and authenticity of a widely-shared video which claimed that Hindus in India had been throwing away the idols of their faith, in a gesture of anger and despair at their supposed failure to protect them from a devastating surge in COVID-19 infections and fatalities, in the spring of 2021.
The video consisted of a one-minute news segment read in a studio by an anchor speaking English and bore the chyron ""Idols thrown on the street."" In the top-right corner of the screen the words ""Imam Hussein"" could be seen, while the bottom-left corner read ""Shia Waves: Shia World News."" The segment contained two pieces of footage: an excavator clearing piles of idols, and idols being thrown from the back of a flat-bed truck into a body of water. 
The text of the segment was as follows:
A large number of Indians have thrown the idols of the gods they worship on the streets, as the numbers of coronavirus infections and deaths skyrocket in the country. Indians expressed their anger at the idols that they worshipped and sacrificed themselves for, while the idols did not protect them from the coronavirus. They pray to the idols because they believe that it could save them from the virus, but they finally discovered that they could not do anything, and hence they destroyed it [sic]...
Readers also asked Snopes about an article on the website ShiaWaves.com, which contained the same set of claims as the video. 
The video and accompanying article were no more than insidious anti-Hindu propaganda; and the two pieces of footage the video relied upon were wrenched from their original context, which dated to before the COVID-19 pandemic and had no connection with it. We are issuing a rating of ""False.""
In recent years, misinformation -- primarily driven by online social networks and WhatsApp -- has been rife in India. The arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 combined with existing religious and class-based divisions to create a maelstrom of inflammatory conspiracy theories and rumors, many of them targeting India's large Muslim minority.  






What the Shia Waves Video Actually Shows
The widely-shared video appears to have first emerged online in May 2021 and was broadcast on Imam Hussein TV, a multinational television network which supports the Iraqi-Iranian Shia Muslim cleric Sadiq al-Shirazi. Imam Hussein TV, the website ShiaWaves.com, and the television station Shia Waves, are all owned and operated by the Imam Hussein Media Group. Imam Hussein TV broadcasts in the United States, among many other countries, via mobile apps and OTT (over-the-top) devices such as the Roku player.
We could find no record of the ""idols"" segment on any of the Shia Waves or Imam Hussein TV social media accounts, which suggests it has either been deleted, or it was recorded from a live online stream by a third party, and subsequently re-uploaded to social media. The text of the segment read out in the video is identical to the text of the article published on ShiaWaves.com, which we know to be formally affiliated with Imam Hussein TV. Therefore, little doubt exists as to the authenticity of the video segment, and the authorship of Imam Hussein TV. 
As originally reported by the Indian fact-checking website BOOM Live, the first piece of footage shown in the segment actually originated at least six months before the COVID-19 pandemic, and its narrative framing by Imam Hussein TV/Shia Waves was therefore inaccurate and grossly misleading.
In August 2019, Vijay Nehra, then a prominent municipal official in the city of Ahmedabad, in the north-western Indian province of Gujarat, tweeted out photographs of the aftermath of a festival in honor of the Hindu goddess Dashama. The pictures showed idols strewn along the banks of the Sabarmati river, of which Nehra remarked approvingly: ""Instead of immersing Dashama idols in the river, they have respectfully left them on the banks!! Thousands and Thousands of them. Unbelievable change.""

At the conclusion of multi-day festivals honoring various Hindu deities, it is customary to immerse idols in water before disposing of them. Historically, this has been done by immersing the idols in rivers and lakes, but in recent years, concerns over water pollution have prompted efforts to discourage the practice, and find alternative ways to honor the immersion ritual. 
In response to Nehra's tweet, Sagar Savaliya, a journalist in the state of Gujarat, posted a video that appeared to show an excavator disposing of idols that had been left by the banks of a river -- the same footage later contained in the viral Imam Hussein TV/Shia Waves video:

It's not clear exactly when and where Savaliya's video was recorded, but the fact that it was posted in August 2019 means it could not possibly have any connection with the subsequent COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore does not illustrate what Imam Hussein TV/Shia Waves claimed. Far from showing Hindus in the act of abandoning or rejecting their faith, it almost certainly shows the aftermath of a festival of devotion to a Hindu deity.
The second piece of footage used in the May 2021 video was potentially even older than the first, and also bore no relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. As originally reported by Agence France-Presse in May 2020, the footage actually showed idols being tipped from the back of a truck into the Krishna river in the state of Telangana in 2015, as part of the immersion ceremony at the conclusion of a festival in honor of the Hindu god Ganesh.
The footage used by Imam Hussein TV/Shia Waves was posted to Facebook as early as September 2015, as shown in the comparison below:
Once again, the footage could not possibly have had any connection to the COVID-19 pandemic, and showed the ritual of immersion being followed after a festival in honor of a Hindu god, rather than being an illustration of Indian Hindus abandoning their faith en masse. 
The ShiaWaves.com article that accompanied the television segment also contained a photograph that was presented as evidence of the same supposed large-scale abandonment of religious faith by Hindus in India:

Although we have not yet been able to pinpoint the exact origins of that particular photograph, it almost certainly shows the ritual of immersion at the culmination of a festival in honor of the goddess Durga. 
Finally, it's worth noting that although the May 2021 video and article constituted anti-Hindu propaganda created by a Shia Muslim media network, they were also shared enthusiastically by some Christians, who appeared to revel in the (fictional) mass abandonment of faith among India's Hindus.

99.FederalagentsdirectlyincitedpeopleonJan62021andintentionallyentrappedAmericancitizens,"
A debunked conspiracy theory that claims federal agents incited the Jan. 6 Capitol riot is making a new appearance in Fox News host Tucker Carlson's new three-part documentary series, ""Patriot Purge.""
The controversial series that started airing Nov. 1 attempts to frame the insurrection as a false flag arranged by the federal government to ensnare American citizens who supported former President Donald Trump. The video is available on Fox News' subscription-based streaming service ""Fox Nation,"" but it's not being aired on the Fox News channel.
""Most Americans probably assume the chaos on Jan. 6 was the result of intelligence failures or of simple government incompetence. But direct incitement by federal agents? The intentional entrapment of American citizens? No decent person wants to believe that. But increasingly there's evidence it is true,"" Carlson claimed at the close of the first segment.
Carlson is wrong. There is no credible evidence behind this theory, and Carlson's piece doesn't present any. PolitiFact reached out to Fox News but did not hear back. The FBI declined to comment.
The film's claims
The first time we saw this claim from Carlson, he based it on reporting by Revolver News, a right-leaning website. In a June 14 article, headlined, ""Unindicted Co-Conspirators in 1/6 Cases Raise Disturbing Questions of Federal Foreknowledge,"" Revolver speculated that because there were unindicted, unnamed co-conspirators included in some of the Capitol rioters' federal charging documents, it was reasonable to assume that those people are FBI informants or agents.
Carlson returned to Revolver as a source for his documentary series, interviewing Darren Beattie, who runs Revolver News and is a former Trump White House speechwriter who was fired in 2018 after he appeared on a panel with a white nationalist. In the video, Beattie made conspiratorial claims connecting the foiled October 2020 plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to the notion that the FBI orchestrated the insurrection, because informants and undercover FBI operatives were involved.
Beattie referenced Steven D'Antuono, the former director of the Detroit FBI field office, who was promoted to help lead the FBI's Washington, D.C., office after his team successfully thwarted the Whitmer kidnapping. D'Antuono is now working on the Capitol riot cases. The film suggested this is suspicious, and Beattie reiterated his website's reporting that D'Antuono was ""quietly"" promoted. The suggestion ignores that the FBI issued a press release about the news and local media wrote stories about it.
The comparison between Jan. 6 and the Whitmer plot is fraught. The plan in Michigan was never carried out, as is the case with most schemes that involve undercover agents and result in criminal charges. 
Carlson cites reporting from journalist Trevor Aaronson on FBI stings that were used to to entrap Muslims after 9/11 to support his theory that the same was done to Trump supporters at the Capitol. But back in June, when Carlson first used Aaronson's research in one of his segments, Aaronson responded in an article and said the Fox News host distorted his reporting.
""While it is true that the FBI has since 9/11 set up hundreds of Muslims in counterterrorism stings, providing weapons and sometimes the ideas for plots, I have seen zero evidence to suggest that Jan. 6 was part of a plot engineered by the FBI,"" Aaronson told PolitiFact in an email. ""What's more, the scale of the Capitol riot, involving hundreds of people from all over the country, makes the suggestion that this was some FBI plot absolutely ludicrous."" 
Carlson also claimed that a former DEA agent, Mark Ibrahim, was ""strongly encouraged"" to go inside the Capitol building by an unnamed FBI informant friend who had invited him to the rally. Carlson presents no evidence for this, and court documents show the friend denied urging Ibrahim to go inside. The friend told investigators Ibrahim had concocted the story and went to the rally to promote himself after submitting an intent to resign from the DEA. The witness also told federal agents they were not at the Capitol in any formal capacity for the FBI. 
Meanwhile, Ibrahim wasn't indicted for ""simply being near the Capitol,"" as Carlson asserted in the series. Court documents show Ibrahim faces charges for bringing a firearm onto restricted grounds and for making false statements to federal agents.
Others who appeared in the series claimed that so-called ""professional agitators"" were there that day to tip things into chaos and were seen changing clothes. They pointed to the involvement of John Sullivan, who has been charged in the riot and is one of the only defendants who has been identified as supporting left-wing causes at times. But there is no evidence that Sullivan is connected to antifa, the FBI or the federal government or that he single-handedly caused the riot.
While there may have been individuals who were trying to quell passions, it's clear from court filings in hundreds of cases that the people who were instigating violence were largely Trump supporters.

No one ""with a concealed carry permit ever committed a mass shooting.""












By Bill McCarthy * June 28, 2022







In the video, Carlson used other people, some of whom are charged in the riot, to bolster his argument. One person claimed that the Capitol police were simply letting everyone in the building in order to intentionally entrap them. But the film didn't acknowledge that law enforcement were vastly outnumbered. One officer died the following day, and four more have died since by suicide.
Carlson's assertions don't hold up to scrutiny
Jesse Norris, a criminal justice professor at the State University of New York at Fredonia who researches entrapment incidents in terrorism prosecutions, told us that in order to show that those charged in Jan. 6 were directly incited or entrapped, Carlson would need to have evidence that undercover police or informants -- who were working at the behest of law enforcement at the time -- were involved in the planning of violence at the Capitol, or the instigation of violence while the protests were underway. 
He would also need to show, Norris added, that the perpetrators were not already predisposed to commit the same crimes without the informants' influence.
""From a common-sense point of view, they were entrapped if the informants got them to do something they wouldn't have realistically done on their own,"" Norris said. 
""The legal definition is narrower,"" he added. ""Under federal law, someone is only entrapped if 1) the informant induced someone to commit a crime, and the inducement is more than just providing an opportunity and also includes some kind of pressure, and 2) the defendant was not already predisposed in some way to commit the same kinds of crimes before meeting the informant.""
Factors used by courts and juries to decide whether a defendant was predisposed include such things as their criminal history, whether they were initially reluctant but were convinced by persistent inducement attempts, whether the idea for the crime originated with the informant, and the types of inducements used to persuade the defendant to commit the crime.
Ira Robbins, a law and justice professor at American University who has studied and written about unindicted co-conspirators, said Carlson's statements don't hold up to scrutiny. 
""Where is the hard evidence going to the elements of entrapment?"" Robbins said. ""Did government agents originate the plan? Were they dealing with innocent individuals who didn't plan or were not involved in criminal activity? Without evidence going directly to these elements, Carlson's assertions are mere hyperbole and rhetoric. What plays well on TV doesn't usually play well in a court of law.""
Meanwhile, even Fox News journalists have issued reports that dispute the conspiracy theory that the FBI helped instigate the riot.
Days before Carlson's film was released, a Fox News' segment about the congressional investigation into the insurrection aired on ""Special Report With Bret Baier."" The segment included an interview with former CIA officer Marc Polymeropoulos, who dismissed the suggestion that Jan. 6 was a false flag.
""One of the things with false flag operations as well, is sometimes it's used by conspiracy theorists to actually hide the truth,"" he said. ""Pretty far-fetched -- in no way was Jan. 6 a false flag operation.""
Our ruling
Carlson claims that federal agents directly incited people on Jan. 6 and ""intentionally entrapped"" American citizens.
There is no evidence that the FBI, or any other government agency, orchestrated or incited the Jan. 6 riot. 
We rate this statement False.

A Facebook post shows boxer Mike Tyson, wearing a t-shirt with the logo ""Plan-Demic. My Body - My Choice."" This includes a crossed-out drawing of a syringe. 
Plan-Demic is the name of a conspiracy theory, perpetuated by an online documentary, which falsely claims Covid-19 is the work of Bill Gates, the World Health Organisation and the pharmaceutical industry. It also claims vaccines weaken the immune system and make people more vulnerable to Covid-19. 
A caption above the photo says ""Mike Tyson knows what's up!""
However, he wasn't wearing that t-shirt in the photo. 
The original photo appears to be taken from a promotional video on Instagram for the brand Smart Cups. In the video, Mr Tyson is wearing a t-shirt with the Smart Cups logo printed on it, not the Plandemic logo.
An exact screen grab from the video, which appears to be the image used in the Facebook post, can be found on this Luxembourg news site in an article about the Instagram video.

On April 1, 2022, (April Fools' Day), the website VerveTimes published an article positing that starting in April 2024, the U.S. government would ban real meat, replacing it with plant-based substitutes:
United States To Ban Real Meat
Evidence that The Great Reset is rapidly approaching can be seen in the recent decision by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to ban real meat, and if history is any indication, the same decision may be taken by other countries as well. The U.S. ban is slated to take effect April 1, 2024.
The decision comes on the heels of repeated public appeals to the Western world by Bill Gates to stop eating real meat and transition to lab-grown synthetic ""beef"" instead.
This item was not a factual recounting of real-life events. The article originated with a website that describes its output as being humorous or satirical in nature, as follows:
This is an April Fool's article and the FDA ban on real meat is a fictional scenario. A primary reason why we post April Fool's articles is to act as warnings. We want to wake people up to see what could happen if actions aren't taken to protect and preserve freedom.
Mention of the ""Great Reset"" in the article's opening sentence is a reference to a conspiracy theory that posits a cabal of secretive global elites were bent on using the COVID-19 pandemic ""to advance their interests and push forward a globalist plot to destroy American sovereignty and prosperity,"" according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which tracks hate and extremism.
As is often the case with conspiracy theories that invoke a ""global elite,"" the conspiracy theory has been used to espouse anti-Semitic ideas, per the ADL.
For background, here is why we sometimes write about satire/humor.

In the first part of Tucker Carlson's controversial and conspiratorial documentary series attempting to rewrite the events of Jan. 6, the Fox News host claimed that the attack on the U.S. Capitol is being used as a front to justify a ""purge"" of Donald Trump voters and a new war on terror.
The series started airing Nov. 1 on Fox Nation, Fox News' subscription streaming service. It was produced as part of a multiyear deal Carlson signed to make specials for Fox Nation, and it was co-written by Scooter Downey, who previously directed films for far-right figures. On Fox News' flagship morning show, ""Fox & Friends,"" Carlson defended the series as ""rock-solid factually.""
Yet the first installment of the three-part documentary, titled ""Patriot Purge,"" advances several conspiracy theories about the insurrection, including that the violence of the day was spurred on by left-wing instigators and agent provacateurs in disguise, and that the siege may have been a trap orchestrated by the FBI. It also includes sympathetic interviews with conservatives involved in the day's events, such as ""Stop the Steal"" organizer Ali Alexander.
The film opens with a video montage juxtaposing footage and commentary related to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the Abu Ghraib prison, Guantanamo Bay and Islamic terrorism with footage and commentary about Jan. 6 and the government's prosecution of the rioters. Elijah Schaffer of BlazeTV, a conservative outlet, is heard describing the Jan. 6 charges as ""political persecution.""
A little more than two minutes in, Carlson took over the screen, saying:
""In the years after 9/11, the media and the national security state used exaggerated threats and outright deception to associate certain ideas with certain events. This was the first war on terror. Now, it's happening again. 
""The very same corrupt interests in Washington that pushed the Iraq War under false pretenses are now pushing the lie of a domestic white terror. They are tying white nationalist terrorism to Trump voters. They're tying Jan. 6 to 9/11. They're tying millions of law abiding Americans to al-Qaida and ISIS. Jan. 6 is being used as a pretext to strip millions of Americans -- disfavored Americans -- of their core constitutional rights, and to defame them as domestic terrorists.""
Carlson provided no evidence to explain how ""millions of Americans"" are getting stripped of their ""core constitutional rights."" Regardless, the claim is far from accurate. And the hundreds of charges brought after Jan. 6 were handed down to people who broke laws as they stormed the Capitol, clashed with police and disrupted congressional proceedings in an effort to overturn the 2020 election results. Most were Trump supporters.

""I'm not aware of anyone being stripped of constitutional rights because of alleged involvement in the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol, let alone 'millions' of people,"" said David Alan Sklansky, professor of law and faculty co-director of the Criminal Justice Center at Stanford Law School.
  Fox News did not offer a comment for this fact-check. 
Nine months after the violent and deadly attack, the Justice Department has arrested about 650 people for involvement, including on charges related to destroying or stealing property, carrying firearms or other weapons, assaulting officers, obstructing official proceedings, and conspiracy. The case details are often spelled out in publicly available arrest warrants turned over to judges.
More than 85% of those people were charged in part using evidence from their own or others' social media accounts, according to George Washington University. Some live streamed their participation in the day's events, while others defended or boasted about it on social media.

The riot also included members of some white supremacist groups, along with members of far-right extremist militia organizations like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers.
But there's no evidence that anywhere close to the 74 million people who voted in 2020 for Trump have been stripped of constitutional rights post-Jan. 6. An estimated 2,000 to 2,500 people entered the Capitol on Jan. 6, according to the Washington Post. One- to two-thirds of them, then, have not been arrested. And among those who have, the arrests haven't extended beyond the people who were involved that day.
Even among those charged, there's no evidence that their constitutional rights are under threat, said Michael Jensen, a senior researcher at the University of Maryland's National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism. ""Nor are there any legal proceedings, legislative debates, or law enforcement actions underway that could result in that outcome.""

A federal judge in October referred a D.C. jail to the Justice Department after finding that it failed to turn over information needed to approve surgery for a defendant's broken wrist. Some Jan. 6 rioters have also spent time in solitary confinement, PolitiFact reported in July. 
But as PolitiFact reported at that time, the vast majority of the Jan. 6 defendants have been released from custody while awaiting trial.
""More than 90% of the individuals who have been charged for participating in the insurrection have been granted release pending trial,"" Jensen said, citing the Justice Department's public database of cases stemming from Jan. 6. 
Of those who have pleaded guilty and been sentenced, only a handful have been set to serve any time in jail, Jensen said, and most will serve only 45 days. ""These are hardly draconian criminal justice outcomes,"" Jensen said.
Nationwide, a significantly lower rate of federal defendants are released pretrial. And an August analysis from the Associated Press countered conservative claims that the pro-Trump rioters on Jan. 6 have experienced harsher treatments than protesters arrested over the summer of 2020. 
People sentenced in international terrorism cases often face 15-year prison terms and years of restrictions after prison, by contrast, Jensen said.
""It's ridiculous to compare the post-Jan. 6 investigation and prosecutions to what happened after 9/11. People were held without charges post-9/11. People were tortured,"" added Sklansky, the Stanford Law School professor. ""There is nothing remotely equivalent to that happening.""
In ""Patriot Purge: Part 2,"" released Nov. 2, Carlson furthered the same theme, telling viewers there is ""a new war on terror"" focused on ""hunting down American citizens, purging them from society, and throwing some of them into solitary confinement."" He claimed that the government's response to Jan. 6 is really ""a purge aimed at the legacy Americans"" and ""inconvenient citizens who vote the wrong way."" And he warned, ""It took a decade for the federal government to find Osama bin Laden. They can find you a lot faster. They likely already have.""
Our ruling
In his film, Carlson said, ""Jan. 6 is being used as a pretext to strip millions of Americans -- disfavored Americans -- of their core constitutional rights."" 
There is no evidence that the hundreds of people arrested for participating in the assault on the Capitol have been stripped of their constitutional rights, let alone that millions of Trump supporters are also under threat of losing their rights.
There is also nothing pretextual about the prosecutions, which have targeted only those who breached the Capitol, assaulted police or committed other crimes during what was an historic attempt to overturn an election. Many rioters posted about their involvement on social media.

(Last updated July 24, 2019.)
U.S. law enforcement agencies and Congress are investigating links between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia, as part of a broader probe into Moscow's interference in the 2016 election.
To date, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation has resulted in five former Trump aides agreeing to work with Mueller's team under plea deals. Numerous Trump associates had contacts with Russian government officials or business people during the campaign and presidential transition.

July 8, 2017: The New York Times reported on the June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower where Trump, Jr., Manafort and Kushner met with a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer. That story prompted Trump Jr. to issue the following statement to the media:
""It was a short introductory meeting. I asked Jared (Kushner) and Paul (Manafort) to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up.
""I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand.""
July 9, 2017: The New York Times reported that Trump Jr. arranged the June 9, 2016, Trump Tower meeting after being promised he would receive damaging information about Clinton. For the second consecutive day, Trump Jr. issued a statement to the media about the meeting. (Read a full account of the Trump team's shifting explanations.)
July 14, 2017: One of the attendees of the Trump Tower meeting, Russian-American Rinat Akhmetshin, a former Soviet soldier with experience in military counterintelligence, said that after the meeting, Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya left behind documents for the Trump campaign. According to an interview with the Associated Press, Akhmetshin said Veselnitskaya believed the documents detailed ""the flow of illicit funds to the Democrats,"" and she suggested to the campaign that publishing them could help Trump's electoral chances.
Aug. 1, 2017: White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked about a news report that the president had tried to change the narrative around Trump Jr.'s meeting with the Russian lawyer. Sanders said Trump ""weighed in"" on his son's statement about the June 9 Trump Tower meeting. Sanders' statement is inconsistent with previous explanations offered by Trump's team.
Aug. 2, 2017: Trump signed a law imposing new Russia sanctions in response to Moscow's interference with the election.

April 9, 2018: The FBI raided the offices of Trump's longtime lawyer and aide Michael Cohen. The case was referred to the U.S. Attorney's office in the Southern District of New York.

The committee's top Democrat, Adam Schiff of California, criticized GOP members for closing the investigation prematurely, and called their findings superficial and politically motivated. Statements made by Cohen about Trump Tower Moscow, which Cohen later admitted were lies, go largely unchallenged in the report.

The indictment made reference to an unnamed U.S. person who ""was in regular contact with senior members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump,"" and who communicated during the election with Guccifer 2.0, a front for Russian operatives. Former Trump campaign adviser Stone acknowledged he is ""probably"" the U.S. person referenced in the indictment.
July 16, 2018: In a joint press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump appeared to accept Putin's denial of Russian election interference. (The following day Trump claimed he misspoke.)

July 27, 2018: Trump denied a CNN report that he knew in advance about the June 9, 2016, Trump Tower meeting. The report was based on unnamed sources who said former Trump attorney Cohen is willing to confirm Trump's foreknowledge of the meeting to the special counsel. In repsonse, Trump tweeted, ""I did NOT know of the meeting with my son, Don jr. Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?),"" an apparent reference to Cohen's role managing taxi companies.
Aug. 1, 2018: Trump called on his attorney general to end the Mueller probe, tweeting: ""This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further.""
Aug. 5, 2018: Trump tweeted about the June, 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower, saying it was ""a meeting to get information on an opponent,"" adding to the series of shifting explanations of the meeting arranged by Donald Trump Jr.
Fake News reporting, a complete fabrication, that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son, Donald, had in Trump Tower. This was a meeting to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics - and it went nowhere. I did not know about it!-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 5, 2018 

Aug. 21, 2018: Manafort was convicted of eight of 18 felony counts. A jury found Manafort guilty on five tax fraud charges, one charge of hiding foreign bank accounts and two counts bank fraud. A mistrial was declared for the other 10 charges.

Nov. 20, 2018: Trump submitted written answers to Mueller's questions.
Nov. 26, 2018: Papadopoulos reported to prison to serve a two-week sentence.
Nov. 26, 2018: Mueller's team accused Manafort of breaching his plea agreement, saying he repeatedly lied to federal investigators. The special counsel's office argued in a court filing that ""crimes and lies"" Manafort committed after the plea deal relieve Mueller's team from honoring their end of the bargain. Manafort denied the charges.
Nov. 26, 2018: Pundit and conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi rejected a plea offer from the special counsel. A draft of the plea deal alleges Corsi gave Stone advance notice in August 2016 that WikiLeaks would release damage information on Hillary Clinton. A subsequent indictment of Stone reiterated many of the same allegations.
Nov. 27, 2018: Manafort denied ever meeting with Julian Assange, following a report in The Guardian claiming Trump's onetime campaign manager held secret talks with the WikiLeaks editor at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.
""I have never met Julian Assange or anyone connected to him,"" Manafort said in a statement. ""I have never been contacted by anyone connected to Wikileaks, either directly or indirectly. I have never reached out to Assange or Wikileaks on any matter.""
Nov. 29, 2018: Cohen pled guilty to to lying to Congress about the Russian-based development proposal Trump Tower Moscow. Cohen admitted he lied when he told lawmakers he had only briefed Trump on the project three times, and that negotiations broke down in January 2016. In fact, talks continued as late as June 2016, after Trump became the Republican Party's presumptive nominee.
Cohen also concealed his communications with Kremlin officials, as well as the fact he asked Trump to travel to Moscow to further the deal. He said his lies were intended to harmonize with the Trump campaign's ""political messaging.""
Nov. 29, 2018: Cohen's Russian business associate, Felix Sater, said he and Cohen were interested in offering a $50 million penthouse in Trump Tower Moscow to Putin because they believed ""it would entice other wealthy buyers to purchase their own.""
Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said Sater's comment, if true, shows House investigations should continue to probe ""what, if any, financial leverage the Russians may hold over President Trump and the Trump Organization.""
Schiff, who is expected to lead the committee when the Democrats take control of the House in January 2019, said the panel intends to call Cohen back to testify again, as do Senate Democrats. The House committee's Democratic members also plan to send the special counsel all unredacted transcripts of interviews the panel conducted as part of its Russia investigation.
Nov. 30, 2018: Trump responded via Twitter to defend his pursuit of Trump Tower Moscow, describing his business as ""very legal and very cool.""
""Oh, I get it! I am a very good developer, happily living my life, when I see our Country going in the wrong direction (to put it mildly). Against all odds, I decide to run for President & continue to run my business-very legal & very cool, talked about it on the campaign trail ... Lightly looked at doing a building somewhere in Russia. Put up zero money, zero guarantees and didn't do the project. Witch Hunt!""
Nov. 30, 2018: The special counsel's office said it may retry Manafort on previous charges that led to hung jury.
Nov. 30, 2018: Lawyers for Cohen requested that he be spared prison, citing Cohen's cooperation with federal investigations, including the special counsel probe.
Dec. 7, 2018: The special counsel's office accused Manafort of lying multiple times to investigators, in breach of his federal plea deal.
Dec. 12, 2018: Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for financial crimes as well as for lying to Congress. He was also ordered to pay $2 million in penalties.
Before the sentence was handed down, Cohen told the courtroom, ""It was my own weakness and a blind loyalty to this man (Trump) that led me to choose a path of darkness over light. Time and time again I felt it was my duty to cover up his dirty deeds.""
Dec. 13, 2018: Maria Butina, a Russian living in the United States, pled guilty to conspiring to act as an illegal foreign agent. Butina has been accused of trying to infiltrate Republican power circles.
Jan. 8, 2019: Manafort's lawyers submitted a court filing denying that Manafort breached his plea deal, as the special counsel's office alleged. The filing inadvertently revealed that Manafort shared 2016 election polling data with his business partner Kilimnik, whom Mueller had previously charged with of obstruction of justice.
Jan. 18, 2019: The special counsel denied a BuzzFeed News report which claimed that Trump directed Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow project. In a rare public comment, a spokesman for Mueller said, ""BuzzFeed's description of specific statements to the special counsel's office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen's congressional testimony are not accurate.""
Jan. 23, 2019: Cohen, in a statement from his lawyer, announced he would not voluntarily testify before the House Oversight Committee in coming weeks, as he had planned. Cohen cited ""ongoing threats against his family from President Trump and Mr. (Rudolph) Giuliani"" as among the reasons for the reversal. The following day, the Senate Intelligence Committee subpoenaed him; he is slated to testify Feb. 12.
Jan. 24, 2019: The FBI arrested Trump's longtime friend and associate Stone. He was charged with seven felonies, including lying to Congress under oath, witness tampering and obstruction. The indictment lays out a pattern of behavior that gives the strong impression Stone tried to conceal his contacts with WikiLeaks.
Jan. 27, 2019: The Trump administration lifted sanctions on three companies connected to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, over objections from Democratic lawmakers, who were joined by some Republicans. Experts said sanctions relief wasn't a demonstration of Trump's coziness with Russian oligarchs, so much as it was his administration's way of ending the disruption it inflicted on the global metals market when it sanctioned Deripaska's aluminum company Rusal. (Read our full report.)
March 22, 2019: Mueller concluded his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and related matters. Mueller submitted a confidential report to Attorney General William Barr explaining his ""prosecution and declination decisions."" Barr told lawmakers who lead congressional judiciary committees in a letter that he would advise them the special counsel's principal conclusions, perhaps as soon as this weekend.
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the White House had not received or been briefed on the report. She added that Barr would determine the next steps, adding, ""We look forward to the process taking its course.""
April 18, 2019: Barr released a redacted version of the special counsel's report spanning about 400 pages. It reaffirmed that Russia favored Trump over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, and that the Trump campaign believed it would benefit from Russia's interference. However, the investigation did not establish coordination or a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.
The report also outlined ""key issues and events"" examined as part of the investigation on whether Trump obstructed justice. Mueller did not make a determination on that matter. ""The evidence we obtained about the president's actions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred,"" Mueller said. ""Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.""
(Read more about our key takeaways from the report.)
May 29, 2019: Mueller brought the investigation to a formal close in his first public statement about the Russia probe. Mueller recapped Russia's attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and explained why he could not have brought charges against the president even if he found they were substantiated.
Under long-standing department policy, Mueller said, a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while in office. ""That is unconstitutional,"" Mueller said, adding that even if the charge is kept under seal and hidden from the public, ""that, too, is prohibited.""
Mueller's last words emphasized the overarching findings of the nearly two-year probe.
""I will close by reiterating the essential allegation of our indictments, that there were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election,"" Mueller said. ""That allegation deserves the attention of every American.""
July 24, 2019: Mueller testified before two House committees, limiting himself to findings published in the special counsel's report. He concluded his opening statement by saying, ""Over the course of my career, I've seen a number of challenges to our democracy. The Russian government's effort to interfere in our election is among the most serious. As I said on May 29, this deserves the attention of every American.""

80.Whendosenatorsresign,"
Newsmax TV host Grant Stinchfield suggested that Vice President-elect Sen. Kamala Harris is holding onto her Senate seat because of the inaccurate claim that President Donald Trump can still win reelection.
""Harris is a woman who has yet to resign from the United States Senate in preparation of becoming the next vice president and ultimately president, if the media gets their way,"" he said Dec. 15. ""Why hasn't she resigned yet? Because maybe, like all of us, she still thinks President Trump has a shot at victory, if only all the evidence of fraud can be proven and exposed.""
There's no evidence to back Stinchfield's speculation. President-elect Joe Biden won the election, and electors across the country sealed his victory on Dec. 14 after weeks of litigation from Trump and his allies revealed no evidence of widespread fraud to change the results.
Harris' decision to remain in the Senate for some time before becoming vice president is not unusual. She isn't required to resign yet.
""No rule bars the vice president-elect from her day job representing California until she takes the oath on the 20th,"" said Terry Sullivan, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. ""Then the constitutional ban on serving in two branches kicks in.""
Anthony Rizzo, a spokesperson for Newsmax, said Stinchfield ""was only speculating"" as to why Harris had not left her seat. ""He offered no conspiracy theory or claim she was not resigning for this reason,"" Rizzo said, adding that Newsmax recently declared Biden the president-elect.
The Biden transition team pointed to Harris' public comments and tweets referencing Biden's victory over Trump.
Some commentators who have made similar suggestions about Harris' continued work in the Senate, including fellow Newsmax host Greg Kelly, noted that former President Barack Obama resigned from his own Senate seat in mid-November before moving to the White House.
Obama's resignation was historically early compared with other officials in his shoes. According to the New York Times, he resigned earlier than any other president-elect or vice president-elect over the last 50 years who held public office at the time of his or her election.
""Al Gore resigned from the Senate on Jan. 2, 1993, and Joe Biden resigned from the Senate on Jan. 15, 2009,"" said Jack Beermann, a professor of law at Boston University.
There are several reasons why Harris may want to stay in her seat. It's possible she is waiting for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, also a Democrat, to appoint her successor. Holding her seat also allows her to vote on Senate matters or participate in committee hearings.

""It would only be prudent for Harris to keep her Senate seat until she becomes a member of the executive branch at noon Jan. 20, 2021,"" said James Pfiffner, a professor emeritus in the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. ""The Senate might conceivably consider important issues between now and then.""
""If her vote were important, she could resign the morning of the inauguration,"" Beermann added.
Harris may also want to be present if Republican senators object in January to the counting of Electoral College votes in a longshot attempt to overturn the results of the election, experts said.
One reason a senator in Harris' position might resign early is ""so a successor will be ahead in seniority, which can eventually impact committee assignments,"" said Aaron Crawford, assistant editor of the Papers of Andrew Jackson at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. 
Previous presidents and vice presidents have followed no clear pattern, the New York Times review shows. Vice President Mike Pence, for example, served as Indiana's governor until Jan. 9, 2017, according to Indiana's official state website.
Two other vice presidents who came into office after working in the Senate -- Dan Quayle, who served with President George H.W. Bush, and Walter Mondale, who served with President Jimmy Carter -- left their Senate seats in January and December, respectively.
One odd case occurred in 1961: Lyndon B. Johnson, a senator representing Texas, had run simultaneously for reelection to the Senate and for vice president on a ticket with President John F. Kennedy. He won both races. ""He was actually sworn in (to the Senate) for the new term on Jan. 3 and then immediately resigned,"" Crawford said.

33.PolitiFactMailbagYou,"
In December, PolitiFact awarded the annual Lie of the Year to lies about the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, lawmakers argued over the price tag of Build Back Better legislation, and Americans grappled with inflation and gas prices. 
Our fact-checking of these topics prompted many of our readers to send us emails and comment on social media including on our Facebook page. Here is a look at some of our readers' responses, lightly edited for length and clarity. Readers can email us fact-check ideas and feedback at [email protected].
PolitiFact had many options to choose from for our Lie of the Year: claims that the 2020 electio was stolen, claims that the COVID vaccine didn't work, and the one we chose, lies about the Capitol insurrection and its significance. We chose this lie due its historical significance and because the events of Jan. 6 were widely broadcast on that day and many days afterward, allowing the public to see for itself exactly what happened. (Readers chose former President Donald Trump's claim that he won the 2020 election.) We heard a mixture of reactions from readers:
One commenter on our video expressed disappointment. ""I wanted one lie not lies. I agree that the nonsense about Jan. 6 not being an insurrection is a big deal and worrisome, but the vote was for 2021 LIE of the Year, not LIES of the year. If that were the case, I would have voted for all of them. Because they are all a danger to truth."" (This was not the first year that our Lie of the Year was a compilation of multiple lies.)

On reddit, one reader asked a frequent question we hear at PolitiFact: ""Why not call political 'falsehoods' what they really are: lies?"" PolitiFact's use of the phrase Pants on Fire ""does a disservice and downplays the severity of the disinformation and outright lies spread by partisan media as well as politicians."" 
We only use the word ""lie"" once a year. That's because of the tricky issue of claiming to know a person's intention. (PolitiFact Editor-in-Chief Angie Drobnic Holan explained in more detail our position on the word ""lie"" in a 2018 essay.)
One reader said we showed political bias and objected to this sentence in our story: ""There is no evidence that the hundreds of people arrested for participating in the assault on the Capitol have been stripped of their constitutional rights, let alone that millions of Trump supporters are also under threat of losing their rights."" The reader pointed to a statement by U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth who said in court that a defendant's civil rights were violated by the D.C. Department of Corrections. The reader wrote that ""although Lamberth's statement refers to a single individual, he asked the Justice Department to investigate whether the civil rights of inmates were being violated.""
The reader is correct that Lamberth raised concerns about treatment of an inmate, but that was about an inmate who he said didn't get timely medical care -- not that his civil rights were violated for being arrested and charged with a crime.
A Florida reader said in an email that our choice for Lie of the Year was ""spot on."" The reader added: ""I know it takes time and a heck of a lot of effort to sift through the thousands of lies sent out daily. Thanks for publishing the truth.""
One reader said we overlooked an important detail about rhetoric surrounding Jan. 6.
""It continues to gall me as a veteran and an American to hear the right use and own the word 'patriot' as they lie and attempt to rig elections. A perfect example is Tucker Carlson's phrase 'patriot purge' for referring to the subversive criminals who attempted to overthrow the legitimate election of 2020.""
RELATED: Tucker Carlson's 'Patriot Purge' film on Jan. 6 is full of falsehoods, conspiracy theories
Another reader said the lies about Jan. 6 ""should be the 'Lie of the Century.' A shameful day in our history that sadly, many are still trying to minimize and dilute how awful and just plain wrong (CRIMINAL) that it was.""
One reader praised our article but said we picked the wrong Lie of the Year.
""By far the biggest, and most damaging, Lie of Year has been Trump's constant rhetoric that the election was stolen. The Capitol riot was a byproduct of his election lies. His election lies caused the riot. Trump's attempt to actually try and overturn a valid election is beyond concerning. I'm shocked people can't see it for what it is. ... I can't think of a more un-American crime than to subvert democracy.""    
One reader wrote: ""Thank you once again for your commitment to truth. How can we ever turn the tide of lies and half truths Tucker and others continue to deal us?""
CBS in Boston highlighted our Lie of the Year story and interviewed U.S. Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass, about denial of what happened that day.
""The way (Republicans) want to dismiss this, the way they say it doesn't matter -- it does!"" said McGovern, who was inside the House chamber during the riot. ""I think their denial, their complicity makes it all the more likely that we will see another such attack. Coups often don't succeed the first time, but sometimes they succeed the second or third time. I want to make sure this never happens again.""
***
Biden said in December, ""even after accounting for rising prices, the typical American family has more money in their pockets than they did last year.""  The standard metric used for this purpose -- per capita, inflation-adjusted personal disposable income -- has risen steadily since before the pandemic hit, even when some anomalous quarters during the pandemic are factored out. We rated this statement Mostly True. We fact-checked the overall picture, but some readers said their personal situation didn't result in more money in their pockets. 
""Not sure whose pockets they looked at,"" wrote one reader on twitter. ""I'm spending more on housing than I did 2 yrs ago.""
""Disposable income (ie cash) for many households went up during the pandemic because people were not going out to do anything due to lockdowns,"" another reader tweeted. 
***
Trump said in an interview in December that gasoline prices were $1.86 a gallon when he left office. The national average price for gasoline when Trump left the White House was actually $2.38, or about 28% higher than what Trump said. We rated the statement False. We focused on national average prices, while also highlighting prices from California and Texas. Readers noted that they found variation based on where they were buying gas.
During Trump's tenure as president, ""I drove and bought gasoline in a dozen states around the country. I found $4 fuel and I found $2 fuel every year,"" one reader wrote on Facebook. ""Price fluctuations are more the result of refinery catastrophes, hurricanes, lengthy blizzards, high/low demands, proximity to major amusement parks, first/last gas station near a long stretch of remote highway, That's true of every president's term.""
***
Critical race theory -- a broad set of ideas about systemic bias and privilege -- became an explosive flashpoint in campaigns and in America's state legislatures in 2021. We explained the theory and states' responses in a story, and fact-checked falsehoods about curriculum in Virginia and Arizona as well as a claim about action by the Justice Department.
One reader sent us an email thanking us for covering the topic and ""false accusations leveled at it."" The reader said he read the book ""Critical Race Theory"" by Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic and ""found nothing in it that would make me 'ashamed of being white,' as some of the opponents of CRT claim that CRT does,"" the reader wrote. ""Keep up the great work!""

170.OregonManHangsEffigy,"
On 12 September 2016, local media in Oregon reported that a man from the small city of Sutherlin, north of Medford, had hung an image of Hillary Clinton in effigy alongside the heavily-trafficked Interstate 5.
Billy Pitner strung the wetsuit, hot pink brassiere and blonde wig up from a crane along the freeway along with the words, ""Vote Trump,"" ""Uranium One"" and ""Treason? Ask her."" When asked about the display by local news station KVAL, Pitner said:
I'm allowed to have my feelings, right, wrong, or indifferent. Here you are. Got your attention, didn't it?
The phrase ""Uranium One"" refers to a deal that granted Russia one-fifth of all uranium production capacity in the United States -- a deal that Hillary Clinton, when serving as U.S. Secretary of State, signed off on (along with other American governmental agencies). 
According to a 23 April 2015 investigative piece by the New York Times, little is known about the deal, making it a fertile breeding ground for conspiracy theories:
As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium One's chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors. Other people with ties to the company made donations as well.
And shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Mr. Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.
The idea that Clinton has committed a crime is a common theme among Trump supporters, who at the Republican National Convention in July 2016 could be heard chanting, ""Lock her up.""

10.PrinceWilliamisnotleadingaglobaldepopulationagenda,"
A viral Facebook post claims that the Duke of Cambridge said there are ""too many people on earth"" and is part of a powerful group pushing a ""global depopulation"" agenda. 
While Prince William has made comments in the past about the pressure of growing populations on wildlife, he didn't say this exactly and claims that he is part of ""the committee of 300"" building a ""new world order"" evoke baseless long-running conspiracy theories. 
Did the duke say there are ""too many people in the world""?
Not directly. The post claims that on 3 November 2017, the duke said there are ""too many people in the world"", presented as a quote. 
It appears that Prince William did not actually say this, though he did say: ""Africa's rapidly growing human population is predicted to more than double by 2050 - a staggering increase of three and a half million people per month. 
""There is no question that this increase puts wildlife and habitat under enormous pressure.""
The comments were made on 2 November 2017, during a speech at a gala dinner for the wildlife conservation charity Tusk Trust, of which he is royal patron. They were reported that night by the Telegraph with the headline ""Prince William warns that there are too many people in the world"". 
This was widely picked up the following day, with the MailOnline starting its headline with ""Duke of Cambridge insists there are too many people in the world"" and the Express writing ""Prince William says there are too many people on Earth"". It appears that these headlines have been interpreted as a direct quote by the creator of the post on Facebook. 
What is Agenda 21? 
The post refers to what it describes as the ""UN Agenda 21 global depopulation plan for mankind"". The United Nations' Agenda 21 was published in 1992, and is a 351-page document setting out sustainable development objectives. 
The document does outline the stress a growing population places on earth's resources, but Full Fact could find no reference to reducing the world's population. 
This isn't the first time we've seen the UN's sustainable development reports appear alongside conspiracy theories. In March we fact checked similar claims, this time on Whatsapp, in which it was claimed that Covid-19 was being used to usher in Agenda 2030 and begin the ""enslavement of humanity"". 
Again, Agenda 30 is a sustainable development plan agreed to by member states of the United Nations in 2015, which includes 17 global objectives covering things like reducing inequality and ending world hunger.
Prince William does not ""preside over"" the UN, as the post suggests, in any official capacity. In October 2020 it was announced that the duke had launched an award designed to tackle environmental challenges, in collaboration with the UN, but this doesn't mean he has a leadership role within the organisation. 
The rest of the post contains a number of phrases that commonly refer to, or mirror, conspiracy theories, including the ""new world order"" and the ""committee of 300"".
The term ""new world order"" describes an anti-government conspiracy theory that became popular in the 1990s and has persisted to the present day. Those who subscribe to the theory believe that a secretive totalitarian government already controls most of the planet and is moving towards the enslavement of humanity. 
The ""committee of 300"", sometimes referred to as the ""Olympians""  is another decades-old conspiracy theory, which claims that  a ""secret upper-level parallel government... runs Britain and the US"".

48.DidDavidHoggAttendaC,"
In the weeks after a gunman opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida on 14 February 2018, killing seventeen people, Internet trolls and ""hoaxers"" continued to share an already completely debunked rumor that David Hogg -- a teenaged survivor of the mass shooting who has since become an outspoken advocate of gun control -- is actually a professional actor who went to school in southern California:

As Hogg's classmates have pointed out and as we reported previously, the above meme is a very low-quality, low-effort Internet hoax -- the photograph actually confirms that Hogg is legitimately an Marjory Stone Douglas High School student because the image was taken from MSD's yearbook, a fact that could be gleaned from another student in the very same image wearing an MSD ""Eagles"" mascot shirt two rows above him:

There's a photo going around claiming David Hogg did not attend Douglas, but a school in California. Here's a video to debunk that: pic.twitter.com/hJsMNSdAsF
-- Joey (@_Joey_Wong) February 21, 2018

Hogg had visited California in 2017 and witnessed an altercation, about which he made a video blog -- a simple fact that was blown out by conspiracy theorists to mean he already lived in Los Angeles and was part of the entertainment industry. (Hogg did live in California, but relocated with his family to Florida before starting high school; he returns to visit every year, as many people do.) 
Nikolas Cruz, 19, a former Marjory Stone Douglas student who used an AR-15 semi-automatic firearm he had reportedly purchased from a gun store to carry out the mass shooting, has since been charged with murder; Parkland students have galvanized a national movement calling for stricter gun legislation. Hogg has been one of the most vocal leaders in what has become known as the ""March For Our Lives.""
The students' activism has made them the target of ""hoaxers"" -- deranged Internet users and grifters who spread false information that mass shooting incidents are manufactured by the government to seize guns and hand power to a secret global cabal working to install an authoritarian world government.
Such hoaxers have periodically been arrested and jailed for physically stalking and harassing survivors, but despite their outlandish beliefs and apparent moral debasement, they are not exactly the ""fringe."" Far-right web sites and Internet personalities like GatewayPundit.com writer Lucian Wintrich, undeterred by ongoing lawsuits related to previous conspiracy theory-related blunders, have claimed the Parkland students were reading from scripts, while the National Rifle Association said in an official statement in response to a nationwide march on 24 March 2018 that the events were staged by ""Hollywood elites.""

6.ImageshowsPaulPelosibruisedinabookingmugshot,"
A viral image purports to show House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband looking badly bruised in a mugshot snapped following his May arrest on suspicion of driving under the influence.
Napa County authorities released and shared with PolitiFact an authentic mugshot of businessman Paul Pelosi, 82, on June 13. But the image ricocheting around the internet for several days before that -- in which Pelosi appears disheveled and with a black eye -- is not real. 
"" It's a complete fake,"" said Larry Kamer, a spokesperson for Paul Pelosi.
The fake mugshot appears to have been created using digital editing. Snopes reported that an image of Pelosi from Getty Images was altered to add bruising around his eye, a prison uniform and other distortions to create what looks like a genuine booking photo. 
According to Snopes, the original, unaltered photograph shows Paul Pelosi in a suit beside Nancy Pelosi. It was taken in 2016 at a gala before the Grammy Awards, according to a Getty Images caption.
The first iteration of the fake mugshot PolitiFact could find cropped up June 8 on patriots.win, a far-right message board. A screenshot of that post spread quickly to Truth Social, former President Donald Trump's social media app, and the messaging app Telegram, where it was shared among some promoters of the QAnon conspiracy theory. Soon, screenshots of those posts were on Twitter and Facebook.

This PolitiFact illustration shows how a fake Paul Pelosi mugshot spread from the patriots.win message board to Truth Social and Facebook.
The Facebook posts were flagged as part of the platform's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Paul Pelosi was arrested close to midnight on May 28 after a two-vehicle collision, according to the California Highway Patrol's collision report, a copy of which was obtained by PolitiFact. The report says Pelosi was driving a 2021 Porsche into an intersection when his car was hit by a 2014 Jeep. The 48-year-old Jeep driver was not arrested and no injuries were reported. 
Pelosi was arrested in connection with driving under the influence and driving with a blood alcohol content of 0.08% or higher, according to the Napa County Department of Corrections. His court date has been set for Aug. 3, at which time he would be arraigned if charges are filed, per the Napa County District Attorney's Office. He was released the morning after his arrest. 
Other viral misinformation relating to Pelosi's arrest claimed that all charges had been dropped. PolitiFact rated this claim False.

176.FloridaGovernorsWife,"
In August 2016, multiple reports emerged that Ann Scott, the wife of Florida governor Rick Scott, either owned a mosquito spraying company outright, or owned a major stake in one.  The rumor has added fuel to emerging conspiracy theories that Zika is either a hoax, or that it was purposely introduced into the United States to distract from national politics.
However, the Zika virus is not only real, but it is making inroads into the United States (and beyond) as travelers bearing the disease arrive within its borders, despite safety warnings.  Zika is just one of the millions of viruses and bacteria that mutate and can quickly spread, potentially bringing a pandemic to the world on the level of the bubonic plague, or, more recently, the 1918 influenza outbreak.  
Diseases can appear or mutate seemingly out of nowhere, and technological advances can bring about unforeseen consequences, as researcher and writer Laurie Garrett detailed in her 1994 book, The Coming Plague. In one chapter, Garrett writes about an outbreak of a mysterious disease that sickened more than 200 attendees of the 1976 American Legion convention at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, eventually killing 25 people. It was dubbed the ""Philly Killer"" at first, then Legionnaire's Disease -- and traced back to bacteria breeding in the hotel's air conditioning system: 
Armed with such observations, medical historian Robert Hudson of the University of Kansas closed the international gathering on a particularly frightening note. After describing the Black Death plague of medieval Europe, Hudson warned that ""when we grant our existing knowledge of microscopic pathogens is deficient, we necessarily grant the possibility at least of the returns of a return of the great epidemics of the past.... the possibility exists that a deadly and common organism could emerge that is easily spread from person to person and that might be aloof to all available therapeutic and preventive methods.""
""The Philadelphia event remains unsettling because it shows the very real limitations of our tools for investigating an apparently new microbial disease,"" Hudson concluded.  ""If we are to retain public confidence in the face of some future serious epidemic, it is important that our limitations remain widely understood. As a medical community, there is no cause to be humiliated by the Legionnaire's affair, but it is altogether proper that we be humbled.""
Chagrined by the events of 1976, the U.S. public health community looked to the future, for the first time in the late twentieth century, with a vague sense of unease.
That unease has persisted as the world has become far more interconnected and travel has become much more commonplace within a single generation.  In the case of Zika, the virus is spread by mosquitos.  Although it was first detected in 1947, the disease didn't become a global issue until 2015.  According to Dr. Amy Vittor of the University of Florida, the modern world has created a fertile breeding ground for Zika (and other mosquito-borne pathogens) to thrive:
We found that deforestation followed by agriculture and regrowth of low-lying vegetation provided a much more suitable environment for the malaria mosquito carrier than pristine forest.
Increasing urbanization and poverty create a fertile environment for the mosquitoes that spread dengue by creating ample breeding sites. In addition, climate change may raise the temperature and/or humidity in areas that previously have been below the threshold required for the mosquitoes to thrive.
The second layer is the introduction of the mosquito vector. Aedes aegyptiand Aedes albopictus have expanded their geographic range in the past few decades. Urbanization, changing climate, air travel and transportation, and waxing and waning control efforts that are at the mercy of economic and political factors have led to these mosquitoes spreading to new areas and coming back in areas where they had previously been eradicated. 






In other words, if it's not Zika, there will be something else waiting in the wings, and to work in public health is to constantly be aware of potential pandemics. As cynical as it may sound, the upswing in insect-borne illnesses like Zika means there's money in mosquito eradication -- a lot of it.  The financial industry, always looking for the next place to invest, naturally landed on pest control, an industry that has shown ""substantial growth"" since 2014:
The pest control market has shown a substantial growth in the recent year. The need for hygienic and pest free environment has boosted the need and demand for pest control services. NOVONOUS estimates that Global Pest Control Services market will grow at a CAGR [compound annual growth rate] of 5.52% by 2020.
That means that investment companies will show pest control services in their portfolios.  According to a 17 August 2016 article in FloridaBulldog.org, an independent nonprofit news organization that covers the state, Ann Scott has a large financial stake in a pest control company out of Louisiana (""Mosquito Control Services LLC"") through a private investment firm that she co-owns:
Ann Scott's large stake in MCS is via G. Scott Capital Partners, an investment firm that boasts $291 million of client assets. The firm manages several private equity funds and various ""family accounts primarily comprised of trusts and family entities,"" according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission records.
The Florida Bulldog reported in 2014 that Scott Capital, as it is known online, is operated by a trio of men who once worked at Richard L. Scott Investments, the private equity firm where Gov. Scott made millions for himself and his family putting together big-money investment deals when he was in the private sector.
Scott Capital posts its portfolio online. All nine listed companies are current and former investments of the governor and/or Mrs. Scott, including Mosquito Control Services, described as providing ""mosquito abatement services primarily to municipalities.""
The rumors bear a striking similarity to a story about the Scotts owning (or having a financial interest in) a drug-testing company, which came to light at the same time that the state decided to test the urine of welfare recipients and state workers, at their own expense:
All these changes could benefit that $62 million investment, but Scott sees no legal conflict between his public role and private investments.
And, experts say, under Florida law he is correct.
A few days before he took office in January, Scott moved his shares in Solantic Corp., a chain of 32 urgent care centers, to the Frances Annette Scott Revocable Trust. Scott co-founded Solantic in 2001 and was involved in its operation until last year. His wife's trust now holds enough stock in the private company to control it.
While the ethical considerations of the Scotts owning any financial stake in either Solantic or MCS (and the strong, but mysteriously obscure links they have to the investment firm) is a topic that would perhaps benefit from much more discussion and transparency, it is inaccurate to say that Ann Scott outright owns a Zika mosquito spraying company, as some headlines would have you believe  -- or that Zika is either a hoax or a conspiracy.  
Its appearance in the United States' national consciousness, much like Ebola's in 2014, can be attributed to a strong and media-savvy public health sector trying to raise awareness and alarms before a problematic but still relatively rare disease (which has been linked to everything from microcephaly and other congenital brain abnormalities to Guillain-Barre syndrome) becomes an outright, explosive pandemic.

7.DonaldTrumpauthorizedupto20000NationalGuardtroopstoprotecttheCapitolbeforeJan62021butwasrejectedbyNancyPelosiandChuckSchumer,"
Twenty million Americans tuned in June 9 as the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol described how then-President Donald Trump fueled the mob with bogus claims of a stolen election.
The audience watching Fox News got a different story from its hosts: a litany of conspiracy theories from Tucker Carlson and a defense of Trump by Sean Hannity.
Hannity repeatedly claimed that Trump authorized 20,000 National Guard troops for the Capitol before the riot, and that the former president's efforts to secure the building were thwarted by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.
""If Donald Trump authorized up to 20,000 National Guard troops to protect the Capitol, how does it make sense that they are there on national television blaming Donald Trump for wanting to start an insurrection?"" Hannity said on his June 9 show. He repeated the claim several times in the hour, often blaming Pelosi and Schumer, and again the following night. 

Trump similarly claimed on June 9 that he ""offered up to 20,000 National Guard"" prior to the event and that ""crazy Nancy Pelosi turned down the offer.""
There was no evidence to support such a claim in February 2021, when Trump said on Fox News that he had requested 10,000 National Guard troops but was rebuffed by Pelosi.
There's still no record of any such authorization being made, or of Pelosi standing in the way. The D.C. National Guard reports ""solely to the president of the United States,"" per its website.
""This is not true,"" Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, told PolitiFact June 10. ""The Speaker of the House doesn't have the power to do this. No request was made for the National Guard before Jan. 6.""
""No congressional official, or body, has the authority to activate the National Guard to the U.S. Capitol. Only the president,"" added Jane. L Campbell, president and CEO of the U.S. Capitol Historical Society. ""If the president calls the National Guard to the U.S. Capitol, no congressional official has the authority to decline its service.""
In fact, about 20 minutes before Hannity went on air, the House committee noted that then-Vice President Mike Pence had called for the National Guard on Jan. 6 -- not Trump.
Fox News did not respond to a request for comment.
No basis for 10,000, 20,000 number
As PolitiFact previously reported, what Trump described in February 2021 as a formal request for 10,000 troops was actually an offhand remark to then-acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller. Miller said he took it as hyperbole based on Trump's expectation for a massive crowd. There's no evidence the remark was handled as an official authorization.
A Vanity Fair reporter who followed Miller during the last week of Trump's administration detailed the remark in a report. The report said that on Jan. 5, 2021, Miller and his chief of staff Kash Patel were meeting with Trump about an issue related to Iran. (A Defense Department inspector general's report appeared to place the meeting on Jan. 3.)
The Vanity Fair report said the conversation suddenly ""switched gears"":
""The president, Miller recalled, asked how many troops the Pentagon planned to turn out the following day. ""We're like, 'We're going to provide any National Guard support that the District requests,'"" Miller responded. ""And (Trump) goes, 'You're going to need 10,000 people.' No, I'm not talking bullshit. He said that. And we're like, 'Maybe. But you know, someone's going to have to ask for it.'"" At that point Miller remembered the president telling him, ""'You do what you need to do. You do what you need to do.' He said, 'You're going to need 10,000.' That's what he said. Swear to God.""

Miller chalked it up at the time to Trump being ""hyperbolic,"" Vanity Fair reported. He told lawmakers months later that D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser's request for 340 members of the D.C. National Guard for traffic and crowd control was approved, but the Defense Department ""received no further request for different or additional support until the Capitol was breached."" Before the attack, Miller had signaled opposition to stationing the military outside the Capitol, according to the Defense Department's inspector general report.
""No other requests were made,"" then-Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said the day after the riot.
The Washington Post reported that the 10,000 figure did not get relayed to anyone outside of the Defense Department, citing unnamed former officials. A Defense Department spokesperson previously told PolitiFact that there was ""no record of such an order being given"" by Trump.
It's not clear how or when the number claimed jumped from 10,000 to 20,000 -- a number of troops that would have rivaled some of the largest National Guard deployments in history.

Texts between Fox News host Sean Hannity and former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany are displayed at the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, hearing on June 9, 2022, in Washington. (AP)
On his show June 9, Hannity brought on Patel, who has helped drive falsehoods in the past and has shared social media posts related to the QAnon conspiracy theory.
In contrast to what Miller told Vanity Fair and lawmakers, Patel told Hannity that in the pre-Jan. 6 meeting between Miller and Trump, Trump officially authorized up to 20,000 National Guard troops. Patel then claimed that they went to Pelosi and ""she refused it all,"" but he spoke only in vague terms when Hannity pressed for more information.
When PolitiFact emailed Patel for evidence that Trump had formally authorized 20,000 troops and Pelosi had refused it, a spokesperson pointed to the Defense Department's IG report and to the department's timeline for security planning on Jan. 6, 2021. 
Those documents, along with a bipartisan report from the Senate, indicate that members of the Capitol Police Board did have conversations in advance of the Jan. 6 attack about the possibility of seeking more National Guard support. The Pentagon communicated with the Capitol Police to see if they would require further assistance, the documents show, but no additional requests were made; the Senate report said the Capitol Police Board members ""did not appear to be fully familiar with the statutory and regulatory requirements for requesting National Guard support.""
The Capitol Police Board includes the Capitol Police chief and the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms, who report respectively to the House speaker and the Senate majority leader.
But neither document makes any reference to a request or authorization of 20,000 National Guard troops, or to Pelosi blocking one.  
Paul Irving, then the House Sergeant at Arms, testified in February 2021 that he did not speak with congressional leadership about potentially bringing in National Guard support until Jan. 6.
Plus, the Senate majority leader at the time was Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. -- not Schumer.
""Had President Trump ordered 20,000 National Guard soldiers to the Capitol before Jan. 6, it would have happened,"" said Dwight Stirling, the founder and CEO of the Center for Law and Military Policy. ""No one can prevent a presidential order from being followed with regard to where troops go or what they do. That it didn't occur is evidence that no such order was issued.""
Our ruling
Hannity said, ""Donald Trump authorized up to 20,000 National Guard troops to protect the Capitol"" before Jan. 6, 2021, but was ""rejected"" by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.
There is no record of Trump formally authorizing 20,000 National Guard troops prior to the Jan. 6 attack. There is also no record of Pelosi rejecting such an authorization -- and experts said she would not have had the authority to do so as House speaker. 
We rate Hannity's claim False.

104.MythofBallotWatermar,"



Quick Take
An audit of ballots and a forensic audit of voting equipment earlier this year found no problems in the 2020 elections in Maricopa County, Arizona. But debunked claims about voter fraud revealed by secret ""watermarks"" are flowing again on social media amid a Republican-led audit. County officials say no watermarks were used on the ballots.

Full Story
According to the Maricopa County Elections Department, nearly 2.1 million voters participated in the 2020 general elections in Maricopa County, the largest county in Arizona. President Joe Biden won the county by a margin of more than 45,000 votes over former President Donald Trump. Biden carried the state of Arizona by a closer margin of 10,457 votes.
The county takes steps before and after every election to ensure security and accuracy, including a hand-count audit of a ""statistically significant sample of ballots"" to be compared to the machine count. In 2020 that audit found 100% accuracy, according to county election officials.
Following claims of voter fraud from Republicans, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors also hired two independent voting system testing laboratories to conduct a forensic audit of the county's election equipment. The two firms, Pro V&V and SLI Compliance, reported in February that the election equipment and software passed all tests conducted during the forensic audit.
Yet baseless claims of voter fraud continued, and the Republican-led Arizona Senate hired Cyber Ninjas, a private, Florida-based cybersecurity company, to conduct another audit of the Maricopa County ballots.
Despite objections of the Arizona Democratic Party, the state Senate is paying Cyber Ninjas -- a company with no reported prior election audit experience -- $150,000 to conduct the audit. Christina Bobb, a host on the conservative network One America News, helped raise another $150,000 to help cover the costs. Cyber Ninjas Chief Executive Officer Doug Logan ""is a proud supporter of the 'Stop the Steal' movement and has retweeted numerous posts on Twitter claiming that the 2020 General Election was rigged against Donald Trump,"" according to a suit filed by the state Democratic Party to stop the partisan audit.
A state court in February ruled that the county must turn over all election equipment and materials for the audit. Maricopa County turned over nearly 2.1 million ballots, 385 Election Day tabulators, nine central count tabulators, and more than eight terabytes of data -- including tabulator logs, voter records, clones of servers and images of early ballot affidavits and ballot images -- to the Arizona Senate, which then gave the materials to Cyber Ninjas.
The audit by Cyber Ninjas -- which began April 23 and is expected to take several weeks -- has included the use of ultraviolet lights to see if watermarks were embedded in the ballots. Conspiracy theories surrounding watermarks on election ballots have been gaining traction since the 2020 presidential election, with QAnon followers falsely claiming official ballots were secretly watermarked by the Trump administration to ferret out the use of fraudulent ballots.
In November, we debunked false claims on social media that the Department of Homeland Security used watermarks on ""official ballots"" throughout the U.S.
Social media users have revived the bogus claim, however. A Facebook post on April 25 falsely claims, ""So it's official, there was in fact watermarks on the ballots in Arizona.""
A similar Instagram post shows a screenshot of a tweet posted by @Dino_Veletanlic reading: ""Donald Trump told us the 2020 election would be stolen via fake printed ballots. The media and left labeled us as conspiracy theorists. The Maricopa County audit is confirming the rumors, that a special watermark is on the real ballots.""
But those claims are false.
""Maricopa County election officials have stated that there are no watermarks on their ballots,"" Sophia Solis, spokeswoman for the Arizona Secretary of State, told us in an email. ""Misinformation and disinformation continue to be a serious threat to our democracy.""
On April 26, the Maricopa County Elections Department tweeted, ""A question we've been getting a lot today is about @MaricopaCounty ballots. Did you know there are NO watermarks on @MaricopaCounty ballots? Get more facts like this in our @MaricopaVote ""Just the Facts"" updates: http://bit.ly/JustTheFacts4-26-21.""
The ""Just the Facts"" web page states, ""There are many security measures in place when creating and printing ballots, but there are no secret markings on the ballot.""
The use of ultraviolet lights during the current audit raised concerns for election experts at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. It wrote a letter on April 29 to Chris Herren, chief of the voting section in the civil rights division at the Department of Justice, requesting that he deploy federal monitors to the location of the Arizona audit.
A public statement from the Brennan Center said that Cyber Ninjas' audit process risks ""compromising the integrity of the ballots themselves, using materials and technologies that will cause the ballot paper and marks to deteriorate, such as holding ballots to ultra-violet light without gloves.""
Ken Bennett, the state Senate Republicans' liaison for the audit, told PolitiFact on May 3 that the auditors did initially scan ballots with UV lights to see if there were watermarks, but they are no longer using the lights. Bennett also stated there was ""no evidence"" of watermark findings and ""findings would not be released in the middle of the audit anyway, that is pure speculation or made up whatever.""
Biden's victory in Arizona was certified by state officials -- including Republican Gov. Doug Ducey -- in November and Congress accepted those results on Jan. 6.
Solis, the spokeswoman for the secretary of state, also said, ""The election results have been certified and nothing that Cyber Ninjas does will alter the outcome.""

90.Videomakesitlooklike,"
A video spreading online claims to show Democrats and other left-leaning groups plotting a post-election coup if President Donald Trump won re-election, including the takeover of major U.S. cities and government buildings including the White House.
But the 34-minute video, posted on YouTube, was deceptively edited to make it look like the individuals in the video were coordinating a coup. They say they were actually discussing what to do in a nonviolent protest if Joe Biden wins and there is ""an attempt to ignore a democratic election.""
The video was posted by ""Millennial Millie,"" whose real name is Millicent Weaver. Weaver served as a correspondent for InfoWars.com, the website of conservative talk show host Alex Jones, who regularly shares unfounded conspiracy theories.  
""Regardless of who wins, the left plans to take over,"" Weaver says in the video. ""Our undercover inside the Sunrise Movement was able to obtain exclusive video footage inside Zoom chats where Shutdown DC, BLM and other leftist organizations are coordinating a multi-level coup-action exercise utilizing insider help from Democrat Party members as well as federal employees and intelligence contractors.""
Some of the people who appear in the video are, in fact, government employees from the Labor and Energy departments.
But participants say the video takes their discussion out of context.
Members of the the Sunrise Movement, a youth-led, anti-Trump initiative focused on climate change, said that ""right-wing extremist organizations"" are spreading false information about the organization, including heavily edited videos and two anonymous websites."" 
Sunrise previously told fact-checking organization Lead Stories that someone pretended to be interested in its initiative and recorded some of its Zoom meetings. The YouTube video was then re-ordered and pieced together into clips to make it appear like the participants were planning civil unrest if Trump won re-election.
The organization says it encourages voter and civic participation and focuses on ""ensuring a fair election and exerting public pressure on anyone that attempts to interfere in a democratic process.""
The video appears to combine multiple meetings and highlights various parts of the discussions. 
We've fact-checked claims about coups before. Coups are the sudden and illegal removal of the executive authority (such as the president) of an independent government. Coups are sometimes (but not always) violent. Peaceful protests and civil disobedience are not typical of coups. 
Some of the discussions in the video specifically reference coups, but the language seems intended for dramatic emphasis and to express their disdain for Trump. There are no specific plans made in the video to commit acts of violence or talk of installing a new president. 
Near the beginning of the video, one woman says, ""I think making sure that we are naming what is happening as a coup in communications with co-workers would be really important.""
Patrick Young, an organizer for Shut Down D.C., which describes itself as a space ""where individuals and groups can come together to organize direct action,"" talks about how to respond to different contested election scenarios. 
On his Twitter page, Young has openly shared the organization's plan for Election Day and beyond, which discusses actions to take to stop a potential ""coup"" In this case, the coup they seem to largely be referring to is Trump seizing an unearned victory, not activists commiting a coup themselves.
Fox News also wrote a story about the recorded meetings, saying that several leaked documents and Zoom call recordings described ""a loose but coordinated network of activists seeking to mobilize around the country, especially if Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden loses or if President Trump contests the election results.""
The news organization also acknowledged that it couldn't independently confirm the legitimacy of the recordings and documents with local and federal law enforcement, but noted that the FBI said its standard practice is to neither confirm nor deny an investigation. 
Weaver claims that the video's findings have been vetted by ""high-level analysts"" and ""seasoned journalists,"" without naming or citing them. 
Investigative researchers from First Draft, a nonprofit that fights online misinformation, found that different parts of the video show cuts and edits that aren't part of a continuous recording. Many of those cuts are obvious, and abruptly switch from one speaker to another.
A chat box on the side displays time stamps, and shows the YouTube video jumping back and forth. 
For example, at the beginning, the time stamp shows 7:22 p.m. The next part about a potential coup jumps back to 6:17 p.m., while the following discussion about the police station and media map jumps forward to 8:08 p.m.
The meetings appear to be legitimate, but Weaver's video is selectively edited and without being able to view the original footage, we are unable to get the complete context of these discussions. Many of the individuals featured are involved in activist organizations that regularly organize protests and various demonstrations, but we couldn't find evidence that they are planning a coup to take over whole cities, rather planning on how to respond to a coup.

73.AfterCallingUSCapito,"
A California state lawmaker from San Diego County and a Santa Clara County GOP party official are among Republicans nationwide who justified pro-Trump extremists violently attacking the U.S. Capitol last week.
Asm. Randy Voepel, who represents communities in eastern San Diego County, defended the insurrection as an effort to push back ""against tyranny,"" before later abandoning that position. 
""This is Lexington and Concord. First shots fired against tyranny,"" Voepel told the San Diego Union-Tribune in a news article published Jan. 9. ""Tyranny will follow in the aftermath of the Biden swear in on January 20th.""
He made the comments days after the Jan. 6 insurrection which left five people dead, including a U.S. Capitol police officer. Since then, many have called to  impeach President Donald Trump for his role in encouraging his supporters to march on the Capitol and ""take back our country."" 
In a statement released Monday, Voepel backtracked on his original comments and called last week's events ""unacceptable.""  
""In response to a quotation I made to a local newspaper, I would like to follow up to state clearly and unequivocally I do not condone or support the violence and lawlessness that took place on Wednesday, Jan. 6, at our nation's capital,"" Voepel's statement read. ""The loss of life, theft of government property, and blatant disregard for law and order is reprehensible and unnecessary, and I offer my prayers and condolences for the families reeling from the recent loss of their loved ones."" 
""The events that took place last Wednesday, as unacceptable as they were, are a sign of the deep division currently facing our nation,"" he continued. ""That is why it is especially important that each of us work extra hard to heal the divisions between us.""
Asm. Lorena Gonzalez (D - San Diego) condemned Voepel's original statement, calling it ""outrageous and irresponsible. We should expect better.""
Katie Talbot, a spokesperson for Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D - Los Angeles) declined to say whether Voepel will face any consequences. In a written statement, Rendon called on all members of the chamber ""to avoid inflaming passions."" 
""I would instead ask people -- Members and their constituents -- to be vigilant to protect our Constitution,"" the statement continued. ""We need broad public involvement to counter those who weaken democracy with brute force and lies.""
According to reporting from the Associated Press, lawmakers from at least seven states traveled to Washington D.C. to take part in the demonstrations, which are rooted in the baseless conspiracy theory that Joe Biden stole the presidential election. None were identified as California lawmakers. 
Ashli E. Babbitt, 35, a San Diego woman and ardent Trump supporter, was shot and killed by an officer after she broke into the U.S. Capitol and then climbed up toward a broken section of an interior doorway that rioters were trying to breach. 
On the day of the riots, Phil Reynolds, an elected member of the Santa Clara County Republican party, took to Facebook to say ""The war has begun! Citizens take arms!""

Those comments led to calls for Reynolds to resign, but the GOP party official told ABC7 News Bay Area that he has no plans to do so. 
""I'm not going to retract my comments,"" Reynolds said. ""They were not anything derogatory toward any individual. They were not inciting violence.""
The county GOP party did not respond to questions about whether it plans to sanction Reynolds, who could not be reached for comment. In a Facebook post on Jan. 9, the local party released the following: 
""The Santa Clara County Republican Central Committee categorically repudiates those who call for and participate in efforts to foment political violence or mob rule,"" the post read. ""We are a Republic that works its problems out through discourse, laws, elections, and constitutional processes. Violence has no place in that environment.""
Wesley Hussey, a Sacramento State University political science professor, said comments like those made by Voepel and Reynolds are politically damaging even in very Republican parts of California. 
""Both cases are going to be a problem for Republicans,"" he said. 
Hours after the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol building, more than 100 Republicans in Congress, including seven from California, objected to certifying the electoral votes from Arizona and Pennsylvania. Supporters of the president allege election fraud and irregularities in the two swing states, despite a lack of evidence and legal challenges that went nowhere.

336.Nearly200000Floridav,"
As President Donald Trump floated baseless claims about fraud in the counting of ballots in Florida, his son chimed in on Twitter to imply that the state had a huge number of noncitizen voters.
""Amazing, but not shocking at all anymore. Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Nearly-200000-Florida-Voters-May-Not-Be-Citizens-151212725.html ... via @nbc6,"" Donald Trump Jr. tweeted on Nov. 12.
Amazing, but not shocking at all anymore. Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens https://t.co/8HiObPLeeM via @nbc6-- Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) November 12, 2018


The tweet drew more than 28,000 likes in less than 24 hours. But it isn't accurate. It is based on a cherry-picked number from a headline that didn't tell the full story back in 2012.
At the outset of the state's effort to purge noncitizens from the voter rolls, state officials came up with the list of about 182,000 names. But Trump Jr. omits that the final number of noncitizens purged was a tiny speck of that original number.
When examined in the context of all the registered voters -- or even ballots cast -- in Florida or the nation, proven voter fraud by noncitizens is rare.
History of noncitizen purge
Florida engaged in a controversial attempt to search for noncitizen voters leading up to the 2012 election. The search was rife with errors, and was ultimately dropped after few were found.
Shortly after Republican Gov. Rick Scott took office in 2011, he asked his top election official at the time to look into removing noncitizens from the voter rolls.
By 2012, the Division of Elections put together a list of potential noncitizens based on driver's license data.
Trump cited a headline from early in that process. He linked to a May 2012 story on NBC Miami's website headlined: ""2012Election: Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens."" The story was written by the Associated Press.
Why was the president's son sharing a six-year-old story?
Matthew Gertz of the liberal Media Matters website noted that before Trump Jr.'s tweet, conservative pundits publicized the 2012 story. David Wohl, the father of conspiracy theorist Jacob Wohl, tweeted a link to the story on Nov. 10, as did Harlan Hill and Charlie Kirk.

Esta grabacion muestra una llamada al 911 de los migrantes atrapados en un camion en San Antonio, Texas.












By Nuria Diaz Munoz * June 30, 2022







On Nov. 12 before Trump Jr.'s tweet, NBC Miami included an editor's note on top of the original story. First, it reminded readers that the story was published in 2012. Then, it went over the history lesson of how the state's list contained errors:

The AP had reported that the initial list turned up nearly 182,000 people who may not be U.S. citizens, based on the driver's license data. Of that group, the state sent an initial list of more than 2,600 voters' names to county election supervisors.
As we have reported and the NBC editor's note points out, the state ultimately whitted the list and removed 85 voters because they were ""not a U.S. citizen.""
Supervisors had noted all sorts of errors and later used words such as ""sloppy"" and ""embarrassing"" to describe the state initiative, PolitiFact found. One of the problems was that the driver's license data doesn't get updated when a legal resident later becomes a citizen.
By September 2012, when the Division of Elections produced a new list of about 200 ineligible voters, supervisors were fed up, and the effort appeared to fizzle as the presidential election drew near.
The state said it would launch yet another effort to purge noncitizens from the voter rolls almost a year later, but scrapped it.
We were unable to find any other sort of comprehensive data on noncitizen voters removed in Florida. We reached out to the state Division of Elections but did not hear back by deadline.
Jason Snead tracks proven instances of election fraud in the U.S. for the conservative Heritage Foundation, which includes cases that resulted in criminal convictions, fines or an official finding of fraud. He said the database shows 13 entries from Florida involving a noncitizen who successfully registered and/or voted in an election. These cases were from 2003-06.
A May 2017 report by New York University's Brennan Center for Justice found that election officials in 42 jurisdictions referred an estimated 30 incidents of suspected noncitizen voting for further investigation or prosecution out of more than 23 million votes.
""The kind of instances in which an individual voter tries to pretend to be somebody else or votes when he or she isn't eligible are not the statistically meaningful events that we need to be worried about,"" Myrna Perez, director of the center's Voting Rights and Elections project and co-author of the study, said to the Austin American-Statesman.
Our ruling
As Florida underwent a recount of three key races, Trump Jr. tweeted a headline that said ""nearly 200,000 Florida voters may not be citizens."" He said it was ""amazing, but not shocking at all anymore.""
It's actually not true, and years old.
The story itself provides a more complete picture -- and an editor's note with clarifications that Trump overlooked. The state's 2012 voter purge started with a list of potentially 182,000 noncitizens on the voter rolls. State officials whittled that list to more than 2,600 names sent to county election supervisors. Ultimately 85 noncitizens were removed.
We rate this claim False.

00.WasJeffreyEpsteinSpo,"
Some conspiracy theories refuse to die. In October 2020, ABQ RAW -- a self-described ""guerrilla filmmaking"" news organization -- posted a YouTube video claiming that they had visited Jeffrey Epstein's ranch between Santa Fe and Albuquerque, New Mexico, and spotted a man there who they believed was Epstein.
Epstein was a financier and convicted sex offender, who died in August 2019 while awaiting trial in a New York jail. 





The man is seen pulling up in a truck around 50 seconds into the video. The caption for the video says: ""Jeffrey Epstein may have not killed himself and may be still be alive. We visited the Zorro Ranch recently and saw some interesting things. Take a look at the video and see if Jeffrey Epstein is in fact alive and well.""
According to the people behind the video, they saw a red truck pull up as they were filming, and a man inside it held up his phone to record them. Based on a very blurry zoom, the man was said to look like Epstein. The video concludes with the question: ""Did Jeffrey Epstein kill himself? It may be completely possible that he has ridden off into the New Mexico sunset.""
We know that this is completely false. Multiple reputable sources have confirmed to the media before that Epstein is in fact dead, including Dr. Barbara Sampson, the chief medical examiner in New York City, who ruled his death a suicide by hanging. Dr. Michael Baden, a forensic pathologist hired by Epstein's brother, disputed the official findings and claimed that he had been strangled instead. Baden also observed the autopsy done by city officials.
Epstein's Zorro Ranch, known for being the place where many of his accusers say they were trafficked and raped, is comprised of both public and private property. In 2019, state officials said they were trying to seize the land.
Given that multiple experts confirmed Epstein's autopsy took place, and one cannot have an autopsy without a dead body, we know that Epstein was certainly not on the ranch, and therefore rate this claim as ""False.""

Additional reading: What Happens If Donald Trump Doesn't Concede?
On Nov. 7, The Associated Press projected that Joe Biden would become the 46th president of the United States. Meanwhile, conspiracy theories have plagued social media both before and after Election Day, many purporting to describe widespread voter fraud. However, no evidence exists of any widespread voter irregularities.
In fact, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a Nov. 12 statement that reported the 2020 U.S. presidential election was ""the most secure in American history."" The Associated Press reported:
It's hard to put it any more bluntly: ""There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes or was in any way compromised.""
Rejecting President Donald Trump's persistent claims and complaints, a broad coalition of top government and industry officials is declaring that the Nov. 3 voting and the following count unfolded smoothly with no more than the usual minor hiccups.
It was, they declare, resorting to Trump's sort of dramatic language, ""the most secure in American history.""
On Nov. 17, President Donald Trump fired Christopher Krebs, the director of CISA, the same organization that issued the statement quoted by the Associated Press. Krebs was a Trump appointee. 






More than two weeks after Election Day, one of the more persistent rumors on social media claimed that the 12th Amendment would give Trump a ""path to victory"" because of ""evidence of massive and coordinated voter fraud in key swing states."" The rumor also said that Republican-controlled state legislatures in states where Biden won would perhaps decline to certify results, or vote to allow Trump electors to replace Biden electors.
One Trump supporter tweeted: ""Let's just wait for the 12th Amendment to take place! Trump wins!"" Another tweet that received thousands of retweets and likes read: ""It's actually kinda convenient that Democrats are so ignorant of the Constitution because they have no idea what the 12th Amendment is about to do to them.""

Graham Ledger, a former host of a prime-time show on One America News (OAN), a far-right cable news network, also tweeted that state legislatures run by Republican majorities needed to ""stand up for 'We the People,'"" effectively asking politicians to do the opposite by overturning the will of the people based on debunked conspiracy theories:

The tweet claimed that Trump could win and be inaugurated for a second term on Jan. 20, 2021, because of the 12th Amendment and Article II, Section 1, both of which address the electoral-vote process. Ledger described Trump's purported ""path to victory"" in the video linked in the tweet, with the ""path to victory"" portion running from 26:58-32:39.
In sum, Ledger claimed there was a ""constitutional path to victory"" in Article II, Section 1 and the 12th Amendment, ""to not allow all the votes to be certified,"" because there was ""evidence of massive and coordinated voter fraud."" This was false. Graham pushed debunked conspiracy theories about purported ""fraud"" taking place in connection to Dominion Voting Software.
Ledger also said that states with Republican-led legislatures don't have to certify the ballots cast by its citizens, and instead, states can simply ignore the fact that more American citizens voted for Biden in Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. He said state legislatures should choose to not certify results, and wait for a vote in the House of Representatives. He linked all of this to the ""voter fraud"" for which there has been no evidence. He also referred to it as ""malfeasance."" 






The Post-Election Electoral Process
After the American people vote in a presidential election, each state certifies its results after all votes are counted. Following certification, the state's electors cast votes for the state. In 2020, that date was set for Dec. 14. For example, if a majority of votes in a state were for Trump, and that state has 16 votes in the Electoral College, then 16 Republican electors would end up voting on behalf of the state for Trump and Mike Pence on Dec. 14. The same would go for a state where a majority of voters chose Biden on their ballots.
Electors are chosen for each party, meaning that half of all electors that were chosen don't end up voting in December if their party doesn't win in a particular state. For example, Trump won the state of Mississippi, meaning that Democratic electors chosen by Election Day would not vote in December.
The Brookings Institution noted that when electors vote in December, ""the winning side in all but Maine and Nebraska gets all the state's electoral votes regardless of the popular vote division."" The National Archives detailed that Maine and Nebraska ""have proportional distribution of the electors,"" and ""the State winner receives two electors and the winner of each congressional district (who may be the same as the overall winner or a different candidate) receives one elector. This system permits Nebraska and Maine to award electors to more than one candidate.""
The 12th Amendment
The 12th Amendment describes the procedure for electors choosing a president and vice president, and what to do in the event of a tie in the Electoral College. A tie did not occur in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, nor is it expected to occur when electors meet to vote for their respective states in December.
It's unclear why Graham Ledger and others have cited the 12th Amendment as the ""path to victory"" for Trump, seeing as it does not provide a path to victory.
""Faithless Electors""
In 2020, electors for each state and the District of Columbia will vote for president and vice president on Dec. 14, but according to Business Insider, some may certify results by Dec. 8. 






When the electors cast votes by Dec. 14, a U.S. Supreme Court ruling from July 6 may receive mentions in newspapers and on blogs. The Associated Press reported that the court unanimously ruled that ""states can require presidential electors to back their states' popular vote winner in the Electoral College.""
The ruling, in cases in Washington state and Colorado just under four months before the 2020 election, leaves in place laws in 32 states and the District of Columbia that bind electors to vote for the popular-vote winner, as electors almost always do anyway.
So-called ""faithless electors"" have not been critical to the outcome of a presidential election, but that could change in a race decided by just a few electoral votes. It takes 270 electoral votes to win the presidency.
A state may instruct ""electors that they have no ground for reversing the vote of millions of its citizens,"" Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her majority opinion that walked through American political and constitutional history with an occasional nod to pop culture.
The Associated Press projected that President-elect Biden had 306 votes in the Electoral College to Trump's 232. A difference of 74 votes is not ""just a few electoral votes.""
Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania
Ledger's tweet specifically mentioned Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.
Georgia is not one of the 32 states with ""faithless elector"" laws, meaning that Georgia's electors are not bound by law to vote for the candidate in the winning party. However, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that its 16 electors ""are avowed Biden supporters who have worked for years to flip Georgia, which last voted for a Democrat for president in 1992."" The Democratic electors were not expected to surprisingly vote for Trump on Dec. 14, especially after a state audit was conducted, which is similar to a recount. On Nov. 19, following the audit, the Associated Press called the race for Joe Biden.
Unlike Georgia, the two Big Ten Conference states of Wisconsin and Michigan are two of the 32 states that do, in fact, have ""faithless elector"" laws. This means that, following Biden's wins in both states, their Democratic electors would be bound by law to vote for their party's candidate on Dec. 14. Wisconsin has 10 electors, and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that electors were ""unlikely go against the popular vote."" Michigan has 16 electors, and all are expected to vote for Biden. Additionally, for example, Michigan Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, the state's GOP leader, told the nonprofit publication Bridge Michigan that Biden won the election, and that the Michigan Legislature would not take action to give Trump electors over Biden.
Shirkey and the Republican speaker of the Michigan House, Lee Chatfield, were summoned to meet with Trump at the White House on Nov. 20. Chatfield previously tweeted on Nov. 6: ""Let me be very clear: whoever gets the most votes will win Michigan! Period. End of story. Then we move on."" Shirkey also told Bridge Michigan that he recommended Trump should begin helping Biden's transition team. 






A debacle involving Republican canvassers' refusal to certify results in Wayne County, Michigan, the state's most populous county, was not expected to stop Biden's victory in the state. A court order or the state board were named as ways of likely resolving the situation.
The state of Pennsylvania does not have a ""faithless elector"" law. Marie Albiges for Spotlight PA reported that Pennsylvania's Democratic electors ""are state and local elected officials, political party leaders, and others who traditionally have strong connections to the party."" Derek Muller, a law professor at the University of Iowa, told Spotlight PA that ""they tend to be loyal, partisan, and faithful to the party, and 'will reliably transfer the preferences of voters.'""
State Legislatures
Ledger's tweet also mentioned that because of ""evidence of massive and coordinated voter fraud,"" Republican legislatures ""need to stand up for We the People!"" However, American citizens already cast their votes in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. There has been no evidence of ""massive and coordinated voter fraud."" A state legislature's vote to overturn the will of its citizens based on the absence of evidence was not expected to occur.
On Nov. 19, Reuters reported that Trump had lobbied Republican-controlled state legislatures where Joe Biden won to vote instead to give electoral votes to the president:
Asked at a news conference on Thursday if the campaign's aim was to block state certifications so Republican lawmakers could pick electors, Giuliani laughed and said the goal was to get around what he called an ""outrageous iron curtain of censorship.""
Election officials and experts believe the Trump campaign has little chance of success.
""The results in Michigan and Pennsylvania are not particularly close, and the Trump campaign has come forth with no facts or legal theory that would justify disenfranchising hundreds of thousands of voters or throwing out the election results,"" said Rick Hasen, an expert on election law at the University of California, Irvine, School of Law.
""This is a dangerous though almost certainly ineffective attempt to thwart the will of the voters or to delegitimize a Biden presidency based upon false claims of a stolen election,"" he said.
Voting in the U.S. House of Representatives
Ledger's video mentioned that he wanted states to not certify results, so that down the line the U.S. House would have to take up the matter.
It's not expected to come before the House in this manner, but hypothetically, if it did, each state would have one vote, and each vote would depend on whether the state had a majority of Democratic or Republican members. Donald Brand, a professor at College of the Holy Cross, described the situation in The Conversation:
If neither candidate gets to 270 electors due to disputed ballots, the House would have to decide the election.
Though the House has a Democratic majority, such an outcome would almost certainly benefit Trump. Here's why: In a concession to small states concerned their voices would be marginalized if the House was called upon to choose the president, the founders gave only one vote to each state. House delegations from each state meet to decide how to cast their single vote.
That voting procedure gives equal representation to California - population 40 million - and Wyoming, population 600,000.
No ""Path to Victory""
In following the U.S. Constitution, there is no longer a realistic ""path to victory"" for Trump in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Ledger, Trump attorney Sidney Powell, and others claimed there was evidence of massive and coordinated voter fraud or irregularities in key swing states. However, there has been no evidence presented, and on top of that, CISA said the 2020 election was ""the most secure in American history.""
It appeared that, with Trump's defeat, his supporters and those who represent him were attempting to find a way for state governments to overturn the will of the people so that he could serve two consecutive terms. For this to happen, several states would need to work in concert to disregard millions of ballots cast by American citizens, instead finding a way for Trump to continue for four more years in the White House, even after losing the popular vote by nearly 6 million votes.

Says an image shows the Highland Park shooting suspect ""in jail or rehab or a psychiatric center"" before the shooting.












By Bill McCarthy * July 5, 2022







The late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein did have a big ranch outside Santa Fe, N.M., called Zorro Ranch and it appears to be the same property that's shown in the Facebook video. On multiple occasions, according to the New York Times, Epstein talked to scientists and businessmen about his hopes to use the ranch as a base where women would be inseminated with his sperm and give birth to his babies. 
Epstein -- a multimillionaire, not billionaire, as the Facebook video says -- died in jail, where he was being held on charges of child sex trafficking. The New York City medical examiner and U.S. Attorney General William Barr have both said Epstein died of suicide but conspiracy theories about his death persist. President Donald Trump, among others, have suggested that Epstein was killed in custody.
But we found nothing to corroborate the claim in this Facebook video. 
In August 2019, we fact-checked and rated Pants on Fire a claim that Epstein isn't dead. Back then, the medical examiner had yet to release his final ruling on how Epstein died, but numerous people in official positions confirmed that he was, in fact, dead.
The U.S. Bureau of Prisons announced his death. One of Epstein's lawyers blamed prosecutors and the Manhattan Correctional Center, where Epstein was held, for his client's death. And federal prosecutors then said that their investigation of those suspected of helping Epstein would continue despite his death.

Recent fires at food processing plants across the United States have sparked several conspiracy theories that someone is setting them intentionally in order to hasten a food shortage.
""None of the other scams worked, so now they'll attempt to starve us,"" read an April 21 Facebook post. It shared a screenshot of a tweet that notes an ""odd coincidence"" that ""18 U.S. food processing facilities burned down in the last six months.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
Knowing the facts has never been more important. Please consider donating to PolitiFact today.

(Screengrab from Facebook)
 
It's not clear what anyone would have to gain by starving Americans -- though at least one post suggests that Bill Gates would -- but the conspiracy theory is spreading like, um, wildfire on social media and conservative websites.
 
Fox News host Tucker Carlson added fuel by noting two other recent fires and asking in an April 22 segment, ""What is going on here, exactly?"" 
 
Carlson said in the past week that small planes crashed at a General Mills plant in Georgia (it crashed near the plant, which was not damaged) and the Gem State Processing Plant in Idaho. In that crash, a pilot delivering packages for UPS died in a crash that her father told a local newspaper was due to unsafe conditions caused by steam from a nearby chimney at the plant. The plant itself did not appear to suffer much damage, photos of the scene show.
 
We looked at each of the 18 fires mentioned in the Facebook post and found no evidence that any of them were intentionally set. 
Twelve were either ruled accidental, or no foul play was suspected. One was at a vacant building that once housed a meat plant. In five others, the fires are either still under investigation or investigators have not publicly announced any cause found -- intentional or otherwise.

Some of the plants were completely destroyed or heavily damaged, while others suffered minor damage with little impact on food production. Though the post said the 18 fires happened in the past six months, only 12 of those happened in that time frame.
 
Fires at large food processing plants can have a big effect on the nation's food supply. Four large companies account for about 70% U.S. beef production, according to data from the North American Meat Institute. A 2019 blaze at a Tyson's beef processing plant in Holcomb, Kansas, halted production there for four months, causing numerous supply chain and pricing issues.
 
The American Association of Meat Processors said in a statement to PolitiFact that there doesn't appear to be any evidence of a deliberate attack on the food industry in the cases cited in the Facebook post.
 
Tom Super, senior vice president of communications at the National Chicken Council, a trade group that represents chicken producers, also doesn't see any cause for concern.
 
""I can only speak for chicken, but like any manufacturing plant/industry, there are generally a few fires that occur each year across the country. Most of them are contained rather quickly, and certainly not enough to affect the chicken supply,"" Super said. ""There are about 200 federally inspected chicken slaughtering plants in the U.S. and thousands more that further process chicken. I would not categorize this as an 'alarming trend.'""
 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture said on its website that there are currently no food shortages or widespread disruptions of the food supply in the country, although availability of some products may be temporarily low at times.
 
And PolitiFact recently spoke with food experts who said that even if the war in Ukraine affects supplies elsewhere, the U.S. is largely self-sufficient.
 
Here's what we know about the fires
* A fire destroyed the headquarters of Azure Standard, a distributor of organic food in Dufur, Oregon. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, the company said in a press release on April 19. It said a few product lines may be affected, but the impact on operations should be ""limited and temporary.""
* A fire destroyed a Taylor Farms Processing Facility in Salinas, California, on April 13. The company produces and distributes wholesale salad products and will now shift production to its Arizona facility. The company's CEO told KSBW Action News that it plans to rebuild the facility and that the fire was likely the result of a welding accident. 
* An April 12 fire destroyed the East Conway Beef & Pork butcher shop and slaughterhouse in Conway, New Hampshire. The cause of the blaze is still under investigation as of April 22, according to the New Hampshire State Fire Marshal's office.
* A fire that destroyed the Penobscot McCrum potato processing plant in Belfast, Maine, on March 24 was accidental, the Associated Press reported. Officials believe it started in a large deep-frying machine, according to the Portland Press-Herald.
* A March 16 fire caused extensive damage to a new production line dedicated to Hot Pockets at a Nestle plant in Jonesboro, Arkansas. But that fire was not the result of foul play or anything suspicious, but rather a welding accident, Jonesboro Fire Chief Kevin Miller said.
* A propane boiler explosion caused a fire that destroyed the Shearer's Foods potato chip plant in northeast Oregon on Feb. 22. It's not clear if the company will rebuild there, but its website said that it has 12 production plants.
* A fire destroyed a building that used to be the home of the Bonanza Meat Co. in El Paso, Texas, on Feb. 15. The building had been vacant for several years, according to a local CBS affiliate.
* A fire destroyed part of the Wisconsin River Meats site in Mauston on Feb. 3. The business serves as a meat processor for farmers, livestock producers and hunters in the region, and also has a retail shop. The cause of that blaze was construction-related, David Mauer, the company's vice president and owner, told PolitiFact. The company was fulfilling pickup orders at its warehouse three days later and opened a new storefront on April 21.

* An explosion and fire damaged the Cargill-Nutrena plant in Lecompte, Louisiana, on Jan. 13. Cargill-Nutrena did not return a request for comment and it's not clear if the site, which produces animal feed, had to halt production.
* A fire did extensive damage to a poultry processing plant in Hamilton, Ontario, on Jan. 6, according to CHCH-TV. The cause of the blaze wasn't clear from news reports. We reached out to Hamilton fire officials for comment but have not heard back.
* A food processing plant in San Antonio, Texas, suffered about $100,000 in smoke damage, mostly to food, after a cooler was found on fire on Dec. 13, 2021, according to KSAT-12 news.
* A Nov. 29, 2021, fire at the Maid-Rite Steak Company meat processing plant in Scott Township, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, was determined by fire officials to be an accident, according to Fox56 News. The plant was left inoperable and some products that were only produced there are no longer available, the company, which has other plants, said on its website.
* A fire at the JVS USA beef processing plant in Grand Island, Nebraska, on Sept, 12, 2021, only halted production for one day. The cause of the fire was determined to be from a heater near the roof in the rendering area of the plant, according to Drovers, a beef industry trade publication.
* A fire temporarily closed Patak Meat Products in Cobb County, Georgia, on Aug. 23, 2021. No foul play was suspected, officials said. The company said on Facebook in March that it is still rebuilding, but is open for business.
* A fire broke out at Tyson's River Valley Ingredients rendering plant, which produces animal feed, in Hanceville, Alabama, on July 31, 2021. That blaze appeared to start with grease and animal by-products, the town's mayor told the Cullman Tribune. Tyson announced on April 18, 2022, that it is building a new $208 million plant near the one lost in the blaze.
* A fire that damaged a Kellogg's plant in Memphis, Tennessee, on July 25, 2021, was accidentally sparked when a malfunctioning conveyer belt sparked a blaze in a rice drying machine, fire officials said. We reached out to Kellogg's to find the effect on production at the plant, but did not receive a response.
* A fire at the Smithfield Foods pork processing plant in Monmouth, Illinois, on April 30, 2021, caused ""not a lot of damage"" to the building, according to a local news report. A spokesperson for the Illinois State Fire Marshal said the fire was accidental and no foul play was suspected. He also said the office has not noticed any trends in fires at meat packing sites in the state.
* A Jan. 11, 2021, fire destroyed the Deli Star meat processing plant in Fayetteville, Illinois. No foul play was suspected in that fire, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. A replacement facility is set to open in 2022.
Our ruling
A Facebook post alleges that fires at 18 food processing plants in the past six months are the result of an intentional attempt to ""starve"" Americans.
But of the 18 fires listed, 12 were ruled accidental, two are still officially under investigation, and no official cause has been announced on three others. One was in Canada. One was at a vacant building. And 12 happened in the past six months.
There is no evidence that any of the fires were intentional. There also is no evidence that these fires have resulted in a food shortage crisis in the U.S. that could lead to starvation. We rate this claim False.
UPDATE, April 28, 2022: This story has been updated with additional information on the Smithfield Foods fire, which was determined to be accidental. The rating is unchanged.

Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, following months of military buildup and, as we've written, repeated denials by Russian officials that their country planned to invade.
As is often the case with major news events, we have seen several false and misleading claims made on social media and by politicians related to the conflict.

Below is a list of the claims that we have fact-checked:

Conspiracy theories aimed at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have been circulating on social media since Russia invaded Ukraine. One recent example, falsely attributed to a ""Pentagon official,"" is the unfounded claim that Zelensky is the cousin of billionaire philanthropist George Soros.

See ""Zelensky and Soros Aren't Cousins, Contrary to Social Media Claim"" for more.

A recent Facebook post falsely claims that CNN footage from the war in Ukraine was faked, citing a firefighter's jacket bearing the name of a Canadian city. But the footage was shot in Ukraine. The jacket was donated by a Canadian organization.

See ""CNN Video Shows Canadian Fire Gear Donated to Ukraine, Not 'Fake Footage'"" for more.

Amid rising tensions between the U.S. and Russia over the invasion of Ukraine, a misleading photo posted March 22 on Facebook shows an American fighter jet intercepting a Russian bomber near Alaskan airspace. But the incident was not related to the current situation in Ukraine; the photo appeared in an article published in Aero Magazine in June 2020.

See ""Viral Photo of Russian Bomber Shows Incident from 2020"" for more.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has triggered a barrage of false claims on social media, including a video that purports to show ""crisis actors"" portraying dead war victims. The video is actually from a climate protest held in Vienna, Austria, weeks before the war in Ukraine began.

See ""Video Shows Climate Protest in Austria, Not 'Crisis Actors' in Ukraine"" for more.

Zelensky has appeared in several recent videos that show he has remained in the country since Russia invaded. But a post on Facebook falsely claimed he fled and recorded a video using a green screen to make it appear as though he's still in Ukraine. There's no evidence to support the claim. A digital forensics expert told us that nothing in the video indicates it was filmed using a green screen.

See ""Zelensky Remains in Ukraine, Despite False Claims on Social Media"" for more.

Russian planes bombed a hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine, on March 9, killing three people and injuring at least 17, including two pregnant women seen in photos shared around the world. Social media posts falsely claimed one woman ""posed"" as the two women. One of the women died of her injuries, along with her baby; the other gave birth to a daughter.

See ""Social Media Posts Misrepresent Victims of Hospital Bombed in Mariupol"" for more.

Several megachurches in the U.S. were actively raising funds to support Ukrainians after the Russian invasion. But social media posts falsely claimed that ""we haven't seen a single American mega church offer anything to the Ukrainians.""

See ""Megachurches in U.S. Are Supporting Ukraine Relief, Contrary to Social Media Posts"" for more.

A video from 2019 showing Russian President Vladimir Putin meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un circulated with the false claim that it showed Putin meeting recently with the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in.

See ""Old, Mislabeled Video Circulating Amid Russia's Invasion of Ukraine"" for more.

Former President Donald Trump is one of several Republican politicians to claim or suggest that President Joe Biden ended the ""energy independence"" America needs to stop relying on Russia for oil. But the U.S. has imported oil and other forms of energy from abroad, including from Russia, for many years. On March 8, Biden signed an executive order blocking new U.S. purchases of Russian oil and other energy.

See ""Examining U.S. 'Energy Independence' Claims"" for more.

Rothschild & Co. has an office in Moscow and has been operating in Russia since the mid-1990s. Yet posts on social media falsely claimed that Russia had barred the Rothschild banking family from doing business in the country. The claim is an adaptation of an old conspiracy theory about the family.

See ""Rothschild & Co. Has Office in Russia, Contrary to Conspiracy Claim on Social Media"" for more.

Hunter Biden served on the board of the Ukrainian oil and gas company Burisma Holdings from 2014 to 2019. But Ted Nugent posted a Facebook meme falsely insinuating that Hunter's payments from the company ended with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

See ""Hunter Biden Left Ukrainian Company in 2019, Contrary to Ted Nugent Post"" for more.

The U.S. Department of Defense's Biological Threat Reduction Program has provided technical support to improve and protect Ukraine's public health laboratories. Social media posts, however, falsely claimed the program created ""bioweapons labs"" that are being targeted by Russian forces as part of the invasion of Ukraine.

See ""Social Media Posts Misrepresent U.S.-Ukraine Threat Reduction Program"" for more.

""Bernie Gores"" was not killed in Afghanistan in August, and he wasn't the ""first American casualty of the Ukraine crisis."" He doesn't exist. But Facebook users were faked out by fabricated tweets that purported to show CNN announcing the death of the same man twice in six months. The photo of ""Gores"" used in both fake tweets was video gamer Jordie Jordan.

See ""Bogus Tweet Spreads False Account of 'First American Casualty' in Ukraine"" for more.

Putin and other officials repeatedly denied having plans to invade Ukraine in the run-up to the assault. They blamed the U.S., Ukraine and others for the tension, insisting that Russia was a ""peaceful country"" and that it was ""not going to attack anyone.""

22.IsObamaClaimingKenya,"
On July 29, 2019, an obscure website called End of the Age Headlines published an article headlined ""Obama Will Claim Kenyan Citizenship to Keep from Being Tried for Treason.""
That article read (in its entirety) as follows:
LLEGAL COMMANDER IN CHIEF: Barack Obama will soon admit to having been born in Kenya, in an attempt to avoid being prosecuted for treason. It's already been proven that his birth certificate is a phony. Q has even said that he will claim Kenyan citizenship to keep from being charged for treason. Now, if he claims Kenyan citizenship, that means he was a false president, in which case every decision this man has made is now null and void, including the two Supreme Court justices!
Everything stated in that brief article was incorrect:

Obama's birth certificate has not been proved ""phony."" In fact, it has been verified by the original issuing authority, the Hawaii Department of Health, and that certificate -- along with considerable other evidence -- documents that Barack Obama was born in Hawaii and thus is a native-born citizen of the U.S.
Even if Barack Obama were not a native-born citizen of the U.S., and thus was ineligible to hold the office of president of the U.S., no provision in U.S. law exists for retroactively invalidating the actions of a president who improperly attained office.
No credible information supports the notion that Obama undertook any particular actions for which he is about to be, or even could be, ""tried for treason."" Article 3, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution very narrowly defines the crime of treason: ""Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort."" As University of California Davis law Professor Carlton F.W. Larson noted in an article on the subject, under that definition, ""Speaking against the government, undermining political opponents, supporting harmful policies or even placing the interests of another nation ahead of those of the United States are not acts of treason under the Constitution.""
Even if Obama were (about) to be tried for treason and had in fact been born in Kenya (neither of which appears remotely true), his simply claiming Kenyan citizenship at this juncture would not necessarily protect him from the consequences. As Larson noted, the notion that only U.S. citizens can commit treason against the U.S. is a myth: ""[T]he offense of treason can be committed by any person who owes allegiance to the United States, and this can include noncitizens. Treason law recognizes two kinds of allegiance: permanent and temporary. U.S. citizens owe permanent allegiance to the United States, and this duty carries with them wherever they go in the world. By contrast, noncitizens in the United States (other than ambassadors and their staffs) owe a duty of temporary allegiance, the Supreme Court found in an 1872 case. While they are within the United States and receiving protection from it, noncitizens are governed by American treason law. If a person on a green card or a student or tourist visa, for example, wages war against the United States or provides aid and comfort to our enemies, he cannot escape a treason prosecution simply by asserting his foreign citizenship.""

In fact, the End of the Age Headlines article was cribbed from a piece published by the Right Wing Watch website, which revealed that the ""Obama Will Claim Kenyan Citizenship to Keep from Being Tried for Treason"" rumor was based on nothing more than wild and unsupported speculation delivered in a YouTube video by a ""radical right-wing conspiracy theorist"":
During his recent appearance on Tiffany FitzHenry's YouTube program, radical right-wing conspiracy theorist and so-called ""firefighter prophet"" Mark Taylor claimed that Barack Obama will soon admit to having been born in Kenya in an attempt to avoid being prosecuted for treason.
""I don't think the guy is American,"" Taylor said. ""It's already been proven that that birth certificate is a phony.""
Taylor insisted that the issue of Obama's birth certificate is vitally important because it is the key to effectively negating his entire presidency, citing the QAnon conspiracy theory which claims that high-ranking intelligence officials in the Trump administration are leaking information about a secret plan to take down a global network of satanic pedophiles that includes prominent Democratic Party entertainment, political and business figures.

073.MelaniaTrumpBansMons,"
On 30 May 2017, web sites began posting reports stating that First Lady Melania Trump had banned all food products containing ingredients associated with the multinational agrochemical company Monsanto:
First Lady Melania Trump has banned Monsanto products from the White House after learning of the health effects associated with consuming genetically modified (GM) corn, according to reports.
While public debate rages about the safety of genetically modified food, Melania Trump says that as far as she is concerned, GM products are best avoided.
""Barron's health has improved out of sight since we started eating organic, non genetically modified food,"" the First Lady said.
After researching exactly where Monsanto's genetically modified corn appeared in her family's diet and becoming concerned about potential negative health effects, Melania Trump said she was ""amazed at the place this company has in the food chain"".
These claims were fictional, however. Although the Monsanto Company does, in fact, produce genetically modified crop seeds, there is no truth to the allegation that Melania Trump has banned  ""Monsanto-tainted products"" from the White House.  (In fact, the First Lady has been the subject of much controversy because she and her son Barron haven't even been living at the White House, but have instead been residing at the Trump Tower in New York.)
These fabricated reports about Melania Trump and Monsanto originated with YourNewsWire, a fake news web site who plagiarized the quotes falsely attributed to the First Lady from a six-year-old Yes! Magazine article by April Davila:

Yes! Magazine (2010):
With the help of sustainable food advocate Cassie Gruenstein, I got in touch with dozens of health food stores and manufacturers to ask where they sourced their products. I spent hours at the farmers' market asking farmers what seed companies they bought from, googling on my iPhone before making purchases. It took several weeks, but I slowly built a somewhat normal Monsanto-free existence.
I began to research where exactly Monsanto corn appeared in my family's diet. With a little online sleuthing, I learned that in addition to producing the genetically modified corn, Monsanto produces several other genetically modified crops such as soy, sugar beets, and cotton. Many of these crops form the foundation of our diets: 70 to 80 percent of American processed foods contain genetically engineered ingredients, according to the Grocery Manufacturers of America.

YourNewsWire (2017):
""I have a friend who is a sustainable food advocate, and I got in touch with dozens of health food stories and manufacturers to ask where they sourced their products,"" the First Lady said. ""I spent a lot of time at farmers' markets asking farmers what seed companies they buy from, googling on my phone before making purchases."" ""It took a few months but I finally managed to get Monsanto out of my life completely.""
After researching exactly where Monsanto's genetically modified corn appeared in her family's diet and becoming concerned about potential negative health effects, Melania Trump said she was ""amazed at the place this company has in the food chain"". The First Lady, who proudly describes herself as a ""full-time mom"", then realized that Monsanto produces other genetically modified crops such as soy, sugar beets, and cotton -- and these products form the foundation of many American's diets. But as Melania explained, this wasn't as easy as it sounds. 70 to 80 percent of American processed foods contain genetically engineered ingredients, according to the Grocery Manufacturers of America.

YourNewsWire is a notorious promulgator of fake news and baseless conspiracy theories. For example, a March 2017 article asserting that former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates confirmed that vaccines are purposely designed to ""depopulate the world,"" which was surely news to Mr. Gates, whose philanthropical work includes improving access to life-saving vaccines for children in the poorest countries in the world.

As the COVID-19 pandemic raged across the globe, a number of rumors and conspiracy theories attempted to blame the disease in some capacity on China and the Chinese Communist Party. Some politicians called the disease the ""Kung Flu,"" a divisive piece of rhetoric that may be partly responsible for a rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans, while internet rumors levied vague accusations at China, stating that they were responsible for a ""COVID cover-up."" 
One rumor held that Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company that developed one of the vaccines against COVID-19, had 70 members of the Chinese Communist Party on its investment board:
 This list made its way around social media, along with various accusations about the vaccine. Some, for example, used this list to cast doubt on vaccine mandates. Others claimed that this was ""proof"" that the COVID-19 pandemic was manmade. The problem with these claims, of course, is that this document does not list 70 members of ""Pfizer's Investment Board"" who are also members of the Chinese Communist Party. 
Pfizer Doesn't Have an 'Investment Board'
First off, it isn't exactly clear what this rumor is referring to as Pfizer's ""investment board."" The company's website has a page for investors, and that page lists several boards and committees - there's an Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Governance & Sustainability Committee, Executive Committee, Regulatory and Compliance Committee, Science and Technology Committee - but no ""investment committee."" It's also worth mentioning that the aforementioned committees are all comprised of a handful of people, not the 100+ implied by the above-displayed meme.
Pfizer Ventures (PV), the venture capital arm of Pfizer Inc., is led by a small team, none of whom are mentioned on this list. 
 






Lastly, this rumor may be referring to Pfizer Investments Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Pfizer that operates out of China. However, a spokesperson for Pfizer told us that ""none of the names listed ... are affiliated with our subsidiary Pfizer Investments Co., Ltd.""
Where Do These Names Come From?
If these names don't come from Pfizer's ""investment board,"" where do they come from?
In December 2020, the Daily Mail and other outlets reported that a ""leaked database of 1.95 million registered (CCP) party members"" revealed that many British, Australian and American companies had employed people tied to the Chinese government. This database, which was originally leaked on Telegram, reportedly dates back to 2016. It doesn't appear that any government agency has verified the authenticity of this database and while this leak may have raised suspicions of corporate espionage -- a genuine threat that the Federal Bureau of Investigations is monitoring -- some news reports about it noted ""there is no evidence that anyone on the party membership list has spied for China.""
Shortly after this ""leak"" made the news, the list purporting to show ""70 members of the Pfizer investment board"" who were also ""members of the Chinese Communist Party"" started circulating on conspiratorial internet forums such as godlikeproductions. At the time, this list was simply being shared as if it showed ""CCP members list (from the) leaked file.
We have not been able to connect the names on this viral list to the leak supposedly showing 1.95 million CCP members (that database is not publicly available), and cannot say if any of the people on this list are truly connected to the CCP. As noted above, this leaked database reportedly comes from 2016 and may not even represent a person's current political affiliations. 
We searched for all 70 names on this viral list, and found that a few of those listed truly worked for Pfizer in some capacity (researchers, programmers, directors, etc...) In many cases, the names weren't properly rendered (the list mentions a ""Cai Bingbing"" that likely refers to a Bing Cai) and in some cases it appears the names were made up out of whole cloth. For example, we were not able to find any matches for ""Chen Thirsty,"" ""High Also,"" ""Jia Four Flowers,"" ""Jody,"" ""Strictly"" or ""Mosha."" One name, too, appeared to refer to a politician, not a Pfizer employee. ""Kevin Rudd"" is a former Prime Minister of Australia, who claimed that he lobbied Pfizer to expedite their vaccine rollout. We also found a few names on this list that referred to former Pfizer employees, not current ones. 
Are There 70 CCP Members on Pfizer's 'Investment Board'?
No.
This list first appeared in December 2020 after an alleged database containing 1.95 million names of members of the Chinese Communist Party was leaked online. While that leaked database reportedly showed the political affiliations of nearly 2 million people as of 2016, it does not show current CCP membership, nor does it provide evidence of corporate espionage. 
The list purporting to show ""70 CCP Members on Pfizer's Investment Board"" shows no such thing. Some of the names on this list relate to people who work for Pfizer, but none of these names were on Pfizer's ""investment board."" Several of the names on this list also appeared to be made up out of whole cloth or referred to politicians unaffiliated with Pfizer.   
While it's possible that members (or former members) of the Chinese Communist Party work for Pfizer, and while China has been accused of corporate espionage in the past, the list purporting to show ""70 CCP Members on Pfizer's Investment Board"" appears to be have been created by searching for Pfizer employees with Chinese-sounding names.

9.Acoalitionofstopthes,"
A coalition of far-right ""stop the steal"" Republicans is working to put Trump loyalists in charge of elections across the U.S. At its helm is a shadowy QAnon influencer who some segments of the conspiracy theory believe to be the late John F. Kennedy Jr.
The America First Secretary of State Coalition includes more than a dozen Republican candidates for secretary of state and other positions with purview over elections, including in battleground states such as Nevada, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Arizona. The candidates say they don't believe that President Joe Biden won the 2020 election. And at least some have demonstrated strong enough support to be competitive in their races to control elections.
Four of the group's candidates are endorsed by former President Donald Trump. They include Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano, who already won his primary. Another, Michigan's Kristina Karamo, also got the nod from her state's Republican Party to be its secretary of state nominee this November. A third, Mark Finchem, has raised about $900,000 in his effort to be Arizona's next secretary of state. 
""We definitely can't write these candidates off as fringe candidates,"" said Joanna Lydgate, CEO of States United Action, which is tracking election deniers running for statewide office. ""There is a real cause for concern right now. People need to pay attention.""
The emergence of the coalition underscores the sticking power of Trump's unfounded allegations that the 2020 election was fraudulent and ""stolen."" It illustrates the growing influence within the Republican Party of a conspiracy movement that helped fuel an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and numerous other incidents of violence and extremism.
It also threatens to transform the often obscure, largely bureaucratic offices that administer elections -- the very agencies that resisted Trump's attempts to reverse his loss in 2020.
PolitiFact reviewed more than 30 hours of video featuring the cowboy boot-wearing QAnon promoter who claims to be organizing the coalition. He appears under the alias of ""Juan O Savin."" We also reviewed interviews and other public statements from the group's candidates.
Their comments reveal a coordinated push to drastically change how Americans vote -- a potential overhaul of voter registration lists, early voting and other mainstays of the democratic process, based in large part on conspiracy theories. The far-reaching changes that the various America First candidates have proposed include eliminating early voting; wiping out existing voter registration lists; pulling states out of a successful information-sharing program that helps them remove ineligible voters from their voter rolls; and getting rid of electronic voting machines.
Mike Rothschild, author of the book ""The Storm Is Upon Us: How QAnon Became a Movement, Cult, and Conspiracy Theory of Everything,"" said the coalition's QAnon connection signifies ""the Q movement is becoming more mainstream, more focused on actually changing the outcomes of elections, and not waiting around for mass arrests anymore."" 
""If this group succeeds in getting potentially insurrectionist secretaries of state installed, it could have terrible consequences for democracy,"" Rothschild said.

A Qanon-themed sign is seen outside of the Maricopa County Recorder's Office in Phoenix on Nov. 5, 2020. (AP)
Juan O Savin's real-life collaboration with secretary of state candidates was the subject of scattered news reports over the last year. The Daily Beast has reported extensively on his background. But in a number of videos posted since the America First coalition took shape in May 2021, Juan O Savin and some of the participating candidates have shared more details about his involvement in what he has referred to as ""our coalition,"" ""our group,"" and a ""project"" that he ""helped put together.""
The coalition is, in Juan O Savin's words, focused on ""looking at how we're going to get to a lawful election this next time around, and get to the right result ... how are we going to coordinate between the various states to get the right outcome?"" 
It's likely a first: A pseudonymous persona with a strange-sounding alias is organizing actual political campaigns across the country to elect candidates that will make real-world changes to American voting laws.  
The origins of the coalition
The day after the 2020 election, Jim Marchant had just settled into a suite across the hall from Trump attorneys and allies at the Venetian Las Vegas hotel. Election results showed he was losing his Nevada congressional campaign to a Democrat, a contest he would soon falsely claim was stolen and challenge unsuccessfully in court. 
""And guess who showed up at my suite? It will blow you away,"" Marchant recounted on Oct. 25, 2021. ""Juan O Savin.""

Jim Marchant speaks about the origins of the America First Secretary of State Coalition during the Patriot Double Down conference in Las Vegas on Oct. 25, 2021, while rehashing false claims about the 2020 election.
In Marchant's retelling -- delivered during the Patriot Double Down conference hosted at a Trump supporter's Las Vegas hotel and organized by another QAnon influencer -- he and Juan O Savin got to work ""trying to expose the fraudulent election."" But Juan O Savin and people who Marchant described as ""other President Trump allies"" also pitched him on a more forward-looking plan. 
Instead of vying for Congress again in 2022, Marchant would run for secretary of state and recruit others to do the same elsewhere. The Nevada seat was one that Marchant and Juan O Savin baselessly claimed had been used to rig state elections under a plot hatched by a ""cabal"" that included billionaire Geoge Soros. (Soros was involved in a project focused on electing Democrats to secretary of state seats between 2006 and 2010, but there's no evidence the initiative led to fraud. Nevada's secretary of state is a Republican.)
""Not only did they ask me to run, they asked me to put together a coalition of other like-minded secretary of state candidates,"" Marchant said during the conference. ""So I got to work, Juan O Savin helped, and we formed a coalition.""
Juan O Savin was so instrumental that Marchant summed up what he called the team's ""plan A"" in two words: ""See Juan.""
Juan O Savin was one of about 50 people who attended or dialed in remotely to the May 1, 2021, inaugural meeting of prospective coalition candidates.
The coalition's website, set up in January, says four of the group's candidates were there: Karamo, Finchem, Rachel Hamm of California, and U.S. Rep. Jody Hice, R-Georgia, who got Trump's endorsement but lost the GOP's primary election to the incumbent secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger. 
Marchant named more pro-Trump figures who were there from the start: MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, a Trump donor who promoted election falsehoods and filed numerous failed lawsuits alleging fraud; Jim and Joe Hoft with the Gateway Pundit, a website that has published false news stories about the election; and Patrick Byrne, the former CEO of the internet retailer Overstock.com, who donated millions to the Cyber Ninjas firm that conducted the Republican-led review of votes in Arizona's Maricopa County.
""I started with Jim Marchant here in Nevada, who has then taken a primary role in this coalition as other candidates have come in, going out around the country and helping vet that we got the right players that are inside the coalition,"" Juan O Savin told QAnon promoter and former boxer David Nino Rodriguez, who calls him ""Juanito,"" in an April interview on Rodriguez's show. 
Juan O Savin told Rodriguez that the secretary of state position is the office with the control to ""cook the vote."" 
""We are working hard to get a leveraged position in the most important place of all,"" Juan O Savin said a month later.
The coalition has grown to include 15 website-listed candidates, although Juan O Savin has claimed in multiple interviews that the number is up to 19 or 20. In June, he estimated that they had about ""24 states represented."" The group also set up a PAC, which raised about $98,000 as of April.
The group infrastructure helps the candidates share ""best practices"" and sound ""early alarms"" over what they perceive to be voter irregularities in their states, said Allen Whitt, a spokesperson for Tina Peters, the coalition's recently indicted candidate running in Colorado. They hold weekly meetings with each other. They have hosted a dozen events around the country centered around sowing doubts about the 2020 election. And they hope the coalition provides a model for 2024.
Juan O Savin has recounted in various videos how he helped arrange events for the candidates, spoke with Marchant ""about what kind of office would make sense"" and then ""privately numerous times,"" spent a weekend with Hamm and her husband, and had dinner with Peters and her campaign manager.

This video is a compilation of clips in which Juan O Savin talks about the America First Secretary of State Coalition. It is drawn from video found on Twitter, Rumble, YouTube and 107 Daily website.
South Carolina Secretary of State candidate Keith Blandford told Juan O Savin during a May interview that his leadership was pivotal. ""Everybody was really frightened after Nov. 3,"" said Blandford. ""You were the one that provided us some light in this tunnel.""
""I am so proud to be in the foxhole with you,"" Blandford said.
How Juan O Savin became the coalition's 'plan A'
Before he became Marchant's ""plan A,"" Juan O Savin built a brand within the QAnon conspiracy movement. QAnon grew out of an anonymous internet persona's posts on far-right message boards starting in 2017 and coalesced around beliefs that a cabal of elite Satanic pedophiles is running a global sex trafficking ring that Trump was tapped by the military to defeat.
The moniker, ""Juan O Savin,"" is a phonetic play on the number 107. It may be a nod to the seventeenth letter in the alphabet, Q, or to gematria, a form of numerology often cited by QAnon adherents. ""When you see 107, drop the zero,"" Juan O Savin said in April.
Factions of the movement believe Juan O Savin is actually the late John F. Kennedy Jr., who died in a plane crash in 1999, while others believe that Juan O Savin is a grifter and that the Kennedy myth makes the movement look bad, according to researchers who follow QAnon. 
The delusion that Kennedy faked his own death has hardened into gospel in some QAnon circles. It's become so popular that multiple influencers have been rumored to be Kennedy in disguise, and a group unrelated to Juan O Savin camped out in Dallas to await his return to life -- even after ""Q,"" the anonymous poster behind the movement, explicitly said Kennedy is not alive. 
But Juan O Savin's appeal also hinges on the mystique he's created as a QAnon insider. He revealed himself at the Patriot Double Down conference in October, rolling up in a red Aston Martin and entering the conference to cheers as Phil Collins' ""In the Air Tonight"" played in the room. Until then, Juan O Savin took care to conceal his identity. 
He typically records interviews without showing his face, with the camera instead aimed out the window, at his boots or at the steering wheel while he drives. On at least one occasion, however, he accidentally showed his face, giving online sleuths a window to dig up more information about him.
Those sleuths, along with reporters from Vice and the Daily Beast, have reported that Juan O Savin's real name is Wayne Willott, a private investigator from Washington state who court documents show was involved with insurance investigations in Alaska as of 2009.
A blurb beside Juan O Savin's book on the website EBooksStore says the book is a ""transcript of speeches by Wayne Willott, using his nom de plume Juan O Savin.""
A 2015 lawsuit filed against radio host Douglas Hagmann and other people in Hagmann's orbit made repeated references to a Wayne Willott, revealing that Willott had frequently appeared on Hagmann's show in the years before QAnon under another alias, ""W the Intelligence Insider."" W the Intelligence Insider's voice in those radio segments sounds similar to Juan O Savin's, and the Daily Beast reported that Hagmann also interviewed Willott under the ""Juan O Savin"" alias. 
PolitiFact found other indicators connecting the two personas, as well.
According to Rothschild, the QAnon expert, Juan O Savin's entry into QAnon influencer status started with his minor involvement with a group called ""E-Clause,"" which sprung out of outlandish claims that state Child Protective Services agencies were stealing children and forcing them into slavery. Around 2019, Juan O Savin began appearing on an online show that promoted such claims, and he played a small role in the case of a QAnon follower who planned to raid her child's foster home and then fled law enforcement. 
Juan O Savin's celebrity within the QAnon community has grown since. 
At the Patriot Double Down conference in October, he appeared on stage with ""The Passion of the Christ"" actor Jim Caviezel. He has recorded conversations with comedian Roseanne Barr, one of the earliest celebrities to embrace QAnon, and anti-vaccine advocate Sherri Tenpenny, a top spreader of COVID-19 misinformation. He also claims to have spent time with an unnamed senator, an unnamed Supreme Court justice, and the son of a legendary boxer.
In his conversations with Rodriguez and other QAnon personalities, Juan O Savin references the Bible, riffs about near-death experiences, asserts baseless claims of a stolen election and prophesizes about the takedown of the pedophilic cabal that was promised under QAnon's mythology.
According to Juan O Savin's recorded statements, he believes that the military views the 2020 election as stolen and is still recognizing Trump as the commander in chief. COVID-19 is a myth, the pandemic was planned, and the vaccines contain snake venom. Mark Zuckerberg is a ""deep state"" figurehead, not the inventor of Facebook. Globalists are working to depopulate the nation as part of a plot inscribed on a set of stones in the state of Georgia. The Statue of Liberty and the Washington Monument are secret tributes to the Egyptian god of the underworld. And Trump was sending coded messages as president via semaphore, a method of visual signaling that was used before the invention of the telegraph, by embedding them in the patterns of former first lady Melania Trump's dresses.
Some of Juan O Savin's ideas appear to have been taken up by some of the America First candidates -- and especially by Hamm, a YouTube host and author before she entered politics.
Hamm says she was inspired to run for office after Jesus Christ appeared before her son at her home; she's also claimed that California really went for Trump in a ""landslide"" in 2020, echoing Juan O Savin's false belief that the deeply blue state is actually conservative but overridden by fraud.
After Juan O Savin told the crowd at Patriot Double Down in October that ""a court in Gitmo"" could be used for those who upheld the 2020 election outcome, Hamm two days later echoed his words.
""Remember, Juan told us the other night that if we can't get justice through our courts, he has built another one,"" Hamm said, speaking on a Patriot Double Down panel with Marchant, Karamo and Finchem. ""Remember? He said that the other night. We built one in Gitmo, he said.""
Who are the candidates?
Once an out-of-the-way job that kept the democratic process moving, the secretary of state position took on a heightened importance in 2020, when Raffensperger and others faced pressure from Trump to overturn their states' results on his behalf.
Now, the America First coalition's effort to replace those seats with candidates who refuse to accept the reality of the 2020 election has democracy scholars and QAnon watchers who have followed Juan O Savin worried that they could thwart the will of the voters in 2024 and beyond. Several of the candidates have themselves invoked QAnon rhetoric in recent years.
In the battleground states, the candidates are:


Marchant, who has said he's running to ""overhaul the fraudulent election system"" and would not have certified the 2020 election for Biden. 


Trump-endorsed Karamo, who earned name recognition after claiming to have witnessed irregularities in the absentee ballot count in Detroit. 


Mastriano, a retired Army colonel and Pennsylvania state senator who sought to halt the certification of the 2020 election and arranged buses to transport Trump supporters to Washington on Jan. 6, 2021. As governor, Mastriano would have the power to appoint a secretary of state, and his platform calls for eliminating no-excuse mail voting and ballot drop boxes.


Finchem, an Arizona state representative who also secured a Trump endorsement after authoring unsuccessful bills that furthered the former president's myths about voter fraud, including a resolution to decertify the election to get rid of early voting. Finchem was outside the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and has identified himself as a member of the far-right Oath Keepers militia group. 


Candidates running in non-battleground states include Hamm in California; Peters in Colorado; Blandford in South Carolina; Audrey Trujillo in New Mexico; Diego Morales in Indiana; Mike Brown in Kansas; Jim Ziegler in Alabama; and Dante Sabatucci, who is running for Congress in Ohio. The coalition also featured Hice, Dorothy Moon in Idaho and Robert Borer in Nebraska, each of whom has already lost their state's primary. (Hice denied affiliation with the coalition in a statement to Vice.) 

The group previously included David Winney, who stepped aside in Colorado when Peters jumped in the race and who consulted with Joan O Savin regarding the decision to drop out. Juan O Savin has also repeatedly mentioned Nevada gubernatorial candidate Joey Gilbert, attorney general Sigal Chattah and U.S. Senate candidate Sam Brown as candidates he is involved with.
""What we are seeing right now is this coordinated effort to undermine the integrity of the system, to run candidates who are election deniers,"" said Lydgate, the CEO of States United Action. ""This is not business as usual.""

113.AnursewhofaintedafterreceivingtheCOVID19vaccinediedfromthevaccination,"
It's been 10 months since Tiffany Dover, a nurse manager at Catholic Health Initiatives Memorial Hospital in Chattanooga, Tenn., received her first Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine dose. She fainted shortly after she got the shot and was in the middle of a television interview when it happened.
After recovering a few minutes later, Dover told local news outlets that she felt a little disoriented when it happened but was fine immediately afterward. She has an overactive vagal response, Dover explained, which causes her to pass out from even the slightest pain.
Still, clips of her fainting spread far and wide online accompanied by claims that it was proof that the vaccine wasn't safe. Then, a more insidious rumor started to gain steam: that Dover actually died from the shot, and everyone was covering it up. 
Now, despite countless fact-checks, statements from hospital officials and comments from her family, there are still scores of internet users who continue to push the conspiracy theory.
""Do you remember the nurse in TN who passed out live on camera?"" a woman says in an Oct. 17 Instagram video. ""Well nobody covered what happened to her next. So watch this next video and find out what happened to her next. This is insane what they're trying to cover.""
The next clip shows a man repeating the details about Dover's fainting episode before saying, ""And, well, what they didn't tell you, is that she died that day, on the 17th of December. She is dead. They covered it up. They paid the family off.""
There is no evidence that this is true. The hospital has repeatedly responded to these rumors and confirmed to PolitiFact again on Oct. 20 that Dover is alive and is still an employee there. 
In the months since the false claim first surfaced, journalists have documented intense and bizarre harassment toward Dover, her family, and the hospital, insisting she died when she didn't. 
The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Regarding the claim that Dover ""died that day,"" there is video evidence that Dover recovered from the Dec. 17 incident.
""I have a history of having an overactive vagal response, and so with that if I have pain from anything, hangnail or if I stub my toe, I can just pass out,"" Dover told WRCBtv a few minutes after she fainted. 
She added: ""It just, you know, hit me all of a sudden, just felt very diaphoretic. I can feel it coming on so I felt a little disoriented. But I feel fine now and the pain in my arm is very minimal actually, but it doesn't take much. I have passed out probably six times in the past six weeks. It's common for me.""

The Pentagon ""finally comes clean"" and ""admits...that there are 46 U.S. military-funded biolabs in Ukraine""

Catholic Health Initiatives Memorial Hospital has since confirmed, several times, that Dover is alive and well. The Tennessee Department of Health still lists Dover as a licensed registered nurse.
""Nurse Tiffany Dover appreciates the concern shown for her. She is home and doing well. She asks for privacy for her and her family,"" the hospital said on Twitter on Dec. 19, according to a fact-check by USA Today. 
On Dec. 21, multiple news organizations reported that the hospital also shared a video of Dover and her colleagues to prove she was alive, with some holding signs that read ""Nursing Leadership Supports Tiffany"" and ""#CHIMemorialStrong."" Another hospital official told the Associated Press that Dover was feeling well and was working a shift that day.
Around the same time, another spokesperson for the hospital said that the organization was ""aware of the multitude of false information circulating on social media about Tiffany Dover,"" and made the video to ""clear up many of the circulating rumors,"" the Daily Beast reported in February.
It didn't matter. Commenters continue to flood her social media accounts to this day with messages like ""RIP angel"" and ""where is Tiffany!!"" because she hasn't posted recent videos.
We were unable to reach Dover, and the hospital has deleted its references to Dover on its social media accounts. But this is hardly evidence that Dover is not alive, given the level of the backlash she and the hospital have been subjected to by those who believe that the facility is somehow covering up her death. 
At one point, Dover's brother-in-law shared an article debunking claims that she was dead and hundreds of people left angry comments like, ""How much money do they pay you all that you post this? She is dead and you know,"" according to reporting by the Daily Beast. Under a similar post by her sister-in-law, which attracted nearly 900 comments, someone wrote, ""Your entire family is disgusting that you don't let Tiffany speak herself!""
Regarding further ""proof"" presented in these claims, some pointed to screenshots of what they  said was Dover's death report on SearchQuarry.com and Ancestry.com, neither of which contain official public records or show official death certificates. 
When PolitiFact tried to search on SearchQuarry.com, an unreliable public database where the information can only be accessed after purchase, the website repeatedly timed out. An Ancestry.com spokesperson previously confirmed to Reuters that details entered for an individual ""don't need to be backed up or supported by official sources"" and are not verified by the genealogy company.
Our ruling
An Instagram post claims that Tiffany Dover, a Tennessee nurse who was seen fainting after receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in December 2020, is dead.
There has been no evidence that Dover died and Catholic Health Initiatives Memorial Hospital confirmed to PolitiFact that she is alive and is still an employee. We also found no legitimate record of her death and her nursing license remains active.
Several news and fact-checking organizations have repeatedly debunked rumors about her death, citing multiple statements from the hospital and a video that showed Dover alive and well. But conspiracy theorists continue to hound the facility and Dover's family, insisting she died when she didn't.

24.PhotosoftheallegedBuffaloshootinggunmanshowtwodifferentpeople,"
Authorities have identified 18-year-old Payton Gendron as the suspect in a May 14 massacre at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, that left 10 people dead and others injured. 
Unfounded false flag claims often follow mass shootings in the United States, and this one is no different. 
Among them is a conspiracy theory that suggests images taken of Gendron after the shooting show not one but two crisis actors. 
""Went from ginger haired 'fit' person to a black haired heavy dude,"" one May 14 post says. ""In less than one hour."" 
The post shows two photos. One is of Gendron in a white paper gown and white face mask as he was being arraigned in Buffalo City Court on May 14. The other shows him wearing green camo-print clothes outside the grocery store in police custody earlier that day. His hair in that photo appears more auburn than in the photo of the court hearing.

59.IsThatCPACNationalAn,"
In February 2021, as conservatives gathered in Orlando, Florida, for the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), a video went viral on social media that supposedly showed how the conference began with a messy rendition of the national anthem. 
The viral CPAC national anthem video features a split screen. On one side, there's a singer. And on the other, we see a pianist rush to his seat and hurriedly prepare himself to play as a voice off camera can be heard saying ""don't screw this up."" 





The video on the right features a genuine video from CPAC. The video on the left does not. 
This rendition of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" was performed by singer Sailor Sabol. While some on social media claimed that this singer is also Ted Cruz's dog walker (a reference to a misleading claim about the Texas senator ""abandoning"" his dog when he traveled to Cancun, Mexico, during a severe winter storm), that is not the case. Others claimed that this performance took place just before former U.S. President Donald Trump took the stage. That is also untrue.  






According to CPAC's schedule, this rendition of the national anthem took place on the first day of CPAC 2021. Trump spoke on the final day of the conference. An unaltered version of Sabol's performance can be seen at the 20 minute mark of the following video:



As you can see, this was an a capella version (sans piano accompaniment) of the national anthem. 
Sabol's interpretation of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" struck a sour chord with some social media users, who shared video of her rendition with various jokes and criticism.
One person, for instance, claimed that this song was in the ""key of Q"" (a reference to the Qanon conspiracy theory.) As the criticism circulated, some musicians started posting videos of themselves playing along with Sabol. The viral video shared above comes from pianist Larry Goldings.
Here's a similar parody video from Kevon Carter:





In short, a rendition of the national anthem performed at CPAC 2021 inspired some musicians to post mocking parodies. The singer's performance was real; the accompaniments were not.

80.NoFourBritishAirways,"
In June 2021, unscrupulous conspiracy theorists seized upon a series of tragic deaths among British Airways pilots, cynically and falsely claiming that all four died as a direct consequence of having received a COVID-19 vaccination. 
The basis for that false claim was no more than a short voicemail message from an unnamed man, which was shared online in mid-June. The anonymous speaker claimed that ""[his] friend who's a BA [British Airways] pilot"" had told him three pilots had died in seven days as a result of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. The man went on to claim that the airline was ""in crisis talks"" with the U.K. government over the safety of continuing to allow vaccinated pilots to fly.
That audio clip formed the basis of social media posts, and others shared a photograph of four books of condolences, falsely claiming they represented ""[four] dead BA pilots killed by the Covid vaccines.""
The photograph of the books of condolences appears to be authentic, but the claim that the four pilots were somehow killed by receiving a COVID-19 vaccination was false.
The airline itself firmly rejected that claim, writing on Twitter:
Sadly four members of our pilot community passed away recently. Our thoughts are with their family and friends. However, there is no truth whatsoever in the claims on social media speculating that the four deaths are linked. 







Snopes has been able to verify the identities of three British Airways pilots who died in May and June 2021: Capt. Nicholas Synnott; Senior First Officer Edward Brice-Bennett; and Senior First Officer Grant Mercer. A fourth name was also included in social media posts related to the conspiracy theory, but we were unable to verify any details about the death of that person during the summer of 2021.
Synnott died in June 2021, and his passing was noted in a June 10 article by the Daily Mail, as well as a memorial page created by his loved ones. The claim that he was killed by a COVID-19 vaccination is especially outrageous, given that he contracted the virus in March 2020, while working in Texas.
He was profoundly ill with COVID-19, and experienced respiratory failure, with one doctor saying, ""Every organ in his body was affected."" After receiving care for eight months at UT Health and Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston, Synnott finally returned home to England in December 2020. 
Brice-Bennett died on June 2, 2021. The New Valley News, a local newspaper based in South Wiltshire and North Dorset in England, reported that he had been found unconscious in a mountain biking park in Tidworth, Wiltshire, and was later pronounced dead by paramedics. A coroner's inquest was told that a postmortem examination had found Brice-Bennett had suffered from ""abdominal trauma and haemoperitoneum,"" which is a kind of internal abdominal bleeding. 
Mercer died on May 4, 2021. His loved ones have set up a memorial page to help defray funeral costs. A person with direct knowledge of the circumstances surrounding Mercer's death told Snopes unequivocally that it had no connection whatsoever with COVID-19 vaccination.
Many adults in the U.K. have been partially or fully vaccinated against COVID-19, as of the summer of 2021. Therefore, a reasonable likelihood exists that some or all of the British Airways pilots who died in May and June 2021 had been vaccinated.
As it happens, though, we found no specific evidence that that was the case, and no one claiming the pilots were ""killed by the COVID vaccines"" has presented any such evidence, except for the anonymous, second- or third-hand account contained in the voicemail message promulgated online in June 2021. Neither has anyone presented any scientific explanation as to how, precisely, COVID-19 vaccination supposedly killed the pilots. 
As we have shown, we know that in at least three cases, clear alternative explanations existed for the deaths, and British Airways has unequivocally stated that the four deaths were not linked, a clarification the airline provided in the knowledge that, if it was inaccurate, it could be readily contradicted by friends and loved ones of the pilots, to the significant public shame and embarrassment of the company. Taking all these factors into account, the claim that four British Airways pilots were killed by COVID-19 vaccination, in May and June 2021, is false.

120.TrumpRepeatsBaseless,"



In his first interview since Election Day, President Donald Trump recapped baseless, false and misleading claims he has made before of a ""rigged"" election.
Trump spoke by phone with Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on Nov. 29. In the interview, Trump went so far as to suggest the Department of Justice might be part of some grand conspiracy. ""This is total fraud. And how the FBI and Department of Justice -- I don't know. Maybe they're involved,"" Trump said.
There's no evidence that Trump's loss of a second term is due to ""fraud."" State and federal judges have rejected Trump's claims, saying the Trump legal team has provided no evidence of fraud, and election security officials have labeled this ""the most secure in American history.""
Update, Dec. 1: Attorney General William Barr told the Associated Press on Dec. 1 that U.S. attorneys and the FBI have followed up on claims of fraud. ""To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election,"" Barr said. 
Bogus Attacks on Dominion Voting Systems
The president stuck to a conspiracy theory that Dominion Voting Systems had switched ""thousands of votes"" from him to President-elect Joe Biden, saying these were cases of ""theft"" not ""glitches."" A group of federal, state and local officials overseeing the nation's voting system refuted such claims back on Nov. 12, hours after Trump tweeted them.
""There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised,"" said the Elections Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council and the Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Executive Committees. The joint statement from the groups described the 2020 election as ""the most secure in American history.""
That statement was distributed by Trump's own government: the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security. Five days after that statement, Trump fired the head of CISA, Christopher Krebs.
In a Nov. 29 interview on CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" Krebs, a Republican, reiterated that claims about election software or systems being hacked are ""nonsense."" He said that the use of paper ballots, which increased in 2020 compared with 2016, gives officials the ability to ""check the tape.""
""That gives you the ability to prove that there was no malicious algorithm or hacked software that adjusted the tally of the vote, and just look at what happened in Georgia,"" Krebs said. ""Georgia has machines that tabulate the vote. They then held a hand recount and the outcome was consistent with the machine vote.""
When Trump tweeted about ""deleted"" or ""switched"" votes on Nov. 12, we found his claims could be traced back to an anonymous post on a pro-Trump message board.
Kay Stimson, Dominion Voting Systems' vice president for governmental affairs, told us in an email then that its technology, certified by 28 states, didn't cause any vote switching. ""Dominion Voting Systems categorically denies any claims about any vote switching or alleged software issues with our voting systems,"" Stimson said. ""Our systems continue to reliably and accurately count ballots, and state and local election authorities have publicly confirmed the integrity of the process.""
Dominion Voting Systems, which is based in Denver, has a webpage dedicated to rebutting bogus rumors about its equipment and technology. It reiterates that claims about deleting or switching votes are ""completely false.""
But Trump repeated them to Bartiromo anyway:
Trump: You start with these machines that have been suspect, not allowed to be used in Texas, the Dominion machines, where tremendous reports have been put out.
We have affidavits on -- from many people talking about what went on with machines. They had glitches. ...
Well, no, we had glitches where they moved thousands of votes from my account to Biden's account. And these are glitches. So, they're not glitches. They're theft. They're fraud, absolute fraud. And there were many of them, but, obviously, most of them tremendous amounts, got by without us catching. ...
I think we caught four or five glitches of about 5,000 votes each, and different states. And, again, they're not glitches. That was fraud. And they got caught.
There were no such glitches. ""No credible reports or evidence of any software issues exist,"" Dominion Voting Systems says.
The election results ""are 100% auditable,"" the company says.
There were a few cases of human errors that were quickly corrected. We wrote about one case in Shiawassee County, Michigan, in which a typo led to a brief, large uptick in votes for Biden. It was quickly caught and corrected.
The New York Times investigated five cases -- not all of them in counties using Dominion software -- and found that they were all promptly detected and corrected. ""In all of the cases, software did not affect the vote counts,"" the Times reported.
Update, Dec. 1: Attorney General Barr told the Associated Press: ""There's been one assertion that would be systemic fraud and that would be the claim that machines were programmed essentially to skew the election results. And the DHS and DOJ have looked into that, and so far, we haven't seen anything to substantiate that.""
As for Texas, the state has declined to certify Dominion systems. Dominion says: ""While we disagree with Texas' decision to not certify our systems, we understand there are different standards in different states. Sometimes it takes adjustments, for any company's systems, to meet a certain state's standard.""
In the Fox News interview, Trump also falsely claimed, ""You know, the votes in Dominion, they say, are counted in foreign countries, OK?"" Whoever says this is wrong.
""Vote counts are conducted by county and state election officials, not by Dominion,"" the company says.
On ""60 Minutes,"" Krebs was asked specifically about this false claim by Trump and others. ""So all votes in the United States of America are counted in the United States of America,"" he said. ""I don`t- I don`t understand this claim. All votes in the United States of America are counted in the United States of America. Period.""
False Claim of Winning Before Votes Were Counted
Trump also repeated his false claim to have ""won"" on Election Night, despite the fact that several states hadn't counted enough ballots at that point to project a winner.
Trump: And what happened, if you watched the election, I was called by the biggest people, saying, congratulations, political people. Congratulations, sir. You just won the election. It was 10:00. And you looked at the numbers. And I'm sure you felt that way.
This election was over. And then they did dumps. They call them dumps, big, massive dumps, in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and all over. ...
And they did these massive dumps of votes. And, all of a sudden, I went from winning by a lot to losing by a little. And, in some cases, it took a period of time to do it. North Carolina, they couldn't do it. I won North Carolina. They couldn't -- somehow, they had a better system. But they couldn't do anything. I believe they tried.
As we've written before, it was no surprise that Trump's lead in some states dwindled, or was erased, as more votes were counted because those states counted in-person votes first and mail-in votes later. Democrats were more likely to vote by mail.
State laws in Pennsylvania and Michigan prohibited election officials from counting mail-in ballots until Election Day. Pennsylvania could not even begin pre-canvassing -- opening envelopes and preparing the ballots to be counted -- until 7 a.m. on Election Day, Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar said at a virtual seminar held Oct. 20 by the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard University. 
At the time, she said that the majority of ballots wouldn't be counted until Friday, Nov. 6. In fact, the state hadn't counted enough ballots for media outlets to project Biden the winner until Nov. 7. 
Dead People Voting
The president repeated the unsubstantiated claim that ""thousands"" of dead people voted in the election. 
""Dead people were seeing ballots,"" Trump said, speaking of mail-in ballots. ""But, even worse, dead people were applying to get a ballot. They were making application to get ballots, many. And, you know, we're not talking about 10 people. We're talking -- there are a lot of dead people that so-called voted in this election.""
""But dead people were, in some cases, in many, many cases, thousands of cases, voted, but, also, dead people made application to vote,"" he continued. ""They were dead 10 years, 15 years, and they actually made application.""
As we've written, allegations of dead people voting cropped up shortly after the election, particularly in Pennsylvania, which Biden won by more than 80,000 votes. But there is no evidence of such voting fraud on any large scale.
Election experts previously told us that while on occasion these types of fraudulent incidents occur, they are rare -- and frequently, alleged cases of dead people voting can be explained by list-matching or administrative errors, such as confusing two people with identical or similar names.
One purported dead voter in Michigan, for example, was a case of mistaken identity. In a lawsuit filed by the Trump campaign, which has since been voluntarily withdrawn, a mother claimed that she saw records stating that her deceased son had voted after he died. Voting records in the state, however, show that her son did not vote after he died and his registration had been appropriately canceled. The state suspects that the mother saw records for another person with her son's name.
In Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, a registered Republican attempted to apply for a mail-in ballot under his deceased mother's name in October -- but was caught, and charged with felonies.
Poll Watchers and 'Unexpected' Ballots
Trump once again falsely said that Republicans weren't allowed to have poll watchers and incorrectly claimed to have pictures and evidence ""of new ballots being brought into counting rooms."" That could be a reference to a viral video of a man unloading camera equipment -- not ballots.
Trump: You know, the poll watchers -- and this is true with all of the states, just about, that you're talking about, I think all of them. They weren't allowed to have poll watchers. The Democrats and thugs, thugs -- I'm not talking about saying, could you please move over? They threw them out of the counting rooms. They weren't allowed to be in. They threw them outside in many cases. 
You heard the story where the people, they went out and sent for binoculars, because they wouldn't allow them to watch. And during that period of time, a lot of bad things happened. Then they closed -- as you know, they closed up the voting, and then for -- unexpectedly. They closed up all of the counting.
Unexpectedly, new ballots came in. And it was all new numbers being added. We have pictures and we have evidence of new ballots being brought into counting rooms. 
Trump and his campaign have frequently pointed to issues related to election observer access in lawsuits, but it's not true that Republicans were not permitted to have observers.
In Pennsylvania, for example, the dispute was about how close the observers could get to poll workers, as we've written. And in another case, a Trump lawyer even admitted during a hearing that the campaign did have some canvassing observers present when he said, ""There's a nonzero number of people in the room.""
The Trump campaign also alleged that it did not have ""meaningful opportunity"" to observe ballot counting in Detroit, but later withdrew its suit. There is no evidence that at any time there weren't Republican observers present.
The president's other comments also appear to refer to Detroit's TCF Center, which on the afternoon of Nov. 4 temporarily barred some election observers of both parties from entering because of capacity limits.
The unexpected arrival of ""new ballots being brought into counting rooms"" could be a reference to an already debunked viral video from a conservative website showing a man unloading a black box from a white van and putting it into a wagon that was wheeled into the counting center. 
The implication is that the box contained ballots, but as we've explained before, it was camera equipment. Ross Jones, an investigative reporter for WXYZ-TV, Detroit's ABC affiliate, said on Twitter: ""The 'ballot thief' was my photographer. He was bringing down equipment for our 12-hour shift.""
Flawed Logic on 'Just Biden on Top'
Trump claimed that ""a lot of ballots"" included votes only for Biden and no other down-ballot candidates, citing this as evidence of fraud. But Trump's logic is flawed.
Trump: As you know, there were a lot of ballots where it was just Biden on top. They didn't do anything else, because they were in a rush. And from what everybody is saying, and from what -- I don't think we even have to prove this. They say that I was doing so much better than they thought that they panicked, and they started just doing ballot after ballot very quickly and just checking the Biden name on top. They didn't have time.
So, you have all these ballots with just one name checked. People don't vote that way.
It is true that Biden won more votes than Democrats running in other races. For example, Biden received about 100,000 more votes in Georgia than Democratic Senate candidate Jon Ossoff. But that doesn't mean -- as Trump campaign adviser Steve Cortes has claimed -- that those ballots contained votes only for Biden and no other down-ballot candidate.
When asked to comment on similar claims about ""Biden-only"" voting in Georgia, Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told us it is not possible to know how many Georgians voted for Biden and no other candidate. That ""would require individual-level information from ballots, not aggregation information about ballots cast in each race,"" he said. 
Instead, Biden's better performance than Ossoff in Georgia is likely because of ticket-splitting, when a voter picks a presidential candidate of one party and a Senate candidate of another party, and ""ballot roll-off,"" which is when voters skip certain races.
Burden told us it's not unusual for voters to ""choose a candidate at the top of the ballot and then 'roll off' as they move down the ballot. There is nothing suspicious about lower participation in lower level races.""
Trump Ballots Weren't 'Thrown Out'
The president claimed that ""many ballots with the name Trump on were thrown out."" But there is no evidence that any ballots legally cast for Trump were not counted.
""Many ballots with the name Trump on were thrown out. You have read that,"" Trump said. ""They found ballots in a river with the name Trump on from the military. They were signed. And they were floating in a river. They found ballots under rocks that had the name Trump on. They were signed. They were signed with Trump.""
Trump had been making this claim even before the Nov. 3 election. But there is only one instance of Trump votes -- seven of them -- accidentally being tossed out. It happened in September, when the Justice Department announced that nine military ballots -- seven cast for Trump -- were found in a trash can in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.
A state election official said the ballots were discarded in error, according to the Times Leader of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. In the end, all nine votes were counted, the paper reported.
Republicans Win with Mail-In Ballots
Trump made the baseless and contradictory claim that Republicans cannot win with mail-in voting. ""And, by the way,"" he said, ""if Republicans allow it to happen, you'll never have another Republican elected in the history of this country at a Senate level or at a presidential level. You'll never -- or at a House level.""
In fact, Republicans fared surprisingly well in the Senate and House races, despite the record number of mail-in ballots and Biden's strong performance at the top of the ticket.
The Republicans, so far, won 11 House races and lost just three for a net gain of eight, according to CNN.
In the Senate, the Republicans had nearly twice as many seats to defend (23) than the Democrats (12), but so far have had a net loss of only one seat. The Republicans may be able to keep control of the Senate, if they win at least one of the two Senate runoff races in Georgia.

39.WasMailBombingSuspec,"
On 26 October 2018, federal authorities arrested a man named Cesar Sayoc in connection with a series of mail bombs that were sent to various Democratic politicians, news organizations, and liberal fundraisers. The intended targets, as well as political stickers on the suspect's van, photographs showing him at rallies for President Trump, social media posts calling for a ""Red Wave,"" and an official Florida voter registration record listing Sayoc as a Republican, indicated that the suspect harbored a definite political affiliation.
As the evidence mounted that Cesar Sayoc was a supporter of President Trump and that he targeted some of the president's biggest foes, some commenters on social media claimed that the media was lying about Sayoc's political affiliations and that the suspected mail bomber was actually a registered Democrat. A screenshot from the web site MyLife.com which listed ""Democrat"" for Sayoc's political party soon started circulating on social media to back up this theory:

This screenshot is real, but it is not evidence that Sayoc was ever registered as a Democrat.
The information on MyLife.com is ""gathered from a variety of pubic records,"" but information on the site can also be edited by users. We couldn't find an archived version of Sayoc's MyLife.com page prior to his arrest, but after his name was released to the public in connection with the mail bombings, his page underwent a series of changes as partisans and internet trolls edited the page to their liking. 






In the hours after Sayoc's arrest, a series of edits were made to his MyLife page, many of which reflected various alt-right conspiracy theories. For example, Sayoc was listed as a ""lunatic leftist,"" a DNC FALSE FLAG PATSY, a Scientologist, a Green Card Whisperer, a paid actor, and a ""Soros Dick Massager."" (It should be noted that Billionaire George Soros, who is frequently invoked by right-wing conspiracy theorists, was also sent a bomb during the wave of mailings.) The suspect's MyLife page also stated that he attended Parkland High School (scene of a previous mass shooting), that he was Jewish, a Scientologist, a Republican, a Democrat, a bootlicker, a classic deplorable, and a terrorist:

In other words, Sayoc's MyLife.com page is not ""documentation"" that he was ever registered a Democrat.
Actual documentation shows that Sayoc was registered as a Republican at the time of his arrest. According to Florida's voter registration rolls, Sayoc  registered as a Republican on 4 March 2016. His party affiliation prior to this date is unknown:

The claim that Cesar Sayoc was registered as a Democrat is not based on reliable information. This claim stems from an unofficial record that was briefly posted to an unreliable web site and underwent a series of politically motivated edits in the wake of Sayoc's arrest. Official records show that Sayoc was registered as a Republican in March 2016.
Voter registrations don't always match up with one's current political viewpoint. One could, for instance, be swayed during the course of an election and end up voting for a candidate outside of their listed affiliation. In Sayoc's case, however, he was an active supporter of President Trump and frequently posted on social media about voting for Republicans:

327.SaysCOVID19testingcouldbedonewithmouthswabssomaybedeeperswabbingisimplantingsomething,"
Could coronavirus testers be doing more than just testing with their nasal swabs?
An ominous Facebook post suggests that instead of just retrieving a sample with a swab to test for the presence of COVID-19, testers are ""implanting something.""
The post, shared 320,000 times, argues it this way:
""1) Modern Science can take a swab from the inside of your cheek and do a COMPLETE DNA MAPPING. 2) If this COVID-19 is so CONTAGIOUS that tiny microscopic particles of Saliva in your MOUTH could spread out in excess of 6 feet and you need to wear a mask to stop the Spread. WHY not Swab the inside of your HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS MOUTH ? 3) When you tilt your head back are you sure that is just a Q-Tip going 6 inches up your nose ? - Is it possible that instead of retreiving a SAMPLE, they could actually be IMPLANTING SOMETHING ? ? ? Again DNA can be done at home through the mail with simple MOUTH SWAB but the HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS COVID-19 in your MASK COVERED MOUTHS can't be tested with a Mouth Swab ? ?""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Tests that extract samples from where the nasal cavity connects with the throat are considered the most accurate, and there is no evidence of testers implanting anything.
How the test works
Here's how the test is described by Dr. Micah Bhatti, an infectious-diseases professor at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston:
""The person conducting the test will insert a long stick with a very soft brush on the end -- kind of like a pipe cleaner -- up your nose and twirl it around for a few seconds. The soft bristles will collect a sample of secretions there for analysis. The swab has to go pretty far back, because cells and fluids must be collected from along the entire passageway that connects the base of the nose to the back of the throat to get a really good specimen.

According to International Olympic Committee data, ""an average of 29 athletes under the age of 35 suffered sudden death per year from 1966 to 2004. From March 2021 to March 2022, 769 athletes have died or suffered cardiac arrest.""












By Samantha Putterman * June 23, 2022







""Tests can be performed on other specimen types that are less invasive, such as a throat swab. But they are less sensitive than the COVID-19 nasal swab test. Saliva is another specimen type that is being explored, but the jury is still out on that one.""
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends upper respiratory system tests. And the Mayo Clinic says: ""Though not considered the best way to get a good sample, a saliva test may be done if discomfort is an issue with a nose or throat swab.""
Debunked testing conspiracies
Similar conspiracy theories have emerged about the tests and have been debunked:
We rated as Pants on Fire a claim that ""the spot where they are 'getting a sample' for the COVID-19 test is called your Blood-Brain Barrier."" The swabs do not go anywhere near the blood-brain barrier, the name given to the unique protective properties found in blood vessels that supply blood to the central nervous system. And there is no evidence that getting a COVID-19 test could cause anything more serious than temporary irritation.
We rated as False a claim that Bill Gates and George Soros want to ""secretly stick you with a chip while testing you for the coronavirus."" There was no evidence to back the claim.
A number of fact-checks, including by USA Today and AFP Fact Check, also found no evidence for the implanting theory. 
Our ruling
A Facebook post claims COVID-19 testing could be done with mouth swabs, so maybe deeper swabbing is ""implanting something.""
Mouth swabs can be done for testing, though nasal swabs are considered more accurate. There's no evidence of ""implanting.""
We rate the statement Mostly False.

17.AreConspiracyTheorie,"
Have the internet and social media created a climate where Americans believe anything is possible? With headlines citing now as the age of conspiracy, is it really true? 
In a word, no. 
While it may be true that the internet has allowed people who believe in conspiracies to communicate more, it has not increased the number of Americans who believe in conspiracies, according to the data available.
Current beliefs
A ""conspiracy theory"" is a theory that explains an event or set of circumstances as the result of a secret plot, usually by powerful conspirators. 






For example, take Pizzagate, the theory that Washington elite engaged in child sex trafficking at the basement of a D.C. pizzeria, which 9% of the American population believe to be true.
Over 29% of the American population believe there is a ""Deep State"" working against President Donald Trump. Nineteen percent believe that the government is using chemicals to control the population.
These conspiracy theories are not simply restricted to a fringe population. At least 50% of Americans believe in at least one conspiracy theory, ranging from the idea that the 9/11 attacks were fake to the belief that former President Barack Obama was not born in the U.S. 

Historical data
There are no major comprehensive, longitudinal studies on Americans' attitudes toward conspiracy theories, mostly because it was not rigorously measured until about 10 to 20 years ago. 
However, researchers have done a considerate amount of work in recent years in an attempt to understand this apparent phenomenon. 
Political scientists Joseph E. Uscinski and Joseph M. Parent reviewed over 120 years of letters to the editor, from 1890 to 2010, for both The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune. 






In over 100,000 letters, this review showed absolutely no change in the amount of conspiracy theory belief over time. In fact, the percent of letters about conspiracy theories actually declined from the late 1800s to the 1960s and has remained steady since then. 
While these researchers looked at data only up until 2010, current polling has not shown any uptick in conspiracy theory belief since then. 
The end is near?
As Uscinski and Parent pointed out, this isn't the first time Americans may have felt surrounded by conspiracies.
In 2004, the Boston Globe stated that we are in the ""golden age of conspiracy theory.""
In 1994, the Washington Post declared it's the ""dawn of a new age of conspiracy theory.""
In 1964, The New York Times said conspiracy theories had ""grown weed like in this country.""
The list could go on and on, but the gist is clear.   






Whether it is the invention of the printing press, mass publishing, the telegraph, radio, cable, the internet or social media, researchers and the general public have historically proclaimed that this - or this, or this - new advance is the change-maker in political realities. 
While the internet has certainly made discussion between conspiracy theorists easier, there is no evidence at this time that belief in these theories has increased.

In April 2020, as conspiracy theories swirled about former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates' alleged connections to the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic, images supposedly showing an eerie quote ostensibly uttered by him circulated on social media.
Text from a February 1997 issue of George magazine was presented in such a way that suggested Gates had said an ""over-populated planet"" would be ""choked to extinction by a lung-attacking virus"":

Practically the only thing connecting Gates to the quote in this image is the neon green line drawn between them.
The above-displayed images are both genuine and both come from the February 1997 issue of George, a magazine founded by John F. Kennedy, Jr. and published between 1995 and 2001. Although this issue does feature a lengthy interview with Gates, the quote featured here comes from an entirely different article. 
The February 1997 issue of George magazine included a ""Survival Guide to the Future"" that featured various commentators describing how the world was ""now"" and providing their thoughts on what the world would be like in 2020. The actual article, titled ""A Nation's Future Foretold,"" was divided into themed sections such as transportation, education, environment, crime, warfare, and food. The quote shown in the viral image comes from the disease section of this article. Here's a screenshot from a digital copy of the magazine, which more clearly shows the author of this text:
 






The end of the article comes after a page break, where you can read the pull-quote in context:

Gates did not write that an ""over-populated planet"" would be ""choked to extinction by a lung-attacking virus."" This article was actually written by poet and science writer Arno Karlen. 
However, social media users did find an actual quote from Gates in this issue of George that they presented as equally controversial as the ""lung-attacking virus"" quote.  A second image showing an excerpt from this issue appears to show Gates talking about ""funding population control"":
This, again, is a genuine image from the February 1997 issue of George magazine. And this time, it is a genuine quote from Gates. He made this comment shortly after he was asked about how he keeps his personal opinions separate from his business decisions:

While this quote is often shared as if it revealed some secret and nefarious plot from the former Microsoft CEO, the truth is a bit more mundane. 
This quote was widely circulated by those who adhere to the idea that Gates was using the COVID-19 pandemic to give himself an opportunity to microchip the population via vaccines. The above-displayed quote shows, according to proponents of this conspiracy theory, that Gates has long been planning to take control of the global population. We took a deeper look into the ""ID2020"" conspiracy theory here.
However, the term ""population control"" isn't as literal as it may seem in this context. This term was widely used in the 1970s and '80s, but it fell out of fashion in the '90s and was replaced by terms such as ""reproductive health,"" ""family planning,"" and ""women's empowerment.""
In writing about the United Nations International Conference on Population and Development in 1994, the Christian Science Monitor noted a major philosophical difference between that year's conference and conferences from years past:
If there is a major philosophical difference in the 1994 version of the once-a-decade international conference on population, it is the shift from ""population control"" to ""women's empowerment"" -- especially in areas of reproductive health, education, and economic opportunities, which planners of the UN conference see as closely linked to fertility rates.
""Economic growth and improvement of quality of life have been fastest in those areas where women have higher status, and slowest where they face the greatest disadvantages,"" states the draft ""Programme of Action"" now being debated in New York.
Gates' quote in this 1997 interview may have been a bit outdated, but it was not indicative of a nefarious plot to enslave humankind. Rather, Gates was noting his charitable work with global organizations that support reproductive health programs. 
For example, in 1997, the year this interview was published, the Gates Foundation awarded a $2.2 million grant to Johns Hopkins University to ""support the Institute for Population and Reproductive Health to strengthen leadership and institutions in the developing countries."" Two years later in 1999, Bill and Melinda Gates donated $2.2 billion to United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).
Forbes explored Gates' thinking on ""population control"" in a 2011 profile:
That same epiphany for his public health philanthropy came even earlier. Bill's dad had set up a dinner at Seattle's posh Columbia Tower Club with the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH). While the meeting started with birth control -- among other efforts, PATH taught Chinese condom makers to test their products before shipping them -- Gates began consuming data that startled him. In society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls -- specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people -- the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes. ""It goes against common sense,"" Gates says. Most parents don't choose to have eight children because they want to have big families, it turns out, but because they know many of their children will die.
""If a mother and father know their child is going to live to adulthood, they start to naturally reduce their population size,"" says Melinda.
In terms of giving, Gates did a 180-degree turn. Rather than prevent births, he would aim his billions at saving the kids already born. ""We moved pretty heavily into vaccines once we understood that,"" says Gates.

33.DidAGBarrVisitJeffre,"
On Aug. 11, 2019, the New York Post ran a story that repeated uncritically a rumor originating from a convicted fraud and former mob informant. The informant claimed he had heard that ""US Attorney General William Barr personally made a hush-hush trip to the [the Metropolitan Correctional Center] two weeks ago, about the time [alleged sex-trafficker Jeffrey] Epstein was found in his cell with bruises around his neck."" Several news outlets repeated this claim, and it became entwined with various vague conspiracy theories alleging a nefarious connection between Barr and Epstein:

It was unclear what Barr was alleged to have done during his purported visit to the detention facility. The Post article, with the headline ""Jeffrey Epstein Could Have 'Paid' for Help with Suicide: Former Gotti Pal,"" relied solely on the speculative musings of a man named Lewis Kasman. Kasman's expertise on this topic, according to the Post's reporting, was that he had visited the same facility where Epstein was being kept ""several times"" in 1992, when Kasman's boss, mobster John Gotti, was held there.
Kasman, who had been referred to in media reports as Gotti's ""adopted son,"" gained notoriety after he ""ratted out much of the Gambino crime family"" as a paid FBI informant beginning in 1995. Years later, in 2010, Kasman would avoid jail time for ""obstruction of justice, lying to the FBI, fraud and racketeering"" thanks to his previous help aiding the FBI. In 2015, he was arrested in Florida for allegedly stealing money from his own lawyer. He has been the source of dubious claims in the past, including the baseless claim that ""John Gotti's brain was taken to Guantanamo for experiments.""
We reached out to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to ask if AG Barr had paid any visit to the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) during the window of time indicated by Kasman. In response, DOJ Office of Public Affairs Director Kerri Kupec called the claim ""preposterous,"" telling us via email that ""Attorney General Barr has never visited MCC."" She added that the suggestion of a quiet visit was dubious as well, reminding us ""the Attorney General has 24/7 FBI protective detail. So they would have had to be there, too.""
We also reached out to Brad Hamilton, the author of the Post story, to ask if Kasman provided any corroborating evidence that made him trust Kasman's speculation as reportable, given the informant's history of false or absurd statements. We have not yet received a response. All told, however, the claim has its origins in a man with a history of wild claims whose expertise on the topic is limited to his having made ""several"" visits to the same prison over two decades earlier. As such, we consider the claim without merit.

184.PolitiFactsLieoftheY,"
In the days after 17 people were viciously gunned down at a high school in Florida, the state's Republican governor called for tighter gun laws and President Donald Trump hosted victims' families in the State Dining Room.
The nation seemed steadfast in seeking answers and finding solutions.
""It's not going to be talk like it has been in the past,"" Trump said. ""It's been going on too long. Too many instances, and we're going to get it done.""
But in the shadows, the internet engine of hoaxes and smears had started.
The lies went like this: David Hogg, an outspoken student of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, was really a ""crisis actor"" coached on what to say. Hogg wasn't even from Florida, he was from California. Students, who began to advocate for restrictions on guns, had secretly organized before the shooting or were backed by radicals with a history of violence. Another student, Emma Gonzalez, was a communist with ties to Cuba. She even ripped up the U.S. Constitution.
The students and the country were about to learn a hard lesson about participating in democracy in 2018. That you don't have to be a politician to be on the receiving end of the internet's worst hoaxes. That the lies don't vanish after being debunked. That the same hoaxes will spread again after the next attack.
At least there was this: During a time of so little bipartisanship, the attacks on the Parkland students set off a shared outrage in nearly all political corners.
""Claiming some of the students on TV after #Parkland are actors is the work of a disgusting group of idiots with no sense of decency,"" wrote Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., on Twitter on Feb. 20.
""THIS CONSPIRACY THEORY IS INSANE,"" tweeted U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif. ""Our kids know David Hogg. My wife and I know his mom, who taught at our kids' elementary school before they moved to Florida. Although David is very articulate, he is not a crisis actor.""
In another year of lament about the lack of truth in politics, the attacks against Parkland's students stand out because of their sheer vitriol. Together, the lies against the Parkland students in the wake of unspeakable tragedy were the most significant falsehoods of 2018. We name them PolitiFact's Lie of the Year.
How the lies spread
School shootings have become regular occurrences in the United States: Columbine in 1999, Virginia Tech in 2007, and Sandy Hook in 2012. In the days after the Parkland shooting, the Florida students' grief became a demand for political solutions. They wanted their trauma to be the last.
The Saturday after the shooting, student Emma Gonzalez stood at a bank of microphones at a Fort Lauderdale rally and yelled through angry tears, ""They say that tougher gun laws do not decrease gun violence. We call BS! That us kids don't know what we're talking about. That we're too young to understand how the government works. We call BS!""
At the candlelight vigils and rallies held in the days immediately following the shooting, the students came together and developed plans. By Sunday, students appeared on all the morning news shows to announce their idea: a nationwide march, in Washington and in cities around the country, to demand action on guns. They called it the March for Our Lives.
At its outset, the march was political, and students went directly after the largest gun rights advocacy group in the country, the National Rifle Association.
""At the end of the day, this isn't about the red and blue, the GOP and the Democrats. This is about adults and kids. And at this point, you're either with us or against us,"" student Cameron Kasky said on Fox News Sunday. ""We are giving all our politicians a clean slate and in the next election, we are saying if you are accepting money from the NRA, there is a badge of shame on you because you are enabling things like this to happen.""
The online rumors and conspiracy theories started that weekend and really took off on the Monday and Tuesday a week after the shooting.
Relatively obscure online sites said that the students were ""crisis actors,"" and that student David Hogg, then a high school senior with journalism experience, was an actor from another state brought into Florida by anti-gun activists. Those rumors were fanned by Alex Jones' conspiracy website InfoWars, which played up the suggestion that Hogg was coached and from out of state. (The ""evidence"" for the claim was that before the shooting, when Hogg had been on vacation in California, a Los Angeles TV station had interviewed him about his interactions with an argumentative lifeguard.) PolitiFact rated both claims Pants on Fire.
Almost simultaneously, the online rumors moved from the fringes to the mainstream political battlefield. In Florida, a state legislator's aide made the claim about crisis actors to a Tampa Bay Times reporter on Feb. 20; the aide was fired for repeating false conspiracy theories, and Florida's House speaker apologized to the students.
Outright lies morphed into suspicions about the students' connections. Also on Feb. 20, Donald Trump Jr. liked a tweet by a conservative TV show host Graham Ledger that linked to a story by the Gateway Pundit website stating that David Hogg was ""coached on anti-Trump lines.""
On Wednesday, a full week after the shootings, the top trending video on YouTube was a clip that used actual news footage (the interview of Hogg on vacation) but claimed to show Hogg was an actor. YouTube removed the video and apologized for it, telling media outlets: ""Because the video contained footage from an authoritative news source, our system misclassified it. As soon as we became aware of the video, we removed it from Trending and from YouTube for violating our policies. We are working to improve our systems moving forward.""
Russian-linked Twitter accounts got into the action, too, promoting messages that attacked Parkland students, according to analysts at the German Marshall Fund's Alliance for Securing Democracy project. (The bipartisan group tracks the efforts of autocratic countries to undermine democracies.)
The Russians also pushed out messages that supported Parkland students' agenda, said Bret Schafer, an analyst with the project.
""In the case of Parkland, the Kremlin and its proxies obviously did not care whether we enacted stricter gun control laws -- they cared about keeping us fighting amongst ourselves,"" Schafer said.
Students speak out
The outright lies against the Parkland students were easily debunked. Journalists from around the country descended on south Florida, documenting the shooting's aftermath and interviewing student eyewitnesses.
In a February TV interview at a rally at the state capital in Tallahassee, Hogg said he was undeterred by online smears and believed they came from people who didn't want to see any new restrictions on guns.   
""These people are trying to stop us, and they are actually helping us out a lot, because my Twitter following has tripled over the past, like, day essentially, and I think that is in part because of these trolls,"" he said. ""For that, I'm honestly kind of thankful."" (Hogg now has 906,000 followers.)
The lies seemed to generate sympathy for the students ahead of the March for Our Lives rally in Washington March 24. But they didn't fade entirely into the background.
Sarah Rumpf, a reporter for conservative news website RedState, thought she found a scoop tucked in the middle of an interview Hogg gave to CBS. In the interview, Hogg described the day of the shooting, and said, ""I got my camera and got on my bike and rode as fast as I could three miles from my house to the school to get as much video and to get as many interviews as I could because I knew that this could not be another mass shooting.""
""Something doesn't add up here,"" Rumpf wrote. ""If Hogg was at school when the shooting began, saying he heard gunshots and the fire alarm, then why is he talking about riding a bike three miles to get to school on the day of the shooting?""
Her March 26 story published quickly and spread quicker. Versions appeared on InfoWars, a leading conspiracy website, and the Gateway Pundit. It bounced to lesser known blogs, and across social media where it was shared by thousands of people, according to data kept by Hoaxy, which tracks social media misinformation.
But the story was bogus. Very shortly, Rumpf knew the premise was wrong. Hogg had raced back to the school around 6 p.m. the evening of the shooting to interview students. Hogg was actually at the school during the shooting and shot a video on his cellphone while taking cover in a classroom closet.
Rumpf updated her post and apologized for the error. ""If you don't read further, just know this: David Hogg was absolutely on campus during the shooting,"" Rumpf wrote. ""I have zero doubt about that, and deeply regret the part I played in adding confusion and animosity to an already heated debate.""
In the weeks and months after the shooting, adults who knew the students got a first-hand look at how ugly American politics was. In 2016, conspiracy theories were aimed at politicians like Hillary Clinton or Ted Cruz's father. Now it was the kids next door.
PolitiFact contacted March for Our Lives for this story. They declined interviews.
Jeff Foster, an Advanced Placement government teacher at Marjory Stoneman Douglas, told PolitiFact he was mortified by the false information that spread about his students. It steered some conversations in the days immediately after the shooting.
""I had legitimate friends asking if David Hogg is a real person -- it was crazy,"" he said. ""To this day, someone sees one story that sort of contradicts a real narrative, and they just take it as absolute truth.""
Foster said that the students took the false attacks in stride: ""They just keep trudging on -- they stayed on message. They were frustrated with misinformation, but I don't think it deterred them.""
Political fights use fakery as a weapon
Rumors about ""crisis actors"" have occurred after other shootings, but Parkland elevated it, said Kate Starbird, a University of Washington professor who studies misinformation online during crisis events.
""Before Parkland, I used to talk about 'crisis actors' rumors and only a few people would know what I was talking about,"" she said. ""After Parkland, everyone had heard the term. Part of this was likely media coverage of the misinformation -- it's hard to disentangle the misinformation strategies from the amplification effects.""
U.S. shooting events have become thoroughly politicized, she said, and online commenters move quickly to blame the shooting on a particular group to score political points.
""This activity does appear to be increasing in volume and organization,"" she said.
PolitiFact has debunked multiple false claims of shooters having particular political ideologies. After a May school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas, a fake Facebook profile depicted the alleged gunman wearing a hat showing support for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential bid, with a background photo displaying a banner espousing anti-fascists, or Antifa, views.
In recent years, journalists have debated whether reporting on fringe actors or extremist political ideology has a harmful amplification effect. In some cases, it likely does. But in the case of Parkland, PolitiFact began receiving reader requests almost immediately to fact-check claims as people online saw the misinformation. They wanted documentation that it wasn't true.
Parkland's impact on laws
The attacks on the Parkland students seemed like a proxy battle over gun control. If the students could be discredited, their calls for changing law would be ignored. But events didn't play out like that.  
In Florida, Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican and a longtime ally of the National Rifle Association, quickly signed legislation raising the state's age to purchase guns from 18 to 21.
Scott said he opposed parts of the bill that included an enhanced waiting period to buy a gun, but overall he believed the legislation would create a safer environment at schools, and he specifically praised the students as he signed the legislation.
""To the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School: You made your voices heard. You didn't let up. And, you fought until there was change. You helped change our state. You made a difference,"" Scott said in prepared remarks.
A few weeks later, the March for Our Lives was held in Washington and broadcast nationally. Throughout 2018, states around the country enacted stricter laws, and some corporations moved to cut ties with the NRA.
While Congress continues to reject a ban on assault weapons or expanding mandatory background checks, President Donald Trump signed a bill to make improvements to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS.
Sean Kirkendall, policy director of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, noted that a bill to expand background checks introduced in 2017 saw the number of cosponsors soar after Parkland to more than 200. That level of support for a gun violence prevention bill is unprecedented, he said.
Internet companies held to account
In July, members of the U.S. House of Representatives grilled tech executives on why they permitted online conspiracy theorists to promote falsehoods on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.
""I represent Parkland, Florida, and in this discussion of social media, the first thing that comes to mind, for me, is the savage attacks on the student survivors of Stoneman Douglas,"" said U.S. Rep. Ted Deutch, a Democrat. ""One of the most virulent strains of these attacks was that the students didn't survive a school shooting, that they were crisis actors, that they were planted by some mysterious cabal to finally get Congress to do something about gun violence.""
Deutch noted the rumors that InfoWars had promoted against the students and the site's previous notoriety for promoting a conspiracy theory that the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting had never happened.
""How may strikes does a conspiracy theorist, who attacks grieving parents and student survivors of mass shootings, get? How many strikes are they entitled to before they can no longer post those kinds of horrific attacks?"" Deutch asked the tech executives.
Juniper Downs of YouTube said a channel typically could violate YouTube policies three times before it was removed. Monika Bickert of Facebook said the company used a similar model but declined to give a number of violations required, noting that it ""depends on the nature of the content that is violating our policies.""
A month later, the tech sites, led by Apple, all banned InfoWars from their platforms.
In the case of Parkland, it's hard not to conclude that the lies didn't stop the student movement. It may have in fact fueled it.
""Every attempt to attack the student survivors online brought more attention to what they were trying to do to mobilize their community and their generation,"" Deutch told PolitiFact recently.
He also said he believed fast debunkings were critical going forward.
""At a time when it's so easy to spread misinformation on social media and on the Internet, I think one of the big takeaways out of all of this -- and frankly the other attempts to spread misinformation over the past couple of years -- is to call it out,"" Deutch says now. ""To not let it get legs on these conspiracy theory websites only to see it seep into mainstream social media, but to call it out right from the start.""
Update: This report has been updated to note that Rumpf's story was changed soon after publication. We originally said it was within hours, but the precise timing is unclear.

The spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease in 2020 sparked a flurry of conspiracy theories concerning where it originated, how it spread, and who was responsible for it. One such theory blamed the disease on Bill Gates and claimed that the former Microsoft CEO had started a pandemic so that he could insert microchips into people around the globe under the guise of providing vaccinations or for other purposes. 
This conspiracy theory is propped up by little more than coincidences and misinterpretations. For instance, in April 2020 social media users started to share a link to a patent supposedly owned by Microsoft that pertained to the micro-chipping of individuals for financial gain.

This patent was especially insidious, users claimed, because it carried the numbers ""666,"" the biblical ""mark of the beast,"" and the letters WO, which they claimed stood for the ""World Order.""  

The above-displayed screenshots pertain to a genuine patent filed by Microsoft. However, this patent does not involve a plan to microchip individuals, ""WO"" does not stand for World Order, and one has to ignore the existence of 11 other characters in order to arrive at the conclusion that this patent carries the devil's number.  
This patent is for a ""cryptocurrency system"" that ""uses body activity data."" Microsoft Technology Licensing applied for this patent in June 2019, and the patent was published a few months later in March 2020 under the number ""WO2020060606A1.""  






The patent, which has not been granted as of this writing, makes no mention of microchips.
The diagrams included in this patent (and shown in the screenshots above) show how the ""person,"" ""user device,"" and ""sensor"" are all distinct items. The text of the patent further explains that the ""user device"" in the diagram may include wearables, such as a smart watch, or cell phones, laptops, or tablets:
User device 130 may include any device capable of processing and storing data/information and communicating over communication network 120. For example, user device 130 may include personal computers, servers, cell phones, tablets, laptops, smart devices (e.g. smart watches or smart televisions). An exemplary embodiment of user device 130 is illustrated in FIG. 6.
The patent provides two options for the sensor. First, the sensor could be incorporated into one of the aforementioned devices, such as a smartphone. The ""sensor"" may also be its own standalone component:
Sensor 140 may be configured to sense the body activity of user 145. As illustrated in FIG. 1, sensor 140 may be a separate component from user device 130 and be operably and/or communicatively connected to user device 130. Alternatively, sensor 140 may be included and integrated in user device 130. For example, user device 130 may be a wearable device having sensor 140 therein. The sensor 140 may transmit information/data to user device 130. 
At no point in this patent does Microsoft suggest that the sensor would be a microchip implanted into a person's skin.
So what about the claim that this is World Order patent 666? As we noted above, this patent was truly published under the number ""WO2020060606A1."" It truly contains the number 666 (or, more accurately, 060606). However ""patent WO2020060606A1"" is not the same as ""patent 666."" 
Furthermore, the ""WO"" at the start of this patent does not stand for ""World Order."" It is shorthand for WIPO, the World Intellectual Property Organization, which issued this patent. The ""A1"" at the end of this patent number signifies that this is only a published patent. The ""kind code"" B1 is applied to granted patents. 
We reached out to Microsoft for more information about this patent and will update this article if we hear back. 
To sum up: Microsoft has applied for a patent that deals with the development of a cryptocurrency system based on tracking body-activity data. However, this patent focuses on wearable technology, such as a smart watch, not implanted microchips, and while patent number ""WO2020060606A1"" contains three ""6's,"" this appears to be little more than a coincidence.

Origin
On Oct. 1, 2015, ten people (nine innocent victims plus the gunman) died in a mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon. The incident marked the 294th mass shooting in 2015 alone and prompted yet another renewal of a national gun control debate in the U.S. 






Folks on both sides of that political debate would likely agree that the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012 was a pivotal point in a perpetual American gun control controversy. Perhaps due to the unique horrors of that event, an unusually high number of conspiracy theories grew out of it: Some gun control advocates on social media later described the tragedy as proof positive Americans weren't interested in changing gun laws despite the exceptional pain inflicted by the incident, while some gun rights advocates asserted the events in Newtown were a government-sponsored false flag engineered to artificially justify a ""gun grab.""
The latter camp wasn't much of a fringe movement -- a key law enforcement figure of the Roseburg shooting, Sheriff John Hanlin, had shared Sandy Hook conspiracy material on his own Facebook wall prior to the Umpqua Community College shooting. The Sandy Hook shooting was somewhat of a watershed moment for Second Amendment ""truthers,"" and the conspiracies that sprang forth from it began coloring subsequent (and in some instances, prior) high-profile shootings or attacks on civilians in America.
One of the common conspiracy themes that gained traction after the Newtown shooting involved ""crisis actors,"" individuals who had (to that point) been primarily known to populate disaster drills. As the notion of gun grabbing conspiracies became more commonplace, the term was appropriated by folks who believed the faces of those grieving at (staged) shooting scenes or subsequent vigils were in fact paid government operatives assigned to fabricate the appearance of mourning. A common iteration of the rumor involved photographs taken at crime scenes or vigils in Newtown (Connecticut), Aurora (Colorado), Boston:

After the 1 October 2015 shooting in Roseburg, the meme was altered to include what was purportedly yet another appearance by the ""same girl"" seen previously crying in photos from Aurora, Boston, and Sandy Hook. (Presumably, the high-level false flag planners didn't have access to social media and remained unaware their schemes had been unraveled and revealed months earlier):

The same technology that enabled people to compile and spread the photo set shown above also allowed anyone interested in the rumor to quite quickly determine whether the ""same girl"" was indeed depicted in all four images included in the meme.
The claim was bizarre partly because the individuals involved were not nameless, faceless mourners of whom no trace was found shortly after the respective tragedies. The largest of the images was also the most iconic and heartbreaking: the photograph (taken at Sandy Hook Elementary) that captured the moment during which Carlee Soto learned her sister Victoria Soto was among those killed. The image was not the only one available of Carlee Soto crying, but similar, easily discovered images didn't fit the meme:
 






To the right of Soto in the photo collection (which in several iterations is inaccurately labeled as being from ""Boston"") is Amanda Medek. Medek's sister Micayla Medek was among the dead in the 20 July 2012 Aurora, Colorado, theater shooting, and the image of Medek sitting on steps was one of several captured of her that day:

Photographs taken during happier times definitively show that Medek (at the far right) and Soto look nothing alike (save for the moments during which each respectively learned their sisters had been murdered):

Pictured to the left of Soto is Emma McDonald, who (unlike Soto and Medek) appeared to be connected to the victims of the Boston Marathon bombings solely by her presence at a vigil for the victims. As such, McDonald's link to that tragedy was more fleeting (and photographs of her were harder to come by).
The young woman shown at the bottom (after the Roseburg shooting) was identified as Jessica Vazquez, seen crying and hugging aunt Leticia Alcaraz. (Alcaraz's daughter Lucero Alcaraz was among the dead at Umpqua Community College):

Following a mass shooting in San Bernardino on 2 December 2015 an iteration of the rumor held the ""same girl"" was again spotted amid news coverage of the event, albeit this time in a larger crowd shot:

While all the young women seen in the photographs had long, brown hair (initially), that factor alone didn't make a strong case for a massive government conspiracy encompassing law enforcement agencies at several levels in multiple states (and eventually, multiple countries). In May 2017, the conspiracy theory popped up again after 22 people were killed in a bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England. The ""same girl"" was purportedly photographed in Manchester but unlike the earlier photos, the depicted individual was blonde. She was not identified in the Reuters image, a caption for which indicated it was taken at a crisis center in Manchester City's Etihad Stadium:
 
The similarities ended with hairstyles and grief-stricken expressions (and in the latter case, the depicted woman was not a brunette). Four of the six women depicted were identified by name at the time they were photographed (the fifth appeared to be a bystander, and the sixth unidentified) and none was transient to the tragedies with which they were associated or disappeared afterwards: Medek and Soto (relatives of victims in tragedies that were not exceptionally recent) went on to appear in multiple photographs and interviews about the respective incidents. In subsequent iterations in Paris and Manchester, the conspiracy broadened in scope to suggest the ""same girl"" was jetted around the globe to visit the scenes of attacks and shootings.
Shortly after the Umpqua tragedy, Soto remarked that the continued use of the photograph seen above in the media exacerbated her pain tremendously, and all four of the women initially depicted were likely deeply distressed by the appropriation of their personal mourning for the purposes of advancing a conspiracy narrative.

208.WereUNVehiclesandTru,"
On 24 June 2016, Facebook user Jeff Stern published a Facebook status update alongside three images of United Nations (UN) armored vehicles he'd purportedly spotted on that date along Interstate 81 (I-81) near Lexington, Virginia:


@PatriotByGod @Veteran4Trump What's with the UN trucks in Kentucky? Houston has tanks on railcars near downtown. What's POTUS planning?
-- Whitehawk (@johnacole01) June 26, 2016

The images and post were shared tens of thousands of times on Facebook, and they even inspired their own Daily Mail article pondering whether ""the U.N. is preparing [to respond to] economic collapse in America."" The Daily Mail (a publication that often does not allow the truth to stand in the way of a good story) apparently based their ""reporting"" on nothing more than some Facebook-posted photographs:

Military U.N. vehicles have been spotted in Virginia, shocking motorists and sparking conspiracy theories. 
The white trucks, equipped with large off-road tires, were seen being transported on Interstate 81 on Friday. They appear to be Alpine Armoring's Pit-Bull VX SWAT Truck models.
Jeff Stern posted photos of the vehicles on Facebook, writing: 'Can't begin to tell you how many of these I passed today on 81 near Lexington VA. Interesting times ahead!'
[Stern's] post sparked website Liberty is viral to ask: 'Are these U.N. troops here preparing for economic collapse in America? Is this related to Iran ships approaching the U.S. border?' while Alex Jones posted a video warning of the 'U.N. takeover of America.'
The U.N. is an intergovernmental organisation with 193 member states.
Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict.
Unlike the Daily Mail, we contacted Alpine Armoring, the manufacturer named in their article, to inquire about the images. According to an individual with whom we spoke at Alpine, the vehicles seen in these photographs were purchased by the United Nations for use outside the United States. A number of defense industry manufacturers are based in and around Washington, D.C. (a region that includes Virginia) for obvious logistical reasons, and the representative confirmed that the trucks were ordered by the UN for use in locations abroad.
After manufacturing, the UN vehicles require transportation to their final ports of call inside the U.S., and driving them to those final embarkation points could potentially put several thousand miles on them prior to their being loaded onto cargo planes or ships, so the trucks seen here were loaded onto a flatbed truck and transported in that fashion. It is a reasonable inference that, depending on their route and final destination, the same trucks would be spotted in other Southern states (particularly if they were to be sent abroad via a cargo ship leaving from a Southern port). It isn't clear whether rumors of the trucks being spotted in Kentucky were accurate, or if social media users confused Lexington, Virginia, with Lexington, Kentucky.
It is true that the UN vehicles spotted in Lexington were transported via I-81, but they were on their way to an undisclosed destination abroad and are not being deployed for use within the United States. The rumor associated with them was not unlike reports from October 2014 about a ""large truck convoy"" in Virginia, which also did not result in the imposition of martial law or a UN takeover. It also bore resemblance to long-circulating rumors about the uncovering of a plot to impose martial law via an overturned tractor-trailer carrying portentous signs, which has traveled around the web since 1999 despite the fact its claims never came to pass.

It's been almost six months since hundreds of pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 in a brazen attempt to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election. 
Since then, some have tried to pass the blame onto others, like antifa. Others tried to claim that it was just an ordinary ""tourist visit.""
Now, a new theory has emerged: the entire breach was secretly orchestrated by the FBI.
This new idea originated from a June 14 article by Revolver News, a right-leaning website run by Darren Beattie -- a former Trump White House speechwriter who was fired in 2018 after he appeared on a panel with a white nationalist. In 2020, Beattie was appointed to a commission to oversee U.S. Holocaust memorials.
The story's premise was quickly and prominently promoted by Fox News host Tucker Carlson. It soon made its way to the Twitter accounts of Republican politicians, like Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Matt Gaetz of Florida, and was amplified in various viral social media posts.
Revolver's article, headlined, ""Unindicted Co-Conspirators in 1/6 Cases Raise Disturbing Questions of Federal Foreknowledge,"" speculates that because there are unindicted, unnamed co-conspirators included in some of the Capitol rioters federal charging documents, it's reasonable to assume that those people are FBI informants or agents. 
It also questions whether these figures were ""instigators"" during the storming of the Capitol, suggesting that not only was the government involved, but its agents also caused violence and damage, and did nothing to stop it.
The story never answers its own questions and only offers circumstantial evidence, including the fact that informants and undercover FBI operatives were involved in the foiled October 2020 plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and take over the state government.
Steven D'Antuono, the former director of the Detroit FBI field office, was promoted to help lead the FBI's Washington, D.C., office after his team successfully thwarted the kidnapping. He is now working on the Capitol riot cases. The story claims this is suspicious, and says D'Antuono was ""quietly promoted."" But the FBI issued a press release about the news and local media wrote stories about it.
In any case, this comparison is fraught. The plot in Michigan never happened, as is the case with most schemes that involve undercover agents and result in criminal charges. 
More importantly, experts explained that, under almost any circumstances, undercover government operatives and informants cannot be described in government filings as co-conspirators. The main reason: A component of criminal conspiracy is the agreement to commit a crime. That isn't what undercover operatives do.
""An undercover FBI informant or agent cannot be an unindicted co-conspirator,"" said Ira P. Robbins, a law and justice professor at American University who has studied and written about unindicted co-conspirators. ""The elements of the crime of conspiracy include the specific intent to commit the target crime. The FBI informant or agent would not have that intent.""
Lisa Griffin, a law professor at Duke University who specializes in constitutional criminal procedure and federal criminal justice, called the suggestion ""absurd.""
""Undercover agents do not commit the crime of conspiracy by conducting an investigation,"" she said. ""Referencing unindicted co-conspirators is disfavored but necessary in some situations, although never to document the role of law enforcement agents.""
PolitiFact reached out to Revolver News but did not hear back. The FBI declined to comment.
The Justice Department's manual, a reference for U.S. attorneys and department employees responsible for federal prosecutions, stipulates that, in almost all cases, federal prosecutors generally should not identify unindicted co-conspirators in conspiracy indictments. 
""Ordinarily, there is no need to name a person as an unindicted co-conspirator in an indictment in order to fulfill any legitimate prosecutorial interest or duty,"" the provision says. 
""For purposes of indictment itself, it is sufficient, for example, to allege that the defendant conspired with 'another person or persons known.' In any indictment where an allegation that the defendant conspired with 'another person or persons known' is insufficient, some other generic reference should be used, such as 'Employee 1' or 'Company 2'. The use of non-generic descriptors, like a person's actual initials, is usually an unnecessarily-specific description and should not be used.""
Griffin noted that the most famous example of an unindicted co-conspirator was Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal. Another is when Donald Trump was called ""individual one"" in the indictment of his former lawyer Michael Cohen. Trump was all but an unindicted co-conspirator, she said, although not actually identified as one.
Besides being a sitting president, there are multiple other reasons why someone might be included in an indictment as an unindicted co-conspirator: They haven't been identified, there isn't enough evidence to bring charges against them, they've been granted immunity of some kind, various cooperation deals, prosecutorial guidelines that counsel against charging, or other shortfalls in the cases that require delaying or forgoing charges.  
The Revolver story singles out certain unnamed persons in the government's filings for Thomas Caldwell, a 65-year-old alleged Capitol rioter and member of the Oath Keepers, a far-right anti-government militia group. 
But those same documents contradict the article's own premise. 
The indictment begins by identifying ""PERSON ONE"" as the leader of the Oath Keepers. It's well known that person is Stewart Rhodes. Rhodes has publicly accused prosecutors of manufacturing made-up crimes. There's no evidence he's an undercover government agent.
The Washington Post reported that there's reason to believe that ""PERSON TWO"" in the documents, who the Revolver article depicted as suspicious, is Caldwell's wife. She has not been charged with a crime. The indictment says that Caldwell and person two took ""selfie"" photos of themselves on the balcony and in other areas around the capitol. The Post reported that, on Facebook, Caldwell posted photos of him and his wife, writing ""Us storming the castle. Please share. Sharon is right with me. I am such an instigator!""

A photograph captured in court documents shows Thomas Caldwell with an unidentified person on the Capitol balcony. (U.S. Department of Justice)
In two separate June hearings in front of Congress, FBI director Christopher Wray and Pentagon officials answered questions about the failure to adequately prepare for and respond to the Jan. 6 attack.
Wray, who was appointed by Trump in 2017, told the House Judiciary Committee on June 10 that the FBI field office in Virginia issued a warning on Jan. 5, sent to the Capitol police, that extremists were preparing to travel to D.C. to commit violence.
He added that ""almost none"" of the close to 500 people charged or found to be involved in the attack so far had been under FBI investigation previously. 
""You can be darn sure that we are going to be looking hard at how we can do better, how we can do more, how we can do things differently in terms of collecting, analyzing and disseminating intelligence,"" Wray said.
A proposed bipartisan, independent commission to examine the Jan. 6 riot --modeled on the one established to investigate the 9/11 terror attacks with equal Republicans and Democrats -- failed in the Senate. The final vote was 54-35, with Republicans withholding the votes necessary to bring the bill up for debate.

Confronting Dr. Anthony Fauci at a Senate committee hearing on the COVID-19 pandemic, Sen. Rand Paul argued that the United States collaborated with the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China to make a more deadly coronavirus.
The Kentucky Republican made the explosive allegation the day after Fox News talk show host Tucker Carlson made another far-reaching accusation, stating that a recent article ""makes it clear that, more than any other single living American, Tony Fauci is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.""
""Dr. Fauci, we don't know whether the pandemic started in a lab in Wuhan or evolved naturally, but we should want to know,"" Paul said in a Senate hearing. ""To arrive at the truth, the U.S. government should admit that the Wuhan Virology Institute was experimenting to enhance the coronavirus' ability to infect humans.
""Juicing up super-viruses is not new,"" Paul continued. ""Scientists in the U.S. have long known how to mutate animal viruses to infect humans. For years, Dr. Ralph Baric, a virologist in the U.S., has been collaborating with Dr. Shi Zhengli of the Wuhan Virology Institute, sharing his discoveries about how to create super-viruses. This gain-of-function research has been funded by the NIH.""
Fauci, director of the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the federal government's leading voice on COVID-19, rebutted Paul by saying: ""The NIH and NIAID categorically have not funded gain-of-function research to be conducted in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.""
In an interview with PolitiFact at United Facts of America: A Festival of Fact-Checking shortly after the hearing, Fauci called Paul's accusation ""preposterous."" 
""He was saying we funded a kind of research in China that could lead to dangerous research; that's not the case. So, what he was saying was just absolutely not true,"" Fauci said. 
Fauci added: ""So, in a very minor collaboration, as part of a subcontract of a grant, we had a collaboration with some Chinese scientists. And what he conflated is that therefore we were involved in creating the virus, which is the most ridiculous, majestic leap I've ever heard of.""
Asked if he was confident the virus developed naturally, Fauci said, ""I think that we should continue to investigate what went on in China until we find out, to the best of our ability, exactly what happened. ... I'm perfectly in favor of any investigation that looks into the origin of the virus.""
While there is no hard evidence that the COVID-19 virus was developed in a lab, the Wuhan lab did use reverse genetics on bat coronaviruses, which some scientists believe fits the definition of gain-of-function research. 
Proponents of this form of study, which involves forcing the evolution of a pathogen, sometimes to boost its infectivity and lethality, say it helps researchers spot potential threats to human health and allows them to figure out ways to tackle a new virus. Critics claim that the practice constitutes a massive biosafety risk. 
The conversation around gain-of-function gathered new momentum from an 11,000-word article, posted on Medium on May 2, by Nicholas Wade, a former science writer and editor for the New York Times. It argues that evidence is stronger that the virus leaked from a lab than that it occurred naturally. 
Officials and researchers are also paying more attention to the possibility that the virus somehow leaked from the lab. But there's still nothing conclusive.
""Ultimately, without any proper and thorough investigation having been conducted, the origins of COVID-19 remain a completely open question,"" said Nikolai Petrovsky, director of endocrinology at Flinders Medical Centre and professor of medicine at Flinders University in Australia. 
Here's a look at what we know and don't know about the origin of the virus that produced COVID-19.
RELATED: Can scientific uncertainties about COVID-19 be fact-checked?
Basis for Paul's attack: Wuhan research
The basis for Paul's attack is federal funding for a 2014 project at the lab in Wuhan, the city where the coronavirus outbreak was first documented. PolitiFact has previously looked into unproven claims about U.S. research funding and the lab. 
In 2014, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the NIH arm that Fauci heads, awarded a $3.4 million grant to the New York-based EcoHealth Alliance, which aims to protect people from viruses that jump from species to species. The alliance has projects across 30 countries, including Thailand, Vietnam and China. 
The group hired the virology lab in Wuhan to conduct genetic analyses of bat coronaviruses collected in Yunnan province, about 800 miles southwest of Wuhan. The research was considered crucial in part because coronaviruses had previously emerged in China and begun to spread among humans. EcoHealth Alliance paid the lab $598,500 over five years. The lab had secured approval from both the U.S. State Department and the NIH. 
Fauci has advocated for gain-of-function research in the past. In a 2011 article he co-wrote for the Washington Post, he promoted it as a means to study influenza viruses. 
All parties involved in the grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology have denied that it involved gain-of-function research. The grant was approved in May 2014. Five months later, the Obama administration announced it would not fund new projects that involved gain-of-function research, citing safety and security risks, though there's an exception in the moratorium that allows it for research ""urgently necessary to protect public health or national security.""
Early in the pandemic, the consensus among public health experts was that the COVID-19 coronavirus evolved naturally in a bat and jumped to humans through an intermediary species. But since then, amid calls by Fauci and others for deeper investigation of what happened in China, scientists have publicly raised questions about whether a virus was collected at the Wuhan lab and then escaped. Those questions remain unanswered.
More attention is being paid to two key questions about the origin of this coronavirus: 


Could the virus have leaked from a lab?


Did gain-of-function research create SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19?


Lab-leak theory
So far, there is no hard proof to support either the theory that the virus had natural origins or the theory that it leaked from a lab, said Richard Ebright, a professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Rutgers University, who has frequently been cited by proponents of the lab-leak hypothesis, including Paul. 
""At this point in time, all scientific data related to the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and the epidemiology of COVID-19 are equally consistent with a natural-accident origin or a laboratory-accident origin,"" he told PolitiFact.
Scientists open to the lab-leak theory have cited three pieces of circumstantial evidence in support of the hypothesis: 
The first is simply the site of the outbreak. The city of Wuhan is, according to Ebright, ""tens of kilometers from, and outside the flight range of, the nearest known horseshoe bat colonies."" Furthermore, the first cases of the coronavirus occurred in September when cold temperatures drive horseshoe bats into hibernation. 
Second, the first outbreak occurred close to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where researchers studied bat coronaviruses, including the world's closest relative to SARS-CoV-2. The laboratory searched for horseshoe bat colonies in caves in Yunnan province, and then brought those viruses back to Wuhan, where they were mass-produced, genetically manipulated and studied. 
Third, Ebright says, some of the bat-SARS-related coronavirus projects at the Wuhan Institute were conducted at biosafety standards that would pose a potentially high risk of infection if laboratory staff were to come in contact with the virus.
Skeptics of the lab-leak theory, however, have argued that an alternate explanation is better founded in evidence. In their view, it's more likely that the coronavirus evolved naturally in bats and then jumped to humans either directly or by way of an intermediary species such as pangolins or raccoon dogs. Past diseases, including SARS, a similar coronavirus, have infected humans through intermediaries.
An intermediary species could have been brought to Wuhan and infected a human at a wildlife market. The first cases of SARS-CoV-2 ""were connected to not one but several markets where (people) sold wildlife or wildlife products,"" said Robert Garry, a virologist at Tulane Medical School. In fact, two different genetic lineages of SARS-CoV-2 were circulating early -- both linked to wildlife markets, he said. 
It seems unlikely, Garry said, that two distinct strains of a new virus leaked from the Wuhan lab and made their way to two different places that sold animals susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. 
However, it's still not obvious that the pandemic began in a wildlife market. An early and massive outbreak of the coronavirus did occur at Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, which was previously speculated to be the origin site of the pandemic. But a team of investigators from the World Health Organization sent to dig into the pandemic's origins did not find any animals infected with the coronavirus at a market, and neither have Chinese researchers who have tested tens of thousands of specimens. This means that there's no proof of animal-to-human transmission at Huanan or at other markets.
""To my knowledge, no one has reported finding the virus in a live animal (or a frozen body part of an animal) in even one market, whether in Wuhan, elsewhere in Hubei province, or south in Kunming city, or elsewhere in Yunnan province or anywhere else in China or outside China,"" said Daniel Lucey, an infectious-disease specialist at Georgetown University. 
Joel Wertheim, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California San Diego and proponent of the naturally-occurring theory, acknowledged that this theory leaves unanswered questions about the virus' origins, such as the missing intermediary species and the route the virus took to Wuhan.
""But not having answers to difficult scientific questions shouldn't force us to default to conspiracy theories,"" he said. ""It took scientists decades of research to find the chimpanzee host populations for the HIV/AIDS pandemic.""
Gain-of-function theory
The lab leak theory is distinct from the hypothesis that gain-of-function research created the new coronavirus, said Alina Chan, a molecular biologist at the Broad Institute of Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The lab leak theory ""can be as simple as a researcher being infected by an animal or even another infected person in remote areas, and then bringing it into one of the most densely populated cities on Earth."" The gain-of-function hypothesis supposes both that a virus leaked from the Wuhan Institute and that scientists there tampered with it in ways that could have made it more infective or deadly. 
This isn't to say that scientists believe that the new coronavirus is a bioweapon designed to wreak havoc on human society. But some have entertained the possibility that a virus, modified through well-intentioned but risky experiments, escaped its enclosure and had the same effect. 
The closest known relative to SARS-CoV-2 is a bat coronavirus called RaTG13, which was discovered after miners cleaning bat guano in Yunnan Province developed pneumonia. RaTG13 was collected and sequenced by researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The genetic makeup of RaTG13 is 96% similar to that of the new coronavirus. 
""While 96% sounds close, in evolutionary terms, it is quite distant, and it would take decades of evolution for the genome of RaTG13 to resemble that of SARS-CoV-2,"" Garry told Health Feedback in March 2021. ""The difference is about 1,200 bases or 400 amino acids. Gain-of-function research cannot close that gap. This would require a virus much closer than RaTG13, at least 99% similar or more likely 99.9% similar.""
Lab-leak-theory proponents have alleged that gain-of-function research was conducted on RaTG13 or one of eight SARS-like coronaviruses collected in Yunnan to create the new coronavirus at the Wuhan lab. 
There's no hard evidence that research of this kind created the novel coronavirus. Even scientists relatively open to the theory have been restrained in their speculation and have pushed back on those who have claimed that some ""smoking gun"" proves that the virus was manipulated. 
However, some scientists told PolitiFact that the Wuhan lab did conduct gain-of-function research on bat viruses, some of which was funded by the Ecohealth Alliance grant.
MIT biologist Kevin Esvelt reviewed a paper that was published with financial assistance from the grant for PolitiFact in February. According to Esvelt, certain techniques that the researchers used seemed to meet the definition of gain-of-function research, but their work was not related to the virus that causes COVID-19. Esvelt told PolitiFact that ""the work reported in this specific paper definitely did NOT lead to the creation of SARS-CoV-2,"" because the genetic sequences of the virus studied in the paper differ from that of the new coronavirus. 
Ebright, the Rutgers biologist, also said that the work described in the paper met several definitions of gain-of-function research. ""The work is far outside the bounds of normal biomedical research,"" he added. 
On the other hand, Wertheim and Garry said they didn't believe the paper referenced gain-of-function experiments. ""Although this study uses recombinant RNA technology, I would not consider it a gain-of-function study,"" said Wertheim. The researchers ""did not continue to let these viruses propagate in cell lines to adapt and enhance their pathogenicity or transmissibility."" 
It might seem strange that scientists could disagree over a question as seemingly clear-cut as whether or not a specific experiment involved gain-of-function research. However, the term ""gain-of-function"" refers to a wide variety of interventions, and the definition has shifted over time, making it easy for scientists to talk past one another. 
The original definition of gain-of-function included ""any selection process involving an alteration of genotypes and their resulting phenotypes,"" which, according to Alina Chan, ""covers a ton of research that doesn't even come close to risky pathogen research."" Subsequent definitions have narrowly targeted obviously dangerous experiments that would enhance the transmissibility and deadliness of ""potential pandemic pathogens."" 
What the paper shows is that the researchers at the Wuhan Institute used reverse genetics to create coronaviruses that do not exist in nature and then tested whether they could replicate in human cells. However, Wertheim said, ""similar recombinant RNA approaches -- inserting virus surface proteins into the backbone of other viruses"" are used in other scientific methods, such as generating vaccines. ""I wouldn't qualify these ... as gain-of-function, either,"" he said.  
David Relman, a microbiologist at Stanford University, said that the investigators in the paper did not appear to be motivated by the deliberate goal of making a more deadly virus; however, he still viewed the research as ""highly risky."" 
According to Relman, ""the general technique is frequently used and not necessarily problematic. But this particular application of it is problematic,"" because of the distinct possibility that the researchers could have made a virus more dangerous for humans. 
Another point of debate among scientists is whether unusual aspects of the virus leave open the possibility that the virus was artificially manipulated. Scientists have generally agreed that the virus doesn't show clear signs of tampering. However, some argue that extremely competent forms of gain-of-function research wouldn't necessarily leave telltale signs of manipulation, making it hard to rule out the claim that the virus was somehow engineered. 
One strange feature of the virus -- called the furin cleavage site -- has been the focus of lab-leak proponents, including Wade. Gain-of-function researchers have added furin cleavage sites to viruses in the past, and the coronavirus's site is unusual. But Kristian G. Andersen, a microbiologist at the Scripps Research Institute, has pointed out that furin cleavage sites are also found in distantly related coronaviruses.
Petrovsky, the Australian expert, believes that SARS-CoV-2 was unusual among pandemic viruses in that it was ""already very well adapted to human infection and human transmission ... This raised questions of whether this could have happened by rare chance, in an unrecognised host species or whether this adaptation might have occurred due to natural selection or genetic engineering in a laboratory environment.""
Wertheim, on the other hand, told us that the virus's genome doesn't bear any marks of human intervention, genetic manipulation or laboratory passage. ""SARS-CoV-2 was not supremely adapted to humans, (or) guaranteed to cause a pandemic, when it first showed up in Wuhan. In fact, we've seen this virus adapt to infecting and transmission among humans again and again throughout this pandemic.""
Relman offered perhaps the most definitive answer to the question of whether gain-of-function had been performed on the virus:
""I have no idea. Nor does anyone else. We don't have the needed data to be able to say.""
We asked Baric, a professor in epidemiology, microbiology and immunology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a top authority on coronaviruses, about  Paul's characterization of his work during the Senate hearing. Baric's response said that his work involved a very different strain of coronavirus than the one that causes COVID-19, and that the study followed all safety protocols and was considered low risk. 
Fauci told Paul at the hearing: ""Dr. Baric does not do gain-of-function research, and if it is, it's according to the guidelines, and it is being conducted in North Carolina and not China.""
Baric told PolitiFact in a statement that he believed that ""SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic virus that passed from bats to humans based on the primary sequence of the virus, its phylogeny and relationship to other bat strains, historic precedent and it's incredibly complex disease mechanisms. Consequently, I do not believe it was generated from gain of function research, while also noting that many independent research groups have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is distinct from any of the recombinant coronaviruses being studied prior to 2020.""
Baric has said he thought the virus came from bats in southern China, perhaps directly or possibly via an intermediate host, and that he suspected the disease evolved in humans over time without being noticed. Eventually a person carried it to Wuhan ""and the pandemic took off,"" Baric told New York magazine in January. ""Can you rule out a laboratory escape? The answer in this case is probably not.""
Baric, Chan and Relman are among 18 prominent biologists who signed a letter published May 14 in the journal Science stating that ""greater clarity about the origins of this pandemic is necessary and feasible to achieve,"" and that an investigation that considers ""both natural and laboratory spillovers"" should be done.
What we know and don't
Much uncertainty remains about the origins of COVID-19. For those who encounter conspiracy theories about the disease, it's best to keep the following (fairly nuanced) points in mind:  


SARS-CoV-2 was first noticed in Wuhan, close to a lab where bat coronaviruses were being studied and far from the location where naturally occurring relatives of the virus were found. However, there are other plausible explanations of how the virus could have made its way to Wuhan besides a lab leak.


Researchers at the Wuhan lab used reverse genetics on bat coronaviruses to create viruses not found in nature. Some of this research was funded by a grant provided by the National Institutes of Health. However, there's no evidence that this research led to the creation of SARS-CoV-2. 


Scientists who have studied the coronavirus have generally concluded that it resembles naturally occurring viruses. However, we can't completely rule out that the virus was somehow manipulated. Some extremely competent forms of gain-of-function research don't leave signatures or telltale signs of manipulation. 


The early outbreak of the coronavirus was linked to various wildlife markets, which lends support to the claim that the virus jumped from animals to humans. However, scientists haven't yet identified an intermediate host animal that could have incubated the virus before it jumped to humans. 


In any event, none of this amounts to hard proof of either theory. Some scientists have argued that the lab-leak hypothesis deserves to be taken much more seriously than it was earlier in the pandemic, and that dismissals of it as conspiracy theory were premature. Claims of complete certainty on either side remain unfounded.
UPDATE: This report was updated soon after initial publication to include comments from Dr. Ralph Baric.

054.WasaGiantSystemofRoo,"
On 31 July 2017, the Facebook page ""Casper Planet"" posted a message with the claim that the Wyoming State Parks Department had discovered a large network of tree roots beneath the base of Devil's Tower (which, if you have never been, you may recognize from the film Close Encounters of the Third Kind):
<!-


***New Discovery Will Change History***
A huge and startling discovery has been made at the Devils Tower in Wyoming. Scientists from the Wyoming State Parks Department were conducting photographic seismic readings below the tower, when they discovered an incredibly large petrified root system below the tower. The parks department released a statement saying, ""We have discovered, what looks like a giant root system stemming from the base of The Devils Tower. The root system has been measured at 4 miles deep by 7 miles wide. We are currently conducting studies and tests to confirm that this is actually a root system and not a coincidence."" This discovery is on the edge of rewriting history and science as we know it.
We will continue to update you with any new information, as at this time information is very limited.
->
This would be an exciting, landmark discovery ... except that there is absolutely no truth to the claim. The ""Casper Planet"" Facebook page is an entertainment Facebook page that frequently posts photoshopped pictures, political jokes, and other humorous content. 






The ""About"" section of the page clearly says that their content is served with a ""big side order of satire"": 
Delivering the news that doesn't matter directly to your news feed with a big side order of satire!
In this case, ""Casper Planet"" is mocking a conspiracy theory, which springs out of flat-earth theory, holding that most mountains are simply the remains of ancient, gargantuan trees. Although ""Casper Planet"" did include a genuine photograph of Devil's Tower, the pictured root system has little to do with the famous igneous rock formation in Wyoming. The image is actually a diagram showing how the roots of sweet corn have developed after eight weeks:

The original image (right) showed that the roots extended four feet into the ground. It appears that ""Casper Planet"" changed this label to read four miles.
Although geologists are not entirely in agreement about how Devil's Tower was formed, this debate is more focused on the formation process, and less about whether the earth was once populated with atavistic, ten-mile-high trees:
In 1907, scientists Darton and O'Hara decided that Devils Tower must be an eroded remnant of a laccolith. A laccolith is a large, mushroom-shaped mass of igneous rock which intrudes between the layers of sedimentary rocks but does not reach the surface. This produces a rounded bulge in the sedimentary layers above the intrusion. This idea was quite popular in the early 1900s when numerous studies were done on a number of laccoliths in the Southwest.
Other ideas have suggested that Devils Tower is a volcanic plug or that it is the neck of an extinct volcano. Although there is no evidence of volcanic activity -- volcanic ash, lava flows, or volcanic debris - anywhere in the surrounding countryside, it is possible that this material may simply have eroded away.
The simplest explanation is that Devils Tower is a stock -- a small intrusive body formed by magma which cooled underground and was later exposed by erosion.

Wyoming State Parks also addressed the claim in a 1 August 2017 Facebook post:
Wyoming State Parks did not, does not, has not and will not be participating in any kind of scientific study as claimed by this website, which is a fake account and has no basis in reality. Thanks for letting us know this was out there, we'll handle it from here!

278.TopTen911RumorsandCo,"
The 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon were a horrific event that spawned a panoply of rumors and conspiracy theories, perhaps greater in number and scope than those prompted by any other event in human history. On the 14th anniversary of that tragic occurrence, we present a list of the ten most widely circulated entries from our collection of 9/11-related items.

1) False Prophecy
 





 
This claim about French physician and astrologer Nostradamus' supposedly having predicted the September 11 attacks is the granddaddy of all 9/11 rumors, the first one to hit big and go viral, winging its way all over the Internet by the end of that awful day.

2) Daisy Unchained
 
We all wanted to believe in, and be reassured by, the thought of courageous rescuers risking their own lives to gallantly save countless souls from the burning, shattered buildings of the World Trade Center on 9/11. This popular tale of one such putative rescuer by the name of Daisy tugged at heartstrings all the more for featuring a canine hero.

3) This Bud's Not for You 






 
Tales of Arabs living in America supposedly celebrating the 9/11 attacks were legion in the aftermath of September 11, and the ""Budweiser Story"" legend resonated with many people for its plot of a beer distributor striking back against such celebrants.

4) The Accidental Tourist
  






 
For two months after the 9/11 attacks, the Internet was tantalized by an image of a jetliner bearing down on a doomed tourist standing atop a World Trade Center observation deck. Long after the photo was debunked as a digital manipulation, the burning question remained: Just who was the 'tourist guy' pictured in that image?

5) Wingdings
 
One of the more bizarre post-9/11 rumors held that Microsoft's Webdings and Wingdings fonts included hidden anti-Semitic and 9/11-referential messages.

6) Uniform Behavior 






 
Rumors of potential schemes for future terrorist attacks were rampant after 9/11, and one of the most prominent held that a large number of ""missing"" UPS uniforms had been acquired by persons with bad intentions.

7) Atta Boy
 
 
Finger-pointing was a common pastime after 9/11, and one popular partisan political rumor sought to blame either Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan for insisting that Israel release convicted bus bomber Mohammed Atta from life imprisonment, thus freeing him to mastermind the September 11 attacks years later.

8) Oliver Twisted
 
From the ""We should have listened"" file: Popular rumor claimed that back in 1987 Col. Oliver North had warned Congress that Osama bin Laden was ""the most evil person alive"" and advocated his assassination, but Congress didn't heed him. But that wasn't really what he said.

9) Store Honors Islamic Martyr
 
Every September since 2009 has seen the circulation of a signed displayed by Perfume Planet store at the Harwin Central Mart in Houston, Texas, supposedly informing customers that the store would be closed on September 11 to honor one of the terrorists martyred in the 9/11 attacks.

10) Absent Without Leave
 
Many 9/11 conspiracy theories focused on persons or groups who supposedly had foreknowledge of the September 11 attacks. The most prevalent rumor of this ilk held that 4,000 Israelis employed in the World Trade Center all mysteriously stayed home from work on September 11.

41.Licenseddoctorswhosp,"
Earlier this month, Dr. Rashid Buttar posted on Twitter that COVID-19 ""was a planned operation"" and shared an article alleging that most people who got the COVID-19 vaccine would be dead by 2025.
His statement is a recent example in what has been a steady stream of spurious claims surrounding the COVID-19 vaccines and treatments that swirl around the public consciousness. Others include testimony in June by Dr. Sherri Jane Tenpenny before Ohio state legislators that the vaccine could cause people to become magnetized. Clips from the hearing went viral on the internet. On April 9, 2020, Dr. Joseph Mercola posted a video titled, ""Could hydrogen peroxide treat coronavirus?"" which was shared more than 4,600 times. In the video, Mercola said that inhaling hydrogen peroxide through a nebulizer could prevent or cure COVID-19.
These physicians are identified as members of the ""Disinformation Dozen,"" a group of top super-spreaders of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation on social media, according to a 2021 report by the non-profit Center for Countering Digital Hate. The report, based on an analysis of anti-vaccine content on social media platforms, found that 12 people were responsible for 65% of it. The group is composed of physicians, anti-vaccine activists and people known for promoting alternative medicine.
The physician voices are of particular concern because their medical credentials lend credence to their unproven, often dangerous pronouncements. All three continue to hold medical licenses and have not faced consequences for their COVID-related statements.
But leaders of professional medical organizations increasingly are calling for that to change and urging medical oversight boards to take more aggressive action.
In July, the Federation of State Medical Boards, the national umbrella organization for the state-based boards, issued a statement making clear that doctors who generate and spread COVID-19 misinformation could be subject to disciplinary action, including the suspension or revocation of their licenses. The American Board of Family Medicine, American Board of Internal Medicine and American Board of Pediatrics issued a joint statement Sept. 9 in support of the state boards' position, warning  that ""such unethical or unprofessional conduct may prompt their respective Board to take action that could put their certification at risk.""
And the super-spreaders identified by the center's report are not alone. KHN identified 20 other doctors who have made false or misleading claims about COVID-19 by combing through published fact checks and other news coverage.
For example, at an Indiana school board meeting in August, Dr. Dan Stock claimed the recent surge in COVID-19 cases this summer was due to ""antibody mediated viral enhancement"" from people receiving COVID vaccines. PolitiFact rated his claim Pants on Fire false.
Dr. Stella Immanuel, a member of a group America's Frontline Doctors, which has consistently made false statements about COVID-19, said in a video that went viral in July 2020 that masks weren't needed because COVID could be cured by hydroxychloroquine. Immanuel's website currently promotes a set of vitamins, as well as hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, as COVID-19 treatments.
Two of the doctors mentioned by name in this article responded to requests for comment. Mercola offered documents to rebut criticisms of his hydrogen peroxide COVID-19 treatment and took issue with the center's ""disinformation dozen"" report methodology. Buttar defended his positions, saying via email that ""the science is clear and anyone who contests it, has a suspect agenda at best and/or lacks a moral compass."" He also pointed to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Vaccine Adverse Event Recording System, considered by many experts to be inconclusive.
Since the onset of the COVID pandemic, misinformation has been widespread on social media platforms. And many experts blame it for undermining efforts to curb the coronavirus's spread. A recent poll showed that more than 50% of Americans who won't get vaccinated cited conspiracy theories as their reasons-- for example, saying that the vaccines cause infertility or alter DNA.
Some physicians have gained notoriety by embracing COVID-related fringe ideas, quack treatments and falsehoods via social media, conservative talk shows and even in person with patients. Whether promoting the use of ivermectin, an anti-parasitic drug for animals, or a mix of vitamins to treat covid, doctors' words can be especially powerful. Public opinion polls consistently show that Americans have high trust in doctors.
""There is a sense of credibility that comes with being a doctor,"" said Rachel Moran, a researcher who studies COVID-19 misinformation at the University of Washington. ""There is also a sense they have access to insider info that we don't. This is a very confusing time, and it can seem that if anyone knows what I should be doing in this situation, it's a doctor.""
While COVID-19 is a novel and complicated infectious disease, physicians spreading misinformation generally have no particular expertise in infectious diseases. Dr. Scott Atlas, who endorsed former President Donald Trump's unproven statements about the course of the pandemic, is a radiation oncologist.
Traditionally, the responsibility of policing physicians has fallen to state medical boards. Beyond overseeing the licensing process, these panels investigate complaints about doctors and discipline those who engage in unethical, unprofessional or, in extreme cases, criminal activity. Any member of the public can submit a complaint about a physician.
""The boards are relatively slow and weak and it's a long, slow process to pull somebody's license,"" said Arthur Caplan, founding head of the Department of Medical Ethics at New York University. ""In many states, they have their hands full with doctors who have committed felonies, doctors who are molesting their patients. Keeping an eye on misinformation is somewhat down on the priority list.""
To date, only two doctors reportedly faced such sanctions. In Oregon, Dr. Steven LaTulippe had his license suspended in December 2020 for refusing to wear a face mask at his clinic and telling patients that masks were ineffective in curbing the spread of COVID-19, and even dangerous. Dr. Thomas Cowan, a San Francisco physician who posted a YouTube video that went viral in March 2020 stating that 5G networks cause COVID, voluntarily surrendered his medical license to California's medical board in February 2021.
Dr. Humayun Chaudhry, president of the Federation of State Medical Boards, however, said it's possible that some doctors could already be the subject of inquiries and investigations, since these actions are not made public until sanctions are handed down.
KHN reached out to the medical and osteopathic boards of all 50 states and the District of Columbia to see if they had received COVID misinformation complaints. Of the 43 that responded, only a handful shared specifics.
During a one-week period in August, Kansas' medical board received six such complaints. In all, the state has received 35 complaints against 20 licensees about spreading COVID-19 misinformation on social media and in person. In Indiana, the state has received about 30 in the past year. South Carolina said it had about 10 since January 2021. Rhode Island didn't share the number of complaints but said it has taken disciplinary action against one doctor for spreading misinformation, though it hasn't moved to suspend his license. (The disciplinary measures include a fine, a reprimand on the doctor's record and a mandate to complete an ethics course.) Five states said they had received only a couple and 11 states reported receiving zero complaints regarding COVID misinformation.
Confidentiality laws in 13 states prevented those boards from sharing any information regarding complaints.
Social media companies have also been slow to take action. Some doctors' accounts -- specifically those among the Disinformation Dozen -- have been suspended, but others are still active and posting misinformation.
Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said social media platforms often don't consistently apply their rules against spreading misinformation.
""Even when it's the same companies, Facebook will sometimes take posts down, but Instagram will not,"" Ahmed said, referring to Facebook's ownership of Instagram. ""It goes to show their piecemeal, ineffective approach to enforcing their own rules.""
A Facebook spokesperson said the company has removed over 3,000 accounts, pages and groups for repeatedly violating COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation policies since the beginning of the pandemic. Buttar's Facebook and Instagram pages and Tenpenny's Facebook page have been removed, while Mercola's Facebook posts have been demoted, which means that fewer people will see them. Tenpenny and Mercola both still have Instagram accounts.
Part of the challenge may be that these doctors sometimes present scientific opinions that aren't mainstream but are viewed as potentially valid by some of their colleagues.
""It can be difficult to prove that what is being said is outside the range of scientific and medical consensus,"" said Caplan.

042.TweetfromUnitetheRig,"
The issuance of an explosive, late-evening tweet from the account of Jason Kessler, organizer of the ""Unite the Right"" rally that ended in fatal violence one week earlier in Charlottesville, Virginia, has prompted a rare condemnation from the entire length and breadth of the United States political spectrum, from extreme left to extreme right.
The criticism was earned by the nature of its comments directed at Heather Heyer, the counter-protester who was killed in a vehicular attack during the 11 August rally. The tweet (since deleted) went out at 9:25 P.M. on 18 August 2017:

As of this writing, it is still unclear whether Kessler himself actually posted the tweet, which includes a link to the Nazi hate site Daily Stormer, (a source Kessler hadn't typically quoted or referenced in previous tweets, despite his own avowed ""pro-white"" stance). 
A few hours after that tweet appeared, in fact, Daily Stormer owner Andrew Auernheimer (aka ""Weev"") claimed via Gab (another social media platform) that he had hacked Kessler's Twitter account:

In subsequent tweets, Kessler (or whomever was controlling his account) ""repudiated"" the Heather Heyer post, blaming the outburst on stress, drugs, and alcohol:  







Not long afterward, the account was locked, then completely deleted.
The controversy added another layer of intrigue to what appears to be an ongoing effort by Kessler's former alt-right cohorts to isolate and discredit him in the wake of the disastrous Charlottesville event. A conspiracy theory floated by the likes of Alex Jones, Roger Stone, and others attempted to make the case that Kessler was an agent provocateur of the left (or the ""alt-left"") and the violence-plagued rally was a ""false flag"" operation by George Soros and the so-called ""deep state"" to discredit the right and foment social unrest.
Apart from the fact that Kessler was at one time a Barack Obama supporter and evinced a passing interest in the Occupy movement, however, the grounds on which Kessler's detractors have founded their attacks are demonstrably false: Kessler was never an employee of CNN (both CNN and Kessler confirmed this to us), for example, nor did he receive campaign consulting fees from a Democratic Congressional candidate in 2012, nor did he ""suddenly"" convert to an alt-right political stance when President Trump was elected.
The Heather Heyer tweet gave this group a new pretext for disavowing Kessler and pinning the Charlottesville debacle on everyone but the alt-right itself:

152.WatchingtheTVfootageofthosewhoenteredtheCapitolIfyoudidntknowtheTVfootagewasfromJan6youwouldactuallythinkitwasanormaltouristvisit,"
Some Republicans downplayed the violent acts that occurred at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, with one lawmaker comparing the breach to a ""normal tourist visit.""
Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., said there was no insurrection and that the House floor was not breached. Clyde said there was an ""undisciplined mob"" and ""some rioters and some who committed acts of vandalism, but let me be clear: There was no insurrection.""
""Watching the TV footage of those who entered the Capitol and walked through Statuary Hall, showed people in an orderly fashion staying between the stanchions and ropes taking videos and pictures. If you didn't know the TV footage was a video from Jan. 6, you would actually think it was a normal tourist visit,"" Clyde said at a May 12 House hearing.
 

 
Clyde's comparison of the breach of the Capitol to a ""normal tourist visit"" is a ridiculous assertion. 
The Capitol Visitor Center remains closed due to the pandemic, but here is what a normal visit looks like for tourists: They go on guide-led tours of historic areas. They buy souvenirs at the gift shop. They view temporary exhibits. They dine in the restaurant. And they do it all without bringing in weapons (or even water).
Here's what rioters did on Jan. 6. They forced their way through barricades and past law enforcement to breach the building. They smashed windows and broke doors. They ransacked offices. They chanted ""Hang Mike Pence!"" They attacked police officers. They caused the House and Senate to shut down for several hours on the day they were certifying the presidential election. One put his feet up on a desk in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office and left her a nasty note. None of these actions are things that tourists normally do at the Capitol.
Clyde's spokesperson emailed us a video from NBC of people who were walking through Statuary Hall snapping photos or videos at about 2:30 p.m. Jan. 6, shortly after the Capitol was breached. The journalists speaking in the report note that these people had breached the Capitol and hadn't gone through security. 
The fact that people weren't seen committing violence on camera during that particular moment doesn't make it a tourist visit.
More than 400 people have been charged in the riot
A description in one of the charging documents states that at about 2 p.m., people forced their way through, up and over barricades and police officers to advance to the exterior facade of the building. They forced their way into the building by breaking windows and assaulting law enforcement.
The Justice Department has charged more than 400 people in connection with the riot, according to a database by the George Washington University Center on Extremism. Charges include obstruction of law enforcement; violence with a deadly weapon; assault; disorderly conduct; and unlawful possession of firearms.

Says an image shows the Highland Park shooting suspect ""in jail or rehab or a psychiatric center"" before the shooting.












By Bill McCarthy * July 5, 2022







Court documents outlining conspiracy charges show members of the Proud Boys, a far right group, posted messages on social media discussing plans to show up on Jan. 6 ""incognito."" 
Some members of the group were seen wearing earpieces and walkie-talkie style communication devices. Some people at the riot were associated with other extremist or white supremacist groups.
Some of the rioters grabbed a police officer, dragged him and struck him in the head and body with various objects, according to charging documents. Another rioter used a metal flagpole to attack a police officer.
Reports of the number of weapons confiscated are likely an undercount of the weapons people brought to the Capitol. But video shows the mob used makeshift weapons including hockey sticks, flagpoles and a police shield stolen from an officer. The Justice Department's database of charges shows several defendants charged with offenses related to deadly or dangerous weapons, and a few were charged with offenses related to firearm possession.
""Normal Capitol visits don't include individuals armed with zip ties, bear spray, and blunt objects,"" or violent clashes with police, said Michael Jensen, principal investigator at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland. ""Typical Capitol tourists don't smash windows, loot offices, or deface Capitol property. Those types of things happen during insurrections, which is what Jan. 6 was.""
Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, said the criminals who rioted were at the Capitol for purposes far from tourism.
""A tourist is someone who travels for pleasure seeking, cultural interchange or advancement of knowledge about different places and its inhabitants and does not have a political or criminal purpose,"" Levin said. ""The people who rioted included insurrectionists and others who committed federal crimes for a political purpose to obstruct the legal operations of government. I hope people now don't just apply that logic to recast John Wilkes Booth as a theatergoer.""  
Our ruling
Clyde said, ""Watching the TV footage of those who entered the Capitol ... . If you didn't know the TV footage was from Jan. 6, you would actually think it was a normal tourist visit.""
Clyde's spokesperson pointed to a few moments of video of people walking through Statuary Hall snapping photos or videos. But those people were not engaged in anything that resembles tourism. They were part of a group who had violently breached the U.S. Capitol. Rioters that day assaulted police officers and vandalized the building, resulting in more than 400 people charged with crimes. This was no tourist visit, and there was nothing normal about it.
This is a ridiculous statement. Pants on Fire!

13.WasPanAmClipperTaken,"
In the years leading to WWII, as tensions built across the globe, the legacy of the Pan Am Clipper brigade had captured the hearts of aviation enthusiasts worldwide. These novel aircrafts changed American aviation and prompted trans-oceanic voyages. But their existence -- and subsequent disappearances -- have mystified historians for decades. 
Once such mystery is the disappearance of the Hawaii Clipper, a passenger plane that vanished in 1938 during a transpacific voyage from San Francisco, California, to Manila, Philippines. Seven decades later, Snopes readers sent our team the following text, which some said they received in a chain email: 
POSTSCRIPT: Prior to WWII, the Japanese Military became very interested in the new Pratt & Whitney radial engines that powered the PanAm Clipper. On a flight from San Francisco to China, a Clipper landed on Truk Lagoon to be refueled by Japanese authorities. Later, the Clipper was assumed lost over the Pacific. Years later, it was revealed that the crew and passengers were arrested and executed, the engines were retrieved and sent to Japan and the Clipper was sunk in deep water off Truck [sic] Lagoon."" 
The above copy originally appeared in an Aug. 5, 2020, 3DB blog post written by Robert Novell, a former commercial pilot and aviation enthusiast. 
Snopes spoke with Russ Matthews, president of the nonprofit aviation and maritime history organization, Air/Sea Heritage Foundation, who said that the claim above almost certainly is a reference to the Hawaii Clipper, a Martin M-130 that disappeared on the Guam-Manila leg of a transpacific crossing in July 1938. Matthews added that there are many conspiracy theories about the disappearance, but virtually no evidence to back them up.  






""The P&W R-1830 engine had been in production for over five years [at this point],"" said Matthews. ""If the Japanese wanted to study an example, they could have -- and most likely did -- simply buy one."" 
Indeed, a simple Google search confirmed that the Japanese purchased at least 21 samples of the Douglas Company's DC-3 aircraft, which were powered by P&W R-1830 engines. First deliveries were made in December 1937, seven months before the Hawaii Clipper went missing. In February 1938, the Japanese manufacturer Mitsui purchased the production rights and technical data for DC-3, according to The DC-3/Dakota Historical Society, and ultimately built its own version of the DC-3 nicknamed the L2D2 ""Tabby."" 
If Japan had access to both examples of the aircraft and the plans to build it, Matthews argues that it seems implausible the nation would have risked war with the U.S. more than three years before the attack on Pearl Harbor.
The Clipper fleet was nicknamed ""flying boats"" for their ability to land on and take off from the water. The Pan Am Historical Foundation
The Delta Flight Museum notes that Pan American World Airways, what would become known as Pan Am, was at the forefront of international aviation in the 1920s, and by the 1950s, offered"" around the world"" service. The Martin M-130 Clipper fleet, touted as ""flying boats"" for their ability to land and take off from the water, were built for the 3,500-mile journey of transpacific travel to establish new possibilities for commercial aviation and communication by mail. 





 
The Hawaii Clipper departed San Francisco Bay to Manila, requiring 60 hours over six days, with refueling stops in Pearl Harbor, Midway Atoll, Wake Island, and Guam. But after a departure from Guam on July 28, 1938, just before noon local time, it mysteriously disappeared. At the time of its last contact, the aircraft reported flying through layers of clouds and moderately rough air more than 500 miles from the Philippine coast, reported The Associated Press at the time. 
Pan Am's route hopscotched from San Francisco to China by way of islands belonging to the United States. Back then it took a week to fly that far. Today it takes about 10 hours. Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum
""The plane's Flight Radio Officer, William McCarty tapped out a message: 'Standby one minute, having trouble with rain static,'"" wrote The Pan Am Historical Foundation. ""One minute later, when queried by the airline's radio operator on the ground, there was no answer from the clipper. There never would be. The plane had vanished.""
The Hawaii Clipper wasn't the first -- or the last -- that would be lost. Six months prior, the Samoan Clipper disappeared after losing radio contact off the coast of modern-day American Samoa. In the years that followed, the crash of the Philippine Clipper resulted in the death of 19 people in 1943. Two years later, the China Clipper crashed, killing all 23 on board.

Snopes is still fighting an ""infodemic"" of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help. Find out what we've learned and how to inoculate yourself against COVID-19 misinformation. Read the latest fact checks about the vaccines. Submit any questionable rumors and ""advice"" you encounter. Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease.



 







In July 2020, a rumor started to circulate online that typing any three-digit number followed by the words ""new cases"" into Google would return news articles or other reports about COVID-19 in search results. This, according to proponents of this claim, showed that the coronavirus pandemic was nothing more than a conspiracy theory. 

In all honesty, we had trouble following the logic of this false rumor.
Those spreading these ""mind blowing"" search results also appeared a little unsure of what it meant. Most of the posts we encountered did not lay out any specific claims or accusations. Rather, these messages contained vague statements about how the world was being ""played."" As best we can tell, the idea is that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (or, possibly, some shadowy group of elites, George Soros, or another frequently invoked boogeyman) were gaming search results in order to inundate the population with coronavirus content and convince everyone that this ""hoax"" was in fact a real problem. 
There are, of course, a number of problems with this theory. 
Does Googling Any Three-Digit Number Followed by 'New Cases' Return Coronavirus-Related Articles?
Mostly true. We have not typed each of the 900 three-digit numbers (100-999) into Google followed by ""new cases,"" but we did perform a few dozen searches in this manner and in every instance we did get results related to rising COVID-19 cases. For some numbers (typically on the higher range of the three-digit set), Google had to dig back weeks or months in order to find news articles related to the specific search term.  






Is Anything Odd or Unusual About These Search Results?
Not really. Although some may see (or claim to see) these search results as ""mind blowing,"" this actually isn't all that unusual considering the duration (approximately 8 months, as of this writing) and widespread impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Consider this: The first case of COVID-19 in the United States was reported in January 2020. Since then, the disease has spread to all 50 states. In the approximately 200 days between the early COVID-19 cases and this writing, state, local, territorial, academic, and commercial entities have reported case numbers to the CDC. Many cities have also held daily press briefings. In addition to multiple entities recording and reporting on these numbers, there have also been national and local news outlets publishing articles on a daily basis about this data. 
Let's take a look at the math. 
If each of the 50 states issued daily reports about COVID-19 cases for 200 days, that would mean 10,000 reports could contain a three-digit number of COVID-19 cases. There are approximately 19,500 municipal governments in the United States. If every one of those governments reported a daily rise in cases over this 200 days, that's an additional 3,900,000 reports that could contain a three-digit number of COVID-19 cases. If you factor in local and national newspapers and websites (we'll use 13,000, the number of daily newspapers in circulation in 2014; the actual number is likely much higher due to an unknown number of online news websites), that's an additional 2,600,000 reports about COVID-19. 
Even if you reduced the number of possible days from 200 to 120 (lockdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic started in March 2020), that's still millions of daily reports that could possibly show a three-digit rise in case numbers.
It should also be noted that Google can return search results from international organizations, cities, and news outlets. In other words, there are millions of articles and reports that Google can comb through in order to find a result for each of the 900 possible three-digit numbers.
Are These News Reports Manufactured, Doctored, or Inaccurate?
Herein lies an even bigger hole in the conspiracy theory. Out of the dozens of social media posts we encountered from people spreading this rumor, we have not seen anyone correctly claim that the search results provided by Google were inaccurate. Our own searches resulted in genuine news articles from national and local media that cited credible sources.
The fact that searching for any three-digit number followed by the words ""new cases"" results in genuine news articles about COVID-19 does not reveal that the world is being ""played."" Quite the contrary: Testing this ""conspiracy theory"" actually shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is a real and widespread threat. 
Variation of a Theme
This rumor appears to be an offshoot of a similar conspiracy theory that circulated last month. Previously, the word on the internet was that COVID-19 data was suspicious because a number of cities around the world had reported that there had been ""322"" cases or deaths from coronavirus. The fact that multiple locations had reported the same number of cases, according to proponents of this theory, ""proved"" that this pandemic was manufactured.
Again, this is simply a matter of probability. With thousands of cities, states, countries, government organizations, academic institutions, and newspapers around the world reporting daily on COVID-19 cases and deaths, it is inevitable that some numbers are going to be repeated. 
USA Today reported:
The content of the claim is ridiculous, as is the implication there is something shady or manufactured in the way these tallies are reported. The volume of media reports on COVID-19, the number of cases and the number of local and regional units of government means there is ample opportunity for tallies to add up to just about any number, particularly in the low triple digits. Google searches prove out that 322 isn't even a particularly common number.

102.Trumpsfalsehoodsabou,"
President Donald Trump made a series of false attacks on voting by mail at a Nevada rally, wrongly suggesting that Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, is in charge of millions of mail ballots and can ""rig"" the election.
In broad attacks on voting by mail, Trump falsely suggested that mail ballots will only be sent to Democrats. Dead people and dogs will also receive ballots, he said, without providing any details. 

Nevada media outlets reported that thousands of Trump supporters gathered for his outdoor rally Sept. 12 at the Minden-Tahoe Airport, despite state rules limiting gatherings to no more than 50 people. Many in the audience did not wear masks or social distance. Trump was scheduled to hold a rally in Las Vegas on Sept. 13.
We sent emails to the Trump campaign asking for evidence to support his statements about voting by mail in Nevada and did not get a reply by deadline.
Here's a look at six of Trump's false or misleading claims about voting in Nevada:
Says Gov. Sisolak ""is the guy that we're entrusting with millions of ballots, unsolicited ballots, millions and millions.""
Trump is wrong about Sisolak's role in handling mailed ballots. Local elections officials will handle them. Trump also exaggerated the number of Nevada voters.
County election officials will send ballots to every active voter as part of a law passed by the State Assembly. The Trump campaign filed a lawsuit in August challenging AB4.
Sisolak signed the bill in August and rejected a request from Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske to require individuals who return 10 or more ballots on behalf of others to provide their name and political associations. Cegavske, a Republican, opposed AB4.
Nevada has about 1.7 million active voters. (The number will likely be higher by the election.) 
Says Sisolak is ""in charge of the election and the millions of ballots. So if I'm up like millions of votes, he can rig the election, he can rig the election.""
The idea that Sisolak could ""rig"" the election in Nevada is wrong.
The day-to-day tasks of operating an election are in the hands of county officials, not the governor. County election officials send out ballots, recruit poll workers and operate in-person voting sites. The secretary of state supervises state and local elections and certifies election results. 
The secretary of state's office warned that if results change after Election Day, it does not mean there was fraud or malfeasance. The counting of ballots must be done by the ninth day following the election, and county officials have 13 days to certify results.
RELATED: Be patient on election night 2020: Counting the returns will take time
""It's a rigged election. It's the only way we're going to lose."" 
Pants on Fire! Trump is an incumbent facing several ongoing challenges: a major pandemic, high unemployment, civic unrest and future uncertainty. Those are significant political hurdles that would be challenging for any president. 
A conspiracy to rig the results of a national election would require hundreds or thousands of people working together to commit felonies across many jurisdictions. Experts do not consider this feasible, nor do we.
""They send 80 million ballots out. Where are they going? Who are they sending them to? Are they sending them to certain areas and not other areas? Are they sending them to Democrat areas? These are all controlled by Democrat governors, like your politically motivated governor. ""
Trump falsely suggests that mail ballots will be sent only to Democrats. 
Nationwide, ballots will be sent to voters who are Democrats, Republicans, other parties or independents. (Here's the breakdown of the party affiliation of active registered voters in Nevada.) Ballots will be sent in states that have historically sent ballots to all voters for many years predating COVID-19. Some states, including Nevada, decided to send out ballots to all voters this year to reduce the number of voters gathering indoors at voting sites. 
Trump's number of 80 million ballots is likely based on an estimate from the New York Times in August for ballots cast by mail in November.
""They don't even have to have an authorized signature in Nevada. Do you know that? They don't have to have ...You don't have to have an authorized signature on a ballot? No. They're trying to rig an election, and we can't let that happen.""
This is wrong. According to the secretary of state's ""facts vs myths"" for the 2020 general election: ""Signature verification is performed on every ballot received. If the signature is missing or if the signature on the ballot return envelope does not match the signature on file for the voter, the ballot will not be counted until the voter verifies their signature.""
If there is a problem with the signature or its missing, county election officials reach out to voters to offer an opportunity to correct the ballot.
""People died, and they're getting ballots. They're sending them to dogs. You see that? Dogs got ballots.""
We recently fact-checked a misleading claim on Facebook that 200,000 ballots were sent to dead people and pets in Nevada. Around 226,000 ballots for the June 9 primary were returned to Clark County because the voters no longer lived at the address. That doesn't prove they were all dead; it's likely many of them moved since they registered to vote.
The fact that the ballots were returned to the elections office is not evidence of fraud. In fact, it is a sign that the system worked. Postal workers are not allowed to forward ballots if voters have a forwarding address -- they are required to return them. County election officials regularly receive data about deaths that they use to remove dead voters from registration lists.
What about ballots being sent to dogs? 
There have been instances of third-party groups, which use commercial mail lists, of erroneously sending voter registration materials to pets. If people put their pets' names on various mailing lists, it is possible that their pets will wind up with election-related mail. But we've never met a dog or cat that is capable of registering to vote and casting a ballot on their own, so if that were to happen, it would be fraud on the part of a human being.
That's what happened in 2006 in Washington state when Jane Balogh fraudulently registered Duncan, her Australian shepherd terrier-mix. Balogh returned the ballot in her dog's name with an image of a paw print for the signature and wrote ""void"" on the ballot. Balogh said she did it in an effort to point out flaws in the voter registration system. Balogh took a plea deal and agreed to perform community service and pay a fine. Criminal charges were later dropped.
The dog was removed from the voter roll.

68.MyPillowCEOsVideoReh,"



Quick Take
A two-hour video, claiming to prove that the 2020 presidential election was ""stolen"" from former President Donald Trump, has been viewed tens of thousands of times online and aired on the cable channel One America News Network. But the video rehashes baseless conspiracy theories and debunked claims.

Full Story
Three months after Election Day and two weeks after President Joe Biden took office, a video rehashing debunked claims of fraud played repeatedly on the conservative cable station One America News Network.
Mike Lindell -- an avid supporter of former President Donald Trump and CEO of MyPillow, Inc. -- created and presented the video, which reportedly aired with a disclaimer saying that it expressed his ""opinion"" and that he had purchased the airtime starting Feb. 5 and extending through the weekend.
It was viewed tens of thousands of times on social media, including YouTube and Facebook.
The video is titled: ""Absolute Proof."" But Lindell's assertion that the election was ""stolen"" from Trump has no factual basis and many of the claims he relies on in the roughly two-hour video have already been debunked.
Biden won both the Electoral College and the popular vote in an election federal, state and local election officials called ""the most secure in American history."" Then-Attorney General William Barr said there were no signs of fraud on a scale that would have changed the results. A group of 59 election-security experts and computer scientists signed a letter explaining that widespread claims of fraud ""either have been unsubstantiated or are technically incoherent."" Dozens of current and former Republican officials or party brass have publicly rejected the claims. And federal, state, and local courts that have been presented with allegations of fraud have dismissed the suits.
Despite that, the falsehoods persist.
Early in the video, Lindell rattles off a long list of instances of alleged fraud, many of which aren't new.
For example, he claims that there were ""10,315"" cases of dead people voting in Georgia. But Brad Raffensperger, Georgia's secretary of state, told Congress in a Jan. 6 letter that that allegation ""is not supported by any evidence"" and that officials had identified only two potential cases, which were both under investigation at the time.
Lindell also refers to ""100,000"" ballots in Wisconsin being backdated by the U.S. Postal Service. But even if that claim were true, and there is no evidence that it is, it wouldn't have affected election results since all ballots had to be received by Election Day in order to be counted, as USA Today previously explained.
There Was No Cyberattack
A central focus appears to be what he deems ""absolute proof of the biggest cyberattack in history."" But the claim is really just a warmed-over version of a conspiracy theory about a secret supercomputer that we've already addressed.
The theory appeared several days before the election on a dubious blog called the American Report, which claimed that Biden was using a supercomputer called ""Hammer"" and a software program called ""Scorecard"" to ""Steal Another Presidential Election.""
The premise of the theory is that ""Hammer"" and ""Scorecard"" can be used to access electronic voting systems and switch or change votes.
It was elevated to national attention when Sidney Powell, a lawyer who joined Trump's legal team after the election, promoted it on Fox News.
But the bogus theory was directly disputed by federal and state officials, as well as experts who study election security, as we explained at the time.
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency flatly rejected the claim. The agency's director, Chris Krebs -- who was appointed by Trump -- called the theory ""nonsense"" and a ""hoax.""
CISA has said that safeguards -- including auditable logs and software checks -- used by states ensure accuracy in the vote totals.
Still, Lindell invited Mary Fanning, one of the authors of the original American Report post, to present an updated version of the theory on his video.
""This is a documentation, the proof positive"" that foreign governments manipulated the results of the election, she said, while showing a map of the world with lines connecting China, Iran and other countries to the U.S.
Fanning called it ""an act of war to come in and steal the election from the American people.""
She had cited the same map in a Jan. 3 blog post claiming that the originator of the conspiracy theory had ""revealed that there is not just one HAMMER in the United States, but now, also a second HAMMER in the United Kingdom, and also, a third HAMMER in China.""
The theory isn't any more convincing with three supercomputers than it was with one.
Human Error in Antrim County, Michigan
Much of the video also regurgitates claims about Antrim County, Michigan, that stem from an error in the initial, unofficial election results -- which wrongly showed Biden leading Trump in the reliably Republican county. The results were corrected by Nov. 6 and state and local officials have repeatedly explained the mistake as a human error.
Lindell highlights a report that disagreed with that explanation and claimed that Dominion Voting Systems software was designed with errors ""to create systemic fraud and influence election results.""
We wrote about that report in December, when an audit that involved a hand tally of the underlying paper ballots disproved the conspiracy theory. The audit showed a gain of 11 votes for Trump and a loss of one vote for Biden; small variances are expected in a machine versus hand count.
The flawed report was prepared by Allied Security Operations Group, an outfit founded by Russell Ramsland Jr. -- a Republican who unsuccessfully ran for Congress in Texas in 2016 and who has claimed that a ""deep state"" was undermining Trump. Ramsland appears in the video.
Experts told us that among the report's flaws was a calculation of a purported ""error rate"" of 68.05%, which is referenced in the new video, that actually included entries on a log that weren't ""errors"" but standard, expected responses as the tabulators process the paper ballots.

On Jan. 6, 2021, Rosanne Boyland died from what police described as a ""medical emergency"" while she took part in a rally that descended into violent and destructive riots at the U.S. Capitol.
The family and friends of Boyland, 34, from Kennesaw, Georgia, said she had immersed herself in online conspiracy theories in support of outgoing President Donald Trump, and her Facebook page shows she had a preoccupation with debunked allegations that President-elect Joe Biden's election victory was fraudulent or illegitimate. 
On Facebook, Boyland's friend Sarah Lewis paid an emotional tribute to a woman she described as her best friend for more than three decades:
""She had some demons and she had some problems, but she found a purpose in taking care of her little nieces. And she's been good to them and she was real good to my children, and she was real good to me when I needed her. ... I just want to remind everybody she is a human being. She's not a 'psycho Trump supporter,' she's not a drug addict, she's a human being. And she was closer to me than a sister.""
Lewis also issued a warning for others whose loved ones have become embroiled in online conspiracy theories, in the midst of the 2020 presidential election, Trump's defeat, and the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, saying: 






""I hope this is a wake-up call to everybody. Check on your friends. We've all watched her decline and go on these rabbit trails. ... This all really fucked with her head --the QAnon conspiracies, the elections, the unrest, the virus ... ""
In the days following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, and the deaths of five individuals who took part in the events of that day, some online observers highlighted a detail taken from a photograph of Boyland at the rally, and a description of the events leading up to her death.
On Jan. 7, Atlanta CBS affiliate WGCL broadcast an interview with Justin Winchell, a friend of Boyland's who travelled with her from Georgia to Washington, D.C., to attend Trump's ""Save America"" rally at the Ellipse, next to the White House, before moving to Capitol Hill, where the demonstration turned violent. 
The interview can be viewed below. The following is a transcript of Winchell's description of the moments leading up to Boyland's death, and reporter Zac Summers's narration:
Winchell: They basically created a panic, people created a panic. And the police, in turn, pushed back on them.
Summers: Winchell says the trouble started when a couple of guys started pushing people. The crowd then clashed with police, trampling over one another, sending 34-year-old Boyland to the ground.
Winchell: I got my arm underneath her, and I was pulling her out, pulling her out, and then another guy fell on top of her, and then another guy was just walking. I mean, there was people crushed. 
Summers: Winchell says paramedics tried reviving his friend, but she died. 





The WGCL report included what appeared to be a photograph of Boyland at the Jan. 6 rally, carrying what is known as a Gadsden flag -- a yellow and black design containing a coiled snake and the warning ""Don't Tread On Me."" Over the years, the Gadsden flag has been displayed and used in a variety of contexts, some of them innocuous, but it has recently become closely associated with right-wing militias and supporters of Trump. 
To some online observers, those details created a degree of irony in the circumstances surrounding Boyland's demise -- namely that she was, according to Winchell's description, trampled to death after having carried a flag that read ""Don't tread on me."" 






We are issuing a rating of ""Mostly True"" as to those core claims. Boyland did undoubtedly carry a Gadsden flag to the Trump rally, and, based on video footage and witness reports, she was trampled before later dying in a hospital. However, it's not yet clear whether the injuries she sustained by being trampled were what caused her death, or if her death was caused by something else, such as a medical emergency, which might also have prompted her to fall to the ground. 
This fact check was updated, and the rating changed from ""Mixture"" to ""Mostly True,"" after The New York Times published a detailed analysis of video footage from the riot, which demonstrated that Boyland was indeed trampled. 
The photograph included in WGCL's report is authentic. It was tweeted out by Summers on Jan. 7 and can be viewed below:

In an email, Summers confirmed for Snopes that Winchell provided him that photograph, and that it was indeed taken during the events of Jan. 6. This part of the claim -- that Boyland carried and displayed a Gadsden flag with the words ""Don't tread on me"" on the day of the riots -- was accurate.
We attempted to verify Winchell's description of the events leading up to Boyland's death. On Jan. 7, the District of Columbia Police Department (DCPD) listed her as one of the individuals who had died during the events of the previous day, writing on Twitter that she had suffered a ""medical emergency.""
Snopes asked DCPD for further details, and a department spokesperson provided a brief incident report, which can be read in full here. (In light of reports of harassment and intimidation against various individuals even tangentially involved in the events of Jan. 6, Snopes has, on this occasion, redacted the names of DCPD personnel).
The report states that DCPD were called to the Capitol on the evening of Jan. 6 after receiving a report that Boyland ""was witnessed to collapse"" during the riot around 5 p.m. and was suffering a ""medical emergency."" Upon arrival, DCPD found two U.S. Capitol Police officers giving her CPR inside the Capitol Rotunda. 






The DCPD officers took over and then transported Boyland to a local hospital, where she was pronounced dead at 6:09 p.m. 
Snopes could find no evidence that an autopsy has been performed, so the DCPD incident report is, at time of writing, the only official account of Boyland's death. It does not corroborate Winchell's claim that she died as a result of being trampled, and instead states that she had ""collapsed.""
However, on Jan. 15, 2021, The New York Times published a report which included additional witness testimony and, crucially, video footage that corroborated Winchell's account. The Times supplemented that video evidence with an additional report, published on Jan. 28, which contained footage recorded by the bodyworn camera of a Metropolitan Police officer on the scene at that time. 
Taken together, those witness descriptions and video evidence constitute convincing proof that Boyland was indeed trampled under foot during the riot. 
However, it remains possible that Boyland collapsed independently and was subsequently struck by others while on the ground. In the absence of an autopsy report, which would likely clarify the precise cause and manner of Boyland's death, we can't say with certainty that she was ""trampled to death,"" though we do now have confirmation that she was trampled. As a result, we are issuing a rating of ""Mostly True.""

84.WasaMyLittlePonyAnim,"
On 31 July 2018, the Ottawa Citizen reported that Tom Wysom, an animator for several children's cartoon series including My Little Pony, had been sentenced to more than two years in prison after pleading guilty to charges associated with possession of child pornography:

Tom Wysom, 55, has worked on TV productions such as My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and Littlest Pet Shop, according to the Internet Movie Database.
Wysom was sentenced earlier this month after pleading guilty to the charges in December, two months after police executed a search warrant at his home in Old Ottawa South.
Police found 60,165 pictures -- many of them duplicates -- along with 1,626 videos, some of which depicted adults engaging in sexual behaviours with children. In some of the images, young girls had their hands and feet bound.
Although this part of the story, reported by a legitimate news source citing court records, is true, the case prompted backers of popular conspiracy theory known as ""QAnon"" to link it with ""#PedoGate,"" a viral phenomenon and outgrowth of PizzaGate -- a belief that powerful Democrats and Hollywood ""elites"" were running a pedophile ring out of a Washington, D.C., pizza parlor basement (even though the restaurant, Comet Ping Pong, has no basement):

ANIMATOR OF ""My Little Pony"" TOM WYSOM, HOLLYWEIRD #pedophile RECIVES MILD SENTENCE FOR OVER 3,000 IMAGES OF CHILDREN, SOME WITH HANDS AND FEET TIED! #SICK #pedogate #hollywoodConnectionpedophiles #Qanon #MAGA @POTUS @SenTedCruz @MAGA_POTUS45 @1776Stonewall @seanhannity @RandPaul
-- Rita Williams  (@RitaWil92435229) July 30, 2018
 






""Qanon"" conspiracy theory enthusiasts believe that a highly-placed government agent who goes by the moniker ""Q"" is dropping ""crumbs"" of information for his followers (""bakers"") to pick up. As Dutch psychologist and researcher Jan-Willem van Prooijen described the phenomenon:
If it sounds crazy, that's because it is. The mostly right-wing conspiracy theory makes a series of mind-blowing allegations that include Democrat-run centers for pedophiles and Satanic cults. The theory first appeared on various online message boards like ""8Chan,"" where followers shared ""bread crumbs"" -- clues -- about the dark and powerful forces that supposedly run their country.
According to RationalWiki, the conspiracy is often referred to as ""The Storm"" because President Trump made a vague reference to ""the calm before the storm"" in 2017:
The Storm's central premise is that President Trump is secretly working to take down a global ring of elite, cannibalistic, satanic pedophiles. And the investigation into Russian meddling into the 2016 election, led by former FBI director Robert Mueller, is actually an investigation into the so-called ""deep state"", where a cabal of evil, money-grubbing globalists, including Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, are responsible for everything from a global pedophile ring to the mass shooting in Las Vegas in 2017.
Despite sounding ""crazy,"" the QAnon conspiracy has grown in influence, becoming most obvious to outsiders when supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump began sporting ""Q"" tee shirts en masse at Trump rallies. The Guardian referred to it as a ""volatile mix of Pizzagate, InfoWars and the Satanic Panic of the 1980s, multiplied by the power of the internet and with an extra boost from a handful of conservative celebrities.""
Internet users along with disreputable web sites often either fabricate pedophilia claims involving celebrities and prominent Democrats or lump real cases of criminal activity in with the conspiracy, despite lacking evidence of a link. Wysom's case falls into the latter category.
The idea that Wysom's case was somehow associated with the #PedoGate conspiracy theory was helped along by followers of media personalities who heavily promoted PizzaGate, such as alt-right social media character Jack Posobiec and Alex Jones's conspiracy network InfoWars, which republished (then deleted) the Ottawa Citizen report:

But #PedoGate......that's just a conspiracy, right? ??

23.WasGinaHaspelFoundDe,"
In November 2020, rumors circulated about the whereabouts of CIA Director Gina Haspel. An article reproduced on the conspiratorial Rumor Mill News, for example, claimed that Haspel was arrested for treason. Others claimed that Haspel had been found dead from natural causes. 

Both of these rumors are unsubstantiated and are built upon a debunked conspiracy theory about a fictional raid on an election software company in Germany.
In the days following the 2020 election, the internet was flooded with conspiracy theories that falsely claimed the election was rigged or fraudulent in some manner. One of the more outlandish theories held that an election software company in Germany had been used to alter the vote tallies in the United States.
This theory reached a wide audience after Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas said during a Zoom call that U.S. Army forces had seized servers from the software company Scytl in Frankfurt, Germany. Gohmert also said that his information was based on a tweet and that he did not know the truth, yet conspiracy theorists picked up this thread and ran with it.  






On Nov. 15, 2020, The Associated Press published an article investigating the rumor, which they determined to be false:
CLAIM: The U.S. Army raided the Frankfurt office of the Spanish election software company Scytl to seize servers that had evidence of voting irregularities in the Nov. 3 U.S. election.
AP'S ASSESSMENT: False. Both the Army and Scytl told The Associated Press the claim is not true. Furthermore, Scytl does not have offices or servers in Frankfurt, Germany.
THE FACTS: Social media users Saturday were sharing reports published by conservative websites claiming servers that would reveal wrongdoing in the U.S. election had been confiscated by U.S. military forces in Germany. Most posts said the servers belong to the software company Scytl, which is based in Barcelona, and some suggested the servers housed information from Dominion Voting Systems.
Although this raid did not happen, that didn't stop conspiracy theorists. 
On Nov. 29, Rumor Mill News reproduced an article (it's not entirely clear where the article originated, but it appears to come from a ""Q drop"" -- an unsourced rumor penned by a person cosplaying as a government official) claiming that Haspel had been severely injured during this raid and that she was then airlifted to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp (GITMO) where she was arrested for treason.  
That article, which misspells Haspel's name numerous times, reads in part:
CIA Director Gina Hasple was arrested after she was injured in the Frankfurt Germany CIA building raid to secure the servers.
The building had no guards and was unprotected. Hasple pulled in some private special military trained security forces to protect the building from such a suspected raid. When the raid happened Hasple was there...
...The CIA made up a cover story about the 5 soldiers and one cia operative killed and said they were killed in a helicopter crash.
Hasple was air evacuated out. She was flown to GITMO where she was treated and received a tribunal for treason. She agreed to help trump for a lighter sentence of life which can be revoked if she chooses to not cooperate. She has now turned over information on the servers, what they were for and what they did and who was involved.
Shortly after this article was published, another rumor started to circulate about Haspel claiming that the CIA director had been ""found dead"" of ""natural causes,"" which led to speculation that the government had actually killed Haspel and that they were now covering up her death. 
Some social media users also came across an alleged obituary for Haspel. This obituary, however, was not published by a credible national news organization, or even the local newspaper of Haspel's hometown in Ashland, Kentucky. Rather, this ""obituary"" -- which simply took the aforementioned conspiratorial postings as truth and provided no additional confirmation -- was published on Dec. 1 on deaddeath.com, a website that has previously published premature obituaries based on fake news. For example, they wrote an obituary for ""Carolyn Gombell,"" a non-existent woman featured in a fictional story about U.S. President Donald Trump being a murderer.
These rumors about Haspel's death did not originate with credible sources and no evidence has been provided to support them. These rumors stem from a debunked story about a fictional raid on a German software company. As such, we've marked this rumor as ""False.""

110.COVID19vaccinescontainRNAmodifyingtranshumanismnanotechnology,"
A headline on a video widely shared on Facebook used multisyllabic words to make an alarming claim about the COVID-19 vaccines:
""Dr. Carrie Madej: Why Is RNA-Modifying Transhumanism-Nano-Technology Inside the COVID-19 Vaccines?""
The short answer to the question: It isn't. The vaccines don't contain any such thing.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
It's part of a baseless conspiracy theory about the vaccines being part of an effort to change humans through technology.
""None of the vaccines contain nanotechnology of any sort, let alone 'transhumanism nanotechnology,' which isn't even a thing,"" said Mark Lynas, a visiting fellow at the Alliance for Science and Cornell University. 
Planning to 'evolve humanity'
Madej describes herself as an osteopathic internal medicine doctor who stands for ""freedom, truth, great love,"" and who is ""practicing the truth in Jesus through medicine."" She also indicates she is no longer practicing medicine, but rather ""dedicates her time to educating others on vaccines, nanotechnology and human rights.""
Madej has made multiple claims about the COVID-19 vaccines that fact-checkers have rated false.
In the 50-minute video, Madej described attending business owner meetings in metropolitan Atlanta several years ago in which the participants discussed ""transhumanism,"" which she said is ""taking the human body and making it better"" through methods such as ""genetic modification, nanotechnology, melding the human body with artificial intelligence."" 
The COVID-19 vaccines, she suggested, are part of this effort.
""The people that are pushing these agendas"" are also ""pushing these injections on everybody around the world. They go hand in hand,"" she said. Their plan ""is to change what it is to be human, and their goal is 2030.""
Madej said she viewed the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines with a compound microscope and observed indications of ""superconducting materials,"" or a ""liquified computing system."" 
She also said she observed ""tentacle-like, spider-like organisms,"" and that people told her they were pond-water parasites.
We rated as Pants on Fire claims that the Pfizer vaccine contains ""a deadly parasite"" and ""living particles"" that could germinate in the body.

According to International Olympic Committee data, ""an average of 29 athletes under the age of 35 suffered sudden death per year from 1966 to 2004. From March 2021 to March 2022, 769 athletes have died or suffered cardiac arrest.""












By Samantha Putterman * June 23, 2022







We can't say what Madej was looking at under a microscope or what she saw. We messaged Madej on Facebook, but did not get a reply. Madej does not list contact information on her website or on her Instagram, Facebook and Twitter accounts. We called two phone numbers listed online for her; neither were working.
A jumble of scientific terms
The only links between Madej's description of the vaccine and what's actually in it are the term ""RNA"" and the prefix ""nano.""
RNA -- ribonucleic acid -- is a molecule similar to DNA that carries coded genetic information to a cell. The Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines use a form called messenger RNA, or mRNA, to carry genetic information about the coronavirus to the body's cells to teach the immune system to identify and prepare to fight off a COVID-19 infection. It does not modify a person's DNA or RNA. 
The mRNA technology dates to the 1990s, though this is the first time it has been used in widely disseminated vaccines. 
The Johnson & Johnson vaccine does not use mRNA. Instead, it uses a disabled adenovirus to deliver instructions to help the body recognize the coronavirus' spike proteins and activate the immune system. 
Lynas at Cornell said mRNA vaccines ""have proven incredibly safe and effective and the technology is also looking promising for many other diseases and cancer.""
Nanoparticles are not nanotechnology
The term ""nano"" is widely used to describe things that are very small, such as iPods and cars, but scientists use the prefix more specifically to refer to things on the scale of individual atoms. 
Nanotechnology, says the National Nanotechnology Initiative, is the ""application of extremely small things"" for uses in fields such as chemistry, biology and physics. These can be structures or even tiny machines. 
In the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, the mRNA is contained in a ""lipid bubble,"" or a shell of fat, that's described as a nanoparticle. That just means it's very small. That doesn't make it nanotechnology. 
""Even though the term is used here to imply that nanotechnology is being used to modify your RNA, that is completely false,"" said Cindy Prins, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida. ""The mRNA in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines doesn't have any effect on one's DNA or RNA. It doesn't become a permanent part of the cell.""
Prins said Madej's explanation of what she says she observed ""is ridiculous. She says she is using a compound microscope, which can be used to look at cells or bacteria, but certainly will not show nano-scale structures.""
Translating 'transhumanism'
Transhumanism is the belief in changing and enhancing the human body through technology.  
Lynas said ""there are people who believe we should try to transcend human biology and upload human consciousness to computers -- but they are a fairly marginal group and don't have anything to do with vaccine developers, in my knowledge.""
Prins said: ""I have been vaccinated and can guarantee that the only modification I have is immunity to COVID-19.""
Our ruling
Madej said the COVID-19 vaccines contain ""RNA-modifying transhumanism nanotechnology.""
There is no evidence that the three vaccines used in the U.S. contain any such thing. Two of the vaccines use mRNA technology that does not change the body's DNA or RNA or alter humans permanently.
The claim is false and ridiculous -- Pants on Fire!

Most conspiracy theories surrounding President John F. Kennedy's assassination have been disproven. Kennedy was not killed by a gas-powered device triggered by aliens or by actor Woody Harrelson's dad.
But speculation about Kennedy's Nov. 22, 1963 murder in Dallas continues, fueled by unreleased classified documents, bizarre ballistics and the claim of assassin Lee Harvey Oswald - who was later killed on live TV while in police custody - that he was ""just a patsy."" 






Several JFK assassination experts, like the former New York Times investigative reporter Phillip Shenon, see Mexico as the best place to find answers regarding a possible conspiracy and who was behind it. 


Oswald's Mexico visa from 1963, with entry and exit stamps.
Mexican Secretary of the Interior


Just over a month before Kennedy's killing, Oswald took a bus from Texas to Mexico City. He arrived Friday morning, Sept. 27, 1963 and left very early on Wednesday, Oct. 2, according to American and Mexican intelligence.
Was Oswald a kind of rogue James Bond who went south of the border to consort with communists, Cuban revolutionaries and spies - or just a deranged killer?
I dug into that question while researching my book on conspiracy narratives in Mexico, and I think I found something everybody else missed: a hole in the story of the very man who started a tenacious conspiracy theory about Oswald's Mexico trip.
Communist Mexico City
Mexico was a Cold War hot spot in the mid-20th century, a haven for Soviet exiles, American leftists fleeing the anti-communist persecution of McCarthyism and sympathizers with Cuba's Castro regime. Every communist and democratic country had an embassy in Mexico City - the only place in the Western Hemisphere where these enemies coexisted more or less openly.

According to witnesses from the Cuban and Soviet diplomatic missions, Oswald visited their embassies repeatedly on Friday and Saturday. He was desperately seeking visas to those countries, which Americans were then prohibited from visiting. 
Told such documents would take months to process, Oswald got in a heated argument with the Cuban consul, Emilio Azcue. Oswald also forced a KGB volleyball match on Saturday morning to be canceled when he brandished a weapon at the Soviet consulate, before bursting into tears and leaving. 
Those events are well documented by the CIA, which in the 1960s had ramped up its Mexico operations to monitor communist activity, even hiring 200 Mexican agents to help. The Mexican Secret Service, whose 1960s-era files Mexico has recently begun to declassify, also tracked Oswald on Sept. 27 and Sept. 28, 1963. 
Oswald's whereabouts for the next three-and-a-half days, however, remain unknown.

A conspiracy theory is born
A main conspiracy about Oswald's undocumented time in Mexico City puts him in contact with dangerous Mexicans on the left side of the Cold War. 
This story originated in March 1967, when the American consul in the Mexican coastal city of Tampico, Benjamin Ruyle, was buying drinks for local journalists.
One of them - Oscar Contreras Lartigue, a 28-year-old reporter for El Sol de Tampico - told Ruyle he'd met Oswald in 1963 when he was a law student at Mexico's National Autonomous University. 
Contreras said he'd been in a pro-Castro campus group and that Oswald had begged this group for help getting a Cuban visa. According to Contreras, Oswald spent two days with these National Autonomous University students, then met up with them again a few days later at the Cuban Embassy. 
Evidently afraid for his life, Contreras wouldn't tell Ruyle much more. He said he himself had traveled to Cuba, knew people in the Castro regime and had blown up the statue of a former Mexican president on campus in Mexico City. Contreras feared persecution for his political activities.  






Contreras did say this wasn't the first time he was sharing his story, though. After JFK was shot, Contreras told Ruyle, he'd commented to his editor that he'd recently met Oswald. 
The Contreras question
Contreras' account hinted at suspicious, previously unknown connections between Oswald and communist Cuba made shortly before JFK's assassination.
His story was, according to a memo later sent from CIA headquarters, ""the first solid investigative lead we have on Oswald's activities in Mexico."" U.S. government officials needed to find out if Contreras was a trustworthy source.

Three months after Ruyle's happy hour, a CIA official from Mexico City went to Tampico to question Contreras. During the six-hour interrogation, Contreras still refused to go into details, but he did say Oswald never mentioned assassination - only that he said repeatedly he ""had to get to Cuba.""
In 1978, a researcher from the U.S. House Select Commission on Assassinations named Dan Hardway went to Mexico to investigate the JFK assassination. He was unable to interview Contreras despite several attempts, but in an influential report warned his account should not be dismissed.  
The New York Times reporter Shenon, who interviewed Oscar Contreras for a 2013 book on the JFK assassination, also found Contreras credible. Shenon wrote that Contreras - whom he calls a ""prominent journalist"" - ""went much further"" in their interview than he had with the CIA, alleging ""far more extensive contacts between Oswald and Cuban agents in Mexico.""
Dan Hardway, who is now a lawyer in West Virginia, still believes Contreras. After reading Shenon's book, he reiterated in 2015 that Lee Harvey Oswald might have been part of a wider Cuban intelligence web. 
Hole in the web
Oscar Contreras died in 2016, so I could not interview him myself. 
But in my investigation, a minute detail of his biography grabbed my attention - an apparently overlooked contradiction that could undermine his entire story. 


A 1963 'Sol de Tampico' column by Contreras.


In Contreras' telling, he fled the National Autonomous University campus and moved to Tampico around 1964. Yet Contreras also allegedly told his ""editor"" about his encounter with Oswald after the 1963 Kennedy assassination. 
College newspapers aren't common in Mexico, and Contreras was a law student. So how could he have had an editor in 1963? 
I thought his hometown paper, El Sol de Tampico, might hold the answer. Digging through its archives, I found that the newspaper ran a Sunday gossip column in the early 1960s called ""Crisol,"" or ""melting pot."" 
Oscar Contreras became the reporter for ""Crisol"" on June 6, 1963, and continued writing the gossip column in September and October that year. 
While Lee Harvey Oswald was in Mexico City, Contreras was 300 miles away in Tampico. In flamboyant prose, faded back issues of the local paper show, he chronicled the sumptuous wedding receptions, quinceaneras and yacht excursions of Tampico's high society. 
Three dark days
I believe the Sol de Tampico archives discredit Contereras' account. 


Contreras wrote for Sol de Tampico on Oct. 6, 1963.
Sol de Tampico


A political correspondent may live far from where his newspaper is published. But for a gossip columnist, that would be dereliction of duty. 
This revelation plunges Oswald's fall 1963 trip to Mexico back into the dark. 
There are other conspiracy theories, including that Oswald had a Mexican mistress who took him to a party of communists and spies. 
But it's more likely Mexico holds no hidden clues to JFK's assassination. 
Conspiracy theories offer assurances of depth and closure, a promise that the biggest enigma of the 20th century is solvable. But from what we know about what Oswald did and didn't do in Mexico City, he was a volatile, disorganized loner who couldn't even handle travel logistics. 
JFK's assassination is a cold case. And in Mexico, only exhausted leads remain.

146.SaysthePentagonkilledamanwhoinventedawaterpoweredfuelcellforcars,"
A decades-old conspiracy theory claiming the Pentagon assassinated an Ohio inventor resurfaced recently thanks to a widely circulating Facebook post.
The May 25 post includes a nearly one-minute video showing a man reacting to an old news broadcast from the now-defunct WTVN-TV in Columbus, Ohio. The broadcast is a segment on a local man named Stanley Meyer showing off what he claimed was a water-powered car that he invented.
""Imagine if we all had water powered cars,"" the caption on the post says. ""Pentagon killed this man.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The post alludes to the theory that Meyer's death in 1998 was due not to natural causes but to an assassination by the government to suppress his invention. But there's no evidence of that.
In the credulous WTVN broadcast, a reporter said an official from the Pentagon had visited Meyer to check on his invention. That statement has helped fuel suspicions that the government had something to do with his death. 
In an email to PolitiFact, a Pentagon spokesperson said the agency doesn't have any information on Meyer or his death. 
Meyer's concept would have defied laws of physics
Meyer was an inventor with no formal scientific background who claimed to have developed a ""water fuel cell"" that could be used instead of gasoline to power a car.
The fuel cell purportedly worked by breaking down the water into hydrogen and oxygen, and using the hydrogen to power the car. Meyer claimed during the broadcast his fuel cell could run on ""rain water, well water, city water, ocean water.""
However, it was unclear how his fuel cell would be able to split the water into its component elements, as Meyer also claimed the process required a fraction of the energy it would normally take to break down water into hydrogen and oxygen.

Such a technology would have had to to defy the first and second laws of thermodynamics in order to work, according to Nature magazine, which dismissed the idea of water as fuel as a long-running myth. Energy cannot be created or destroyed and, when energy is transformed from one form to another, its final state cannot be greater than its initial state, unless energy is added to the system. (Some newly developed electric vehicles use a hydrogen-powered fuel cell to produce electricity, and emit only water vapor.)
Meyer claimed that the U.S. government was interested in his water fuel cell. His twin brother, Stephen, reported that he and Meyer were dining with potential foreign investors at a Cracker Barrel in Ohio on March 20, 1998, when Stanley Meyer suddenly felt a jolt of pain in his neck, according to the Columbus Dispatch. As Stanley Meyer rushed out of the restaurant, he told his brother ""they poisoned me"" and, once outside, fell to the ground and died at the age of 57.
Long investigation
Because of the suddenness of his death and Meyer's dying declaration, the police investigation into the incident took three months, according to the paper. However, no evidence of foul play was ever discovered.
The Franklin County coroner's office determined Meyer had high blood pressure and died of a brain aneurysm, the Dispatch reported. The only drugs found in his system were lidocaine and phenytoin -- seizure medication.
High blood pressure is one of the risk factors associated with a brain aneurysm, according to the Mayo Clinic. Symptoms of an aneurysm include a sudden headache, stiff neck, vomiting and seizures.
The coroner's report obtained by the Dispatch initially described Meyer's dining companions as officers from NATO. One of the investors with Meyer at the time of his death, Philippe Vandemoortele, told a Netherlands blog in 2020 that he doesn't know why he was identified as a NATO officer or how rumors that Meyer had been deliberately killed started.  
""I have some doubts about whether his death happened by chance, but I know nothing more than anyone else,"" he told the blog. ""What is certain is that I didn't kill him, he was my friend and I even paid his bills the week before.""
Our ruling
A Facebook post said Stanley Meyer, a man who claimed to have invented a water-powered car, was killed by the Pentagon.
Meyer claimed he was poisoned moments before he died in 1998, fueling speculation that his death was suspicious. But a police investigation found no evidence of foul play, and his death was ruled the result of a brain aneurysm brought on in part by high blood pressure.
We rate this claim False.

Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.
In an ongoing campaign to sow doubt about the validity of the 2020 presidential election, hardcore supporters of outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump and related QAnon conspiracy theorists have suggested a corrupt connection between U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr and the company Dominion Voting Systems. Dominion has been a subject of myriad debunked conspiracy theories regarding ""flipped votes,"" and in late November 2020 Barr became the target of Trumpist scorn after he stated he had seen no evidence of widespread voter fraud:

The allegation is that Barr was appointed to serve on, and currently is a member of, the board of directors for Dominion. This is flawed for several reasons, but a fairly central problem is that a news release that accompanied the above tweet refers to the Virginia-based Energy behemoth Dominion Energy Services, Inc., which has nothing whatsoever to do with the company Dominion Voting Services.
It is true that Barr was elected to serve on the board of directors of Dominion Energy. This occurred over a decade ago, in December 2009. In February 2019, when Barr was confirmed as Trump's attorney general, he resigned that position, as noted in a company news release:
The company ... announced the resignation from the board of William P. Barr, effective Feb. 12, 2019. Barr was nominated by President Donald Trump in December to be U.S. Attorney General, and he was confirmed today. Barr joined Dominion Energy's board in 2009 and chaired the Compensation, Governance and Nominating Committee at the time of his resignation.
It is not true, however, that Dominion Energy is related to Dominion Voting. An attempt at making this connection focused on the false assertion that Dominion Voting Services is or was one of the ""over 240"" subsidiaries of Dominion Energy. Indeed, Dominion Energy, Inc. owns several subsidiaries, but Dominion Voting Services -- or any election-related company -- is not one of them, according to their most recent SEC filings.
As there is no connection outside of the shared use of the word ""Dominion"" in their company's name, there is also no connection -- even an out-of-date one -- between Barr and Dominion Voting Systems. The claim therefore is ""False.""

This article is republished here with permission from The Conversation. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.

Debate has grown in recent years over the role that social media algorithms play in spreading conspiracy theories and extreme political content online. YouTube's recommender algorithm has come under particularly severe scrutiny. A number of exposes have detailed how it can take viewers down a radicalisation rabbit hole.
While YouTube has certainly extended the reach of conspiracy theorists, it's difficult to assess the objective role of algorithms in these radicalisation processes. But my own research has observed the way certain radical communities which congregate at the fringes of the web have managed to essentially manufacture conspiracy theories. These have, in turn, trended on social media.
In 2019, YouTube dramatically cleaned up its platform after coming under pressure from journalists. It removed lucrative ad revenue and deleted entire channels - most notoriously the Infowars channel of the US talk-radio host Alex Jones. 






While a recent research paper on this topic noted a corresponding overall decrease in conspiracy theory videos on YouTube, it also observed that the platform continued to recommend conspiratorial videos to viewers who had previously consumed such material. The findings indicate that plenty of potentially objectionable content remains on YouTube. However, they don't necessarily support the argument that viewers are guided by algorithms down rabbit holes of ever-more conspiratorial content.
By contrast, another recent study of YouTube's recommender algorithm found that conspiracy channels seemed to gain ""zero traffic from recommendations"". While this particular study's methodology generated some debate back and forth, the fact is that an accurate understanding of how these social media algorithms work is impossible. Their inner workings are a corporate secret known only to a few - and possibly even to no humans at all because the underlying mechanisms are so complex.
Not just cultural dopes
The presumption that audiences are the passive recipients of media messages - that they are ""cultural dopes"" easily subject to subliminal manipulation - has a long popular history in the field of media and communications studies. It's an argument that's often popped up in conservative reactions to heavy metal music and video game violence.
But by focusing on audiences as active participants rather than passive recipients we arguably gain greater insights into the complex media ecosystem within which conspiracy theories develop and propagate online. Often these move from the subcultural fringes of the deep web to a more mainstream audience.
Conspiracy theories are an increasingly important method of indoctrination and extremist radicalisation. At the same time, their adversarial logic also maps onto a populist style of political rhetoric that pits the general will of the people against a corrupt and ageing establishment elite.
A much more extreme version of this dynamic is also characteristic of right-wing anger against the perceived dominance of a ""globalist liberal elite"". Such anger galvanised parts of the trolling subculture associated with certain forums, message boards and microblogging social networks, in support of the presidential candidacy of Donald Trump.
A common rhetorical technique used on the far-right political discussion forum of the anonymous message board 4chan has been to lump together all manifestations of this liberal, globalist elite into a singular nebulous ""other"". Whether a perfidious individual, a shadowy organisation, or a suspect way of thinking, this conspiracy is imagined as something which undermines the interests of the ultra-nationalist community. These interests also tend to coincide with those of Trump as well as of the white race in general. 






This far-right online community has an established record of propagating hatred, and it has also produced two extremely bizarre and extremely successful pro-Trump conspiracy theories: Pizzagate and QAnon.
Pizzagate
Unlike the black boxes of corporate social media algorithms, 4chan datasets are easily captured and analysed, which has allowed us to study these conspiracy theories in order to identify the processes that brought them about. In both cases these conspiracy theories can be understood as the product of collective labour by amateur researchers congregating within these fringe communities who build up a theory by a process of referencing and citation.
Pizzagate was a bizarre theory connecting the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton to a child sex ring supposedly run out of a pizza parlour in Washington DC. It developed on 4chan in the course of a single day, shortly before the November 2016 US election. What made Pizzagate new and unusual was how it seemed to emerge from the fringes of the web, at a safe distance from Trump's own campaign.
Algorithms surely did play a part in spreading #Pizzagate. But more crucial to legitimising it was the way elements of the story filtered through popular social media channels on Twitter and YouTube, including the Infowars channel of Alex Jones
QAnon
A year later, at the outset of the investigation by Robert Mueller into alleged Russian collusion in the Trump campaign, a new conspiracy theory once again emerged from 4chan. It reworked some elements of the Pizzagate narrative and combined it together with ""deep state"" conspiracy theories. What would in time simply become known as QAnon initially grew from a series of 4chan posts by a supposed government official with ""Q level"" security clearance.

Often referred to by readers as ""breadcrumbs"", these posts tended to simply ask open ended questions - such as ""who controls the narrative?"" ""what is a map?"" and ""why is this relevant?"". Like medieval scholars engaged in interpretation of metaphysical texts, readers have constructed elaborate illuminated manuscripts and narrative compilations. One of these is currently an Amazon #1 bestseller in the category of ""censorship"".
The message here is that by focusing on the role of algorithms in amplifying the reach of conspiracy theories, we should be careful not to fall back on a patronising framework that imagines people as passive relays rather than active audiences engaged in their own kind of research which propagates radically alternative interpretations of events.
The theory that social media algorithms lure people into conspiracy theories is difficult to definitively prove. But what's clear is that a conspiratorial subculture with roots extending into the deep web now increasingly appears just below the surface of average people's seemingly ""normal"" media consumption. In the end, the real problem is less one of manipulation by algorithms than of political polarisation.

34.ProoftheWhiteHelmets,"
A volunteer group of search and rescue workers called the Syria Civil Defense group -- better known as the White Helmets -- is frequently subjected to unfounded conspiracy theories, such as the claim that the group ""stages"" various acts of violence using ""crisis actors.""
These accusations were superficially bolstered by a set of images which purportedly showed the group staging a chemical attack in Douma, Syria in April 2018. Dean McGonigle, a congressional candidate running for Nevada District 4, helped promote this theory:

Here's a better look at the images involved in this rumor:
 






Although these images do feature actors, they are not of the ""crisis"" variety. These photographs were taken on the set of the Syrian movie ""fylm rjl lthwr@"" or Revolution Man, and they have been on the Internet since at least 24 February 2018 (more than a month before the alleged chemical attack in Douma) when they were posted to the movie's Facebook page.
The belief that the White Helmets or similar groups are staging chemical attacks in Syria is not one exclusively held by conspiracy theorists or the uninformed. It is parroting Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad's line that crisis actors were used to stage a terrorist attack in April 2017 and claims that a photograph of a young child in the aftermath of an airstrike on Aleppo had been forged. Assad's regime also denied using chemical weapons in Douma. 
Revolution Man pushes a similar idea. A news report from Sana about the premiere of the film, which was supported by the Syrian Cultural Ministry, explained that the movie is about a photojournalist who resorts to staging a chemical attack in an effort to win a Pulitzer Prize after he sneaks into Syria to take photographs of the war:

The film revolves around a journalist who enters Syria illegally in order to take pictures and videos of the war in Syria in search of fame and international prizes, and after failing to reach his goal, he resorts to helping the terrorists to fabricate an incident using chemical materials, with the aim of turning his photos into a global event.
In other words, photographs from a film set about a man staging a chemical attack are being used by conspiracy theorists (and Russian state media) as evidence that a chemical attack was actually staged. (Although the controversial film does acknowledge that chemical attacks take place in Syria, it places the blame on foreigners and activist groups -- such as the White Helmets.)
Another set of images frequently associated with the claim that the White Helmets were caught staging a chemical attack also made their way around the internet after the incident in Douma:

These images have been online since 2016, and show members of the White Helmets filming a ""mannequin challenge"" video. A spokesperson for the group told the BBC that the video was never officially sanctioned and that the members demonstrated poor judgement and opened the group up to criticism:
 ""The video and the related posts were recorded by RFS media with Syria Civil Defence (White Helmets) volunteers, who hoped to create a connection between the horror of Syria and the outside world, using the viral Mannequin Challenge,"" the statement read.
""This was an error of judgement, and we apologise on behalf of the volunteers involved.
""The video was not shared on our official channels, and we took immediate action to discipline those involved and prevent incidents such as this from happening again.
""Our volunteers are committed to saving lives by responding to, and reporting, war crimes in Syria.
""This leaves us open to attacks, not just from the bombs but from those who seek to silence us for telling the truth.""

42.ForeignProTrumpFaceb,"
A network of Facebook pages managed from Bulgaria, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, is pushing hundreds of videos of primetime opinion shows from Fox News, One America News Network (OAN), and Newsmax. The majority of the videos have been posted with altered thumbnails and lower-third headlines, presenting the misleading idea that the conservative personalities on the shows reported that U.S. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi were going to jail. Both are Democrats.
These doctored photographs of Biden, Pelosi, and McConnell in jail were not aired by Fox News. The lower-third headlines were also doctored.
Some of the thumbnails featured U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Republican, perhaps because, as USA Today reported, he ""rebuked"" the attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. In the months before and after Election Day, a number of his Republican colleagues latched onto baseless conspiracy theories about voter fraud, an apparent attempt to please constituents who had been influenced by lies on talk radio, cable news, and social media.
We uncovered pages named TopCulinaria aka @top1newsusa, Receitas Top 10, Receitinhas da Vovo aka @Newstodaytrump, Red Bird Farm, Paige 10, darwin05cantillo24 aka @TrumpDaily2024, DannLu, RT HyLele, Em 16+, Thalia Fans Bulgaria, and three groups named We Love Breaking News America, Trump Daily Report, and US News Daily. According to Google Translate, one of the pages had a Russian-language name: Gibelna krasota / Bella Calamidades.
Facebook's ""Page Transparency"" tool showed a mix of countries where the pages are purportedly managed, including Bulgaria, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. While there may be other countries involved in the network, we were unable to find sufficient evidence of more than the five mentioned. 






In addition to altering the thumbnails and lower-third headlines to make it appear as if Biden and Pelosi were going to jail, many of the thumbnails have falsely claimed that former President Donald Trump was coming back to be president in 2021. However, that is not possible. The next U.S. presidential election is not until 2024.
Trump is not coming back to be the president in 2021.
The clips posted to the pages feature full-length shows from the networks and received at least tens of millions of views over the course of nearly a year, beginning in late 2020. The total follower count for the pages numbered well over 260,000 Facebook users.
The pages posted full-length episodes of ""The Ingraham Angle,"" ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" ""Hannity,"" ""Justice with Judge Jeanine,"" ""The Five,"" ""Greg Kelly Reports,"" ""OAN Morning News,"" ""Watters' World,"" ""Stinchfield,"" and ""Life, Liberty and Levin.""
The website associated with the pages and groups was trumpdailyreport.com. According to the website's registration information, the domain was first created on May 26, 2021, purportedly from Da Nang, Vietnam. According to Da Nang Today, the city has recently been dealing with troubles involving COVID-19 misinformation on social media, even going as far as to fine citizens found to be pushing such misleading content. In 2019, we reported about an enormous pro-Trump network known as ""The BL,"" which had 55 million followers, spent $9.5 million in Facebook ads, and was largely managed from Vietnam. Our reporting, along with an investigation by Lead Stories reporter Sarah Thompson, led to perhaps one of the largest network removals in Facebook history. ""The BL"" is closely linked to The Epoch Times.
We also noticed that one of the pages listed a phone number with a country code for Colombia: +57.
Several of the pages that have pushed the altered pro-Trump videos appeared to have been created years earlier, back when they promoted the Spanish-language telenovela ""Bella Calamidades,"" which translates to ""Beautiful But Unlucky."" Screenshots from the television show were uploaded to the pages in 2013. We also found evidence that TopCulinaria aka @top1newsusa used to be a page about food.
The page may have been compromised by bad actors. 






In addition to the new videos, some of the pages also posted memes about Trump.
This meme was posted by the Gibelna krasota / Bella Calamidades Facebook page to the group We Love Breaking News America, where it received at least 16,000 shares.
It's unclear if there were more pages and groups in the same network, or if their reach extended to other social media platforms. Administrators in the groups included the names Rex Avelliano, Hafiz Melana, and Marleny Ordonez Martinez. The groups were created by an account named Rb Parroco Obejas.
On Aug. 26, within mere minutes of our team finding the We Love Breaking News America Facebook group and beginning our investigation, it disappeared, despite the fact that it had been around for some time. Some of the pages also soon disappeared from Facebook, or so we thought. In reality, the web addresses had simply changed by the page managers, but the pages were still available. All of the pages and the two other groups were still active days after we published this story.
In the days and weeks before this story was published, we reported about how Tina Forte, a Republican running against U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in 2022, was at the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, and also heavily promoted the date beforehand on Facebook and Twitter. She even livestreamed on Facebook Live that day.
We also detailed in two other recent stories about how QAnon content and COVID denialism are thriving on Facebook. In our report about COVID denialism, we detailed how an anti-mask and anti-vaccine Facebook group was pushing sales of fake masks for use in schools. More than two weeks later, as the United States is once again seeing thousands of COVID deaths per day, as children are returning to school in states across the country, and amid skyrocketing case numbers in kids, the fake masks posts are still visible and the Facebook group is still active and thriving on the social media platform.
This story will be updated should any new information come to light.

75.DidPastorRickWilesCa,"
In late 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about reports that Rick Wiles, a controversial right-wing pastor, had launched a virulently anti-Semitic attack on leading congressional Democrats, claiming that impeachment proceedings against U.S. President Donald Trump amounted to a ""Jew coup.""
Such reports were published by the Times of Israel, and the websites BoingBoing.net and RightWingWatch.org, among others. 
Those articles were accurate. On Nov. 22, Wiles dedicated an entire 97-minute episode on his online channel TruNews to what the episode billed as ""Jew Coup: Seditious Jews Orchestrating Trump Impeachment Lynching.""
What Wiles said
 






Wiles has repeatedly indulged and promoted anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and tropes on his channel, as documented by the Anti-Defamation League. The president's son, Donald Trump Jr., drew criticism in March for agreeing to be interviewed by TruNews, despite its record of promoting conspiracy theories and inflammatory misinformation, and the channel has been given access to White House press conferences, and been allowed to put questions to President Trump. 
In his Nov. 22 episode, Wiles continued that pattern of anti-Semitic attacks on perceived opponents of Trump, hitting on virtually every age-old myth and trope about Jewish people and targeting named, individual members of Congress, deploying false, outrageous, and at times downright bizarre slurs against them. 
The episode was removed by YouTube for violating its rules on hate speech, but as of Nov. 27, the video remained on the TruNews website and Facebook page, and was still available through iTunes as an audio-only podcast. This fact check contains, by necessity, virulently anti-Semitic language that some readers might find offensive. 
Towards the beginning of the episode, Wiles set out his thesis statement:
""The 'Impeach Trump' movement is a Jew coup, plain and simple. The men and women who are the driving forces to remove Donald J. Trump from the White House are Jews. America is in the throes of a political coup led by Jews. President Trump is surrounded by a rabid pack of seditious, treacherous Jews who are intent on overthrowing the votes of millions of Christians who elected him in 2016.""
At several points, Wiles used language that suggested civil war was inevitable in the United States, as a result of the fictional ""Jew coup,"" and in one instance appeared to encourage a violent ""backlash"" against a non-existent Jewish plan to ""kill millions of Christians.""
In one instance, his co-host Doc Burkhart parsed a campaign ad by U.S. Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va., suggesting that a reference in the ad to ""all enemies, foreign and domestic"" (from the congressional oath of office) meant she was accusing Trump of being such a domestic enemy. Wiles shot back ""I consider these Jews to be domestic enemies! These are seditious, treacherous Jews who are undermining the president of the United States and pushing this country to civil war.""
He later mused: ""This country could be in civil war at Christmas time. Members of the U.S. military are going to have to take a stand, just like they did in the 1860s with the Civil War ... People are going to be forced, possibly by this Christmas, to take a stand, because of this Jew coup in the United States. We have weeks to stop it."" 






Towards the end of the broadcast, Wiles urged his viewers: ""There is going to be a backlash. If there isn't a backlash, the country is over, you have been taken over by a Jewish cabal, a Bolshevik revolution ... Get it through your head! They're coming for you! There will be a purge, that's the next thing that happens when Jews take over a country -- they kill millions of Christians!""
Wiles labeled Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a ""lying, Jewish congressman,"" adding: ""That's the way the Jews work. They are deceivers, they plot, they lie, they do whatever they have to do to accomplish their political agenda.""
Wiles parroted Trump's epithet of choice for the influential chair of the House intelligence committee, calling him ""Shifty Schiff"" and launching a bizarre, personal attack on him:
""His eyes -- he freaks me out, Doc, there's something wrong with that man. Seriously, mentally there's something mentally wrong with that man ... He looks demon-possessed. Honestly, Adam Schiff looks like a mental psycho. He creeps me out.""
Wiles then deployed yet another age-old calumny against Jewish people, implying that Schiff's true loyalties did not lie with the United States: ""And he's chairman of the House intelligence committee? Oh boy, I wonder how much intelligence is flowing to Israel.""
The Florida-based pastor labeled Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union and a key witness in impeachment hearings, a ""treacherous, lying, deceiving Jewish operative."" On more than one occasion, Wiles likened Jews to animals and carriers of disease -- a notorious, anti-Semitic rhetorical device that was used most damagingly during the rise to power of the Nazis in 1930s Germany.
He said the list of participants and witnesses involved in the Ukrainian controversy, which has been a key focus of impeachment hearings so far, was ""infested with Jews"" (Congress is investigating whether Trump asked Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and family in exchange for military aid). Wiles also claimed that a group of ""treacherous, seditious Jews"" were ""surrounding the president like a pack of wolves."" He described Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, another key witness in the impeachment hearings and a Purple Heart recipient, as a ""treacherous snake.""
The depths of anti-Semitism to which the program sank was perhaps best summed up in a moment when Burkhart referred to the ""Protocols of the Elders of Zion,"" an early 20th century fabricated document that purported to be a record of a Jewish conspiracy for global domination, but was later definitively shown to be a hoax.
""Protocols"" is a quintessential example of deliberately inflammatory, anti-Semitic disinformation, and was widely deployed by the Nazis as propaganda in order to vindicate the annihilation of the Jewish people. Burkhart mused: ""Some say it's fake, I believe there's a lot of truth to it."" Wiles added: ""Whoever wrote it back in the 1800s, they accurately predicted what was going to happen in the world.""

64.GeorgeSorosConspirac,"

They say he hires protesters and rents buses to transport them. Some say he has people stash piles of bricks to be hurled into glass storefronts or at police.
George Soros, the billionaire investor and philanthropist who has long been a target of conspiracy theories, is now being falsely accused of orchestrating and funding the protests over police killings of Black people that have roiled the United States. Amplified by a growing number of people on the far right, including some Republican leaders, online posts about Soros have skyrocketed in recent weeks.
They have been accompanied by online ads bought by conservative groups that call on authorities to ""investigate George Soros for funding domestic terrorism and his decades-long corruption.""
Soros, 89, has donated billions of dollars of his personal wealth to liberal and anti-authoritarian causes around the world, making him a favored target among many on the right. The Hungarian-American, who is Jewish, has also been the subject of anti-Semitic attacks and conspiracy theories for decades.
Such hoaxes can now travel farther and faster with social media. 






Over just four days in late May, negative Twitter posts about Soros spiked from about 20,000 a day to more than 500,000 a day, according to an analysis by the Anti-Defamation League.
The Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a London think tank focused on extremism and polarization, found an even more pronounced jump on Facebook, where there were 68,746 mentions of Soros in May. The previous record of 38,326 Soros mentions was in October 2018, when angry posts alleged he was helping migrant caravans headed to the U.S.
The new wave began as nationwide demonstrations emerged over George Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police. Some insist Soros financed the protests, while others say he colluded with police to fake Floyd's death last month. But all available evidence suggests the protests are what they seem: gatherings of thousands of Americans upset about police brutality and racial injustice.
""I think partly it's an attempt to distract from the real matters at hand -- the pandemic, the protests or the Black Lives Matter movement,"" Laura Silber, chief communications officer for Soros' philanthropic Open Society Foundations, said of the theories. ""It's pretty demeaning to the people out there protesting when someone says they're all paid. It's insulting.""
A look at some of the claims:
-- Soros pays protesters. No evidence has been presented to suggest demonstrators were paid by Soros or his organizations. It's a new take on an old hoax: past versions claimed Soros paid for a long list of other events, including the 2017 Women's March held just after President Donald Trump's inauguration.
-- Soros pays to transport protesters. Last week, a photo claiming to show two buses emblazoned with the words ""Soros Riot Dance Squad"" got widespread attention. The photo was cited as proof of Soros' involvement in the protests, but it was bogus. The original photo showed two unmarked buses; someone later doctored it to add the language supposedly implicating Soros.
-- Soros organizes stashing piles of bricks near protests. Several false claims involving stockpiles of bricks have been debunked, and no evidence has turned up showing they were purposefully placed. 






Experts who study conspiracy theories say the new claims about Soros are a way to delegitimize the protests and the actual reasons behind them. Some see anti-Semitism, or a new spin on the age-old hoax that a shadowy cabal of rich men -- whether it's the Illuminati, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, Bill Gates or Soros -- is manipulating world events.
The theories have had real-world consequences. In 2018, amid news of caravans of migrants making their way toward the U.S.-Mexico border, online misinformation about Soros was linked to violence. Cesar Sayoc, a Florida man who was obsessed with Trump, mentioned Soros dozens of times on social media before mailing pipe bombs to newsrooms, top Democrats and Soros himself.
Despite significant scrutiny, no evidence was ever found to tie the caravan to Soros. Trump, however, helped fan the flames when asked whether Soros was involved.
""I wouldn't be surprised. A lot of people say yes,"" the president said.
Still, some Republicans have begun pushing back on false claims of Soros' connection to the protests and those spreading the rumors. After several Republican Party chairpeople in a Texas county shared posts claiming Soros was behind the demonstrations, the state party leader called on them to resign.
Experts say conspiracy theories can become a problem when they lead to threats of violence or cause people to lose trust in important institutions. They can fade into the background only to reemerge at times of crisis.
""Conspiracy theories are like themselves viruses,"" said Josh Introne, a Syracuse University information studies professor who researches conspiracy theories. ""The characters may change a little, and the theory itself may mutate. But they stick around.""

On Jan. 6, 2021, supporters of outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump violently converged on the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. in support of Trump's false claims that the November 2020 presidential election was beset by massive scale voter fraud that led to his loss.
Trump supporters at the Capitol brawled with police and broke through barricades, eventually breaking into the building while Congress was in the process of counting electoral college votes and confirming President-elect Joe Biden's win.
Some on social media started spreading unfounded rumors that the violent chaos was being instigated not by Trump supporters, but by anti-fascist activists, colloquially known by the portmanteau antifa.
There is no evidence that the mob storming Capitol grounds and violently engaging police are antifa -- in fact the social media accounts spreading the rumor are followers of the QAnon conspiracy theory. Here is one example of one such tweet, which reads, ""BREAKING: PATRIOTS ARE NOT STORMING ANYTHING!! PAID FOR ANTIFA DOES, PERIOD!!"":
 






It was Trump himself who encouraged his supporters to march to the Capitol, as CNN White House reporter Kevin Liptak reported:

To recap, Trump told his supporters he would march with them down Penn. Ave to the Capitol.
He drove back in his SUV to the White House.
His supporters went to the Capitol and have now breached the building.
-- Kevin Liptak (@Kevinliptakcnn) January 6, 2021

Shortly after, his supporters took him at his word and marched to the Capitol, breached the building, and as of this writing, were inside.

Mob has burst into U.S. House Chamber, with protesters crying that Trump won the election.@igorbobic pic.twitter.com/u5OxwGo0sJ
-- Michael Beschloss (@BeschlossDC) January 6, 2021

Members of the right wing extremist group Proud Boys, which is known for provoking violence and brawling, have also boasted in discussions leading up to the attack on the Capitol that they would forego their ""uniform"" -- which consists of black and yellow -- in favor of all-black garb. When they do show up at protests, antifa activists typically wear all black.
Qanon followers have been deemed a potential violent threat by the FBI. Here is how we previously reported on the Qanon belief system:
In general, QAnon believes Trump is in the middle of a biblical war against a ""deep state,"" satanic cabal of baby-eating, child sex-traffickers led by prominent members of the Democratic party, entertainers who espouse liberal opinions, anybody who mentions ""pizza,"" and authoritative sources who relay credible information that may cast a negative light on the president. Proponents of this theory believe that one day soon the ""storm"" will come and Trump, with the help of an anonymous high-ranking military official known as ""Q,"" will round up members of the deep state, arrest them, and possibly have them executed. 






Based on the fact that the sources of this rumor are unreliable, and the fact that Trump urged his supporters to do exactly what they're doing now, and that an extremist group known for provoking violence stated that it had planned to dress in black to ""blend in,"" we rate this rumor ""False.""
In the days following the attack on the Capitol, wrenching scenes of police officers battered by the mob drew public outrage. Right wing figures on social media continued to push the baseless narrative in an attempt to blame left wing activists associated with antifa and the Black Lives Matter civil rights movement for the violence. Five people were killed, including a Capitol police officer, and dozens of outnumbered police were injured, many of whom fought hand-to-hand with rioters in an effort to prevent them from breaching the building.
Some right wing figures pointed to John Sullivan, an accused agent provocateur who filmed the death of Ashli Babbitt, an Air Force veteran and Trump supporter who was shot by police when she tried to break through a barricaded door as rioters broke into the building. Sullivan was arrested in Utah on Jan. 14, 2021, on charges related to the riot.
For example, right wing junk site Gateway Pundit's headline reported, ""BREAKING: FBI Arrests Antifa Leader John Sullivan in Utah After Storming US Capitol ...Update: With FBI Affidavit."" The story was tweeted by ""Happy Days"" actor and Trump supporter Scott Baio. The unfounded claim has even been embraced by some members of Congress, including U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Alabama, who has come under fire for an incendiary speech at a rally that preceded the mob attack on the Capitol.
But Sullivan, a Utah resident, isn't an ""antifa leader,"" and the idea that he's part of the Black Lives Matter movement was rejected by the local chapter in his home state, as The Intercept's Robert Mackey noted in a detailed analysis:
""In fact, Sullivan is a curious figure who is treated with suspicion or outright hostility by a number of left-wing organizers associated with Black Lives Matter and antifascism in Utah, California and the Pacific Northwest.""
Mackey went on to report that left wing activists in various cities have warned against associating with Sullivan, accusing him of harmful actions and exploiting protests movements for personal gain.
The FBI said during a Jan. 8, 2021, news conference that there was ""no indication"" that anyone from the antifa movement was involved in the attack. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican who has been an outspoken Trump supporter, bluntly rejected the claim that the riot was instigated by left wing activists, stating, ""Some say the riots were caused by antifa. There is absolutely no evidence of that. And conservatives should be the first to say so.""

183.CloudsOverGenevaShow,"
A dramatic series of photographs of a thunderstorm over Geneva were reappropriated in order to peddle the claim that they are evidence that the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva was responsible for opening portals to other dimensions.
The images, which were taken by photographer Christophe Suarez and posted to his social media accounts, including Flickr and Twitter, were taken without his permission and without attribution:

Friday night, a small supercell takes shape over #Geneva - Naissance d'une supercellule au dessus de #Geneve #Storm pic.twitter.com/Ac56pzbAJi
-- Christophe Suarez (@suarezphoto) June 26, 2016

One such conspiracy theory-pushing outfit runs a YouTube page called ""Freedom Fighter Times,"" and in a 27 June 2016 post, claimed that Suarez's pictures depicted a ""ball of energy"" located directly over the LHC. Suarez responded angrily on his Facebook page, both to having his photographs lifted without attribution and to the fact they were appropriated by conspiracy theorists, saying in French that there were storms throughout Switzerland the night the pictures were taken (24 June 2016) and that the weather patterns had been predicted by Swiss meteorologists. 






Suarez told us he and two friends were chasing the storm as it swept over Geneva, trying to capture the cloud formations and lightning. He reiterated his frustration over having his photographs published without his permission in a message to us, and also expressed dismay over the purpose they were used for:
With the culture of digital photography and photos with smartphones, it is common to think that a photo has no value. I work with a photo agency located in the south of France, and I've seen the prices fall the last 15 years. The photographer is not recognized nowadays... Actually, the behavior of some media, agreeing to work with photo microstock agencies or even asking photographers to work for free, and worse, sometimes stealing the photos, is unacceptable. And in fact, that's what happened with our photos of the Geneva thunderstorm. They were stolen to demonstrate stupid theories.
Suarez also told French-language magazine Le Dauphine that the pictures weren't even taken over CERN, ""but a little further on the Geneva basin."" Suarez also tweeted, ""I don't allow anyone, person or entity, (newspaper, TV, blog, etc.) to publish a picture posted on my wall, without my permission.""
But Suarez' condemnations could not stop multiple web sites from taking his photographs and using them alongside the story line that CERN created an interdimensional ""portal."" One headline reads, ""What is CERN doing? Bizarre clouds over Large Hadron Collider 'prove portals are opening.'"" Yet another reads, ""Is THIS the portal to another dimension? Bizarre clouds spotted over Hadron Collider."" The stories appear mainly in tabloids and web sites with names like ""Ancient Code"" and ""Prophecy News Watch.""
The narrator of the Freedom Fighter Times video says he can see a face in the cloud and angrily notes:
It's amazing, because they keep messing with nature and denying it, and here is yet more proof that they are messing with nature... Now is it a coincidence that they just started their Awake experiment?""
Later, after determining the picture wasn't faked, the narrator says:
What portals are being opened in this cloud?... Now of course somebody's gonna call me crazy or a conspiracy theorist. That's OK, that's great. But you know what, when you actually come to the chance of where you're gonna awaken to these crazy experiments that CERN is doing, you have to realize that people have filed lawsuits against CERN. 






He then shows another photograph of what he says is the same area, this time with a rainbow arched over it, and goes on to warn that rainbows are a reminder that God will flood the planet if people don't repent from their sins. According to CERN's web site for the AWAKE experiment, it is the first accelerator of its kind to test plasma wakefield acceleration:
A plasma wakefield is a type of wave generated by particles travelling through a plasma. AWAKE will send proton beams through plasma cells to generate these fields. By harnessing wakefields, physicists may be able to produce accelerator gradients hundreds of times higher than those achieved in current radiofrequency cavities. This would allow future colliders to achieve higher energies over shorter distances than is possible today.
CERN sits on the French-Swiss border in Switzerland and houses the world's largest particle collider -- a machine that allows scientists to test an array of theories in particle physics. Perhaps because experiments conducted at CERN carry the promise of answering large, fundamental questions about space, time and the nature of physical existence, as well as ringing in a new era of scientific accomplishments, it has been a focal point of conspiracy theorists who fear it will be a launchpad for a doomsday scenario.

27.NoDefenseSecretaryLl,"
In late January 2021, readers sent Snopes a meme circulating on Facebook that was mocked up to look like a screenshot of part of a news article that falsely reported newly confirmed U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin planned on ""defunding, maybe disbanding"" the Army, and relying on China to provide national defense.

This is not a screenshot of a real news article. Rather, it appears to be an altered image spread around Facebook for the purpose of sharing misinformation. The screenshot included the byline of Joe Gould, a reporter for the military-oriented news website and magazine Defense News. No such article penned by Gould or any other reputable journalist exists.
Austin was confirmed as the first Black secretary of defense by an overwhelming, bipartisan vote in the U.S. Senate on Jan. 22, 2021, with 93 Republican and Democratic senators affirming his position. It is hard to imagine Austin would have gained such resounding support from members of the Senate from both parties had he proposed such an outlandish policy as replacing a branch of the U.S. military with Chinese forces.
During his confirmation hearing, Austin talked about maintaining the American military's strategic advantage over, and countering any potential threat posed by, China.
It appears that the meme is meant to exploit racist and xenophobic sentiments by using the term ""defund"" in reference to the military to falsely link Austin's leadership with unrelated Black Lives Matter protests over the spring and summer of 2020. During those protests, activists participating in civil rights demonstrations against police killings of Black Americans had called for defunding of police departments.
It also leverages baseless conspiracy theories about links between U.S. President Joe Biden and China, which were promoted by Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump.

""Dr. Drew"" Pinsky, the addiction specialist with a decades-long career in radio and television, will be leaving HLN in September.
CNN executive vice president Ken Jautz confirmed the move in a statement:
Dr. Drew and his team have delivered more than five years of creative shows and I want to thank them for their hard work and distinctive programming.
Their audience-driven shows, in particular, were innovative and memorable TV. And Dr. Drew has been an authoritative voice on addiction and on many other topical issues facing America today.
Conspiracy theories abounded about the ending of Pinsky's show on HLN, mostly around the timing of the announcement (which came just several days after he offered opinions about the health of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton),
despite the fact that he will be staying on with CNN as a contributor:
I'm sure this had nothing to do with video of Dr. Drew talking about Hillary's health racking up over 600,000 views on YouTube and causing a major disruption for the Hillary campaign!
However, nobody seemed as concerned about a potential conspiracy when Nancy Grace announced that her show on HLN was also ending after twelve years on the air:
""This fall, I'll be leaving HLN, my longtime TV home, with a full heart and endless gratitude,"" Grace said in a statement Thursday. ""The network has been my extended family for nearly a dozen years, and I am proud of the amazing work we've produced together.""
HLN is phasing in more news and commentary as it continues to focus more on current events.  The network said that Pinsky's show, ""Dr. Drew on Call,"" will be replaced by CNN anchor and host Ashleigh Banfield.

73.DidaDemocraticCongre,"
During his 2018 State of the Union address, as Donald Trump talked about monuments -- to freedom, to historical figures, and to veterans -- Republicans started chanting ""USA!"" As they did so, about three minutes before the end of the speech, Democratic Congressman Luis Gutierrez gathered up his things and walked out of the room -- a move that has put him at the center of a storm of outrage. 
Fox News, in a piece headlined ""Democrat Luis Gutierrez Storms Out of State of the Union During 'USA' Chant"" said:
Rep. Luis Gutierrez turned and left the State of the Union address Tuesday, just as Republicans broke into a ""USA"" chant. President Donald Trump had just finished mentioning the Statue of Freedom atop the Capitol building, which he then called a ""monument to the American people.""
In that section of remarks, Trump also praised veterans in wars from the Revolution, through World War II and today, mentioning sites like Saratoga, N.Y., Yorktown, V.A. and the Pacific theater.
As half of the gallery broke into a ""USA"" chant, Gutierrez (D-Ill.) could be seen exiting his aisle seat and walking out of the chamber.
Paul Joseph Watson, editor-at-large of the conspiracy theory web site Infowars claimed Gutierrez left because he was ""triggered"" by the chanting. 
Speaking to Fox News, Deputy White House Press Secretary J. Hogan Gidley responded to the Congressman's early departure from the speech, saying ""For the life of me I can't figure out when Democrats became so...anti-this country."" 






In reality, Gutierrez has dismissed these claims, saying he left the chamber in order to make it to a television interview on time, adding that he deliberately waited until the president had stopped speaking before leaving his seat.

There is a story going around that I ""stormed out"" of the President's speech last night which is completely false. That I boycotted the speech or protested by leaving during an applause break is just someone's spin.
-- Luis V. Gutierrez (@RepGutierrez) January 31, 2018
 

I was due on TV for an interview and the speech was running late. I waited until the President stopped talking and walked to the back and watched the last 90-seconds on TV (after sitting for 80 minutes). Then went to my interview. Those are the facts. https://t.co/Gq3oKwTe1O
-- Luis V. Gutierrez (@RepGutierrez) January 31, 2018

Gutierrez can be seen leaving his seat at the 1:17:22 mark in this footage, during an applause break about three minutes before the end of the speech. 
CNN/YouTube
However, Gutierrez can also be seen preparing to leave his seat (at 1:17:15) before the chants of ""U.S.A.!"" began (1:17:19.). 






CNN/YouTube
This undermines claims that Gutierrez was leaving in response to the chants. The sequence of events can be clearly seen in this short clip from the longer CNN video:

We have a bipartisan standing ovation -- and a lot of ""USA!"" chants. https://t.co/00Kmhu7ges
-- Meg Wagner (@megwagner) January 31, 2018

The Congressman's contention that the speech was ""running late"" is also a reasonable one. At one hour and 20 minutes, Trump's was the third-longest State of the Union speech in more than 50 years, according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California Santa Barbara.
After the speech ended, Gutierrez conducted an interview with Univision. His Twitter account posted this photo at 10.43pm -- six minutes after the president left the chamber. You can watch an excerpt of the interview (in Spanish) here.

Hablando con @UnivisionNews sobre el discurso #SOTU de Trump. #twill #HereToStay pic.twitter.com/2wgF5E1UjM
-- Luis V. Gutierrez (@RepGutierrez) January 31, 2018

Gutierrez, who has said he will not seek re-election in 2018, has been a fervent critic of the president. After the State of the Union speech, the Chicago legislator issued a statement in which he called Trump ""an outwardly, explicitly racist American President.""
After the Congressman's clarification about the reasons for his early departure, Fox News changed the headline on its article from ""Democrat Luis Gutierrez Storms Out of State of the Union During 'USA' Chant"" to ""Democrat Luis Gutierrez Walks Out of State of the Union Early.""
It's true that Gutierrez left his seat as Congress members chanted ""U.S.A.!"" during Donald Trump's State of the Union speech on 30 January 2018. However, there is no evidence that he did so because of those chants, which came towards the end of an unusually long speech by Trump, and with Gutierrez on his way to a media commitment.

186.USArmyMemoAnnouncesP,"
It's something of an election year tradition for dark conspiracy theories to circulate during the waning months of the U.S. presidential campaign, with rumor-mongers warning of an imminent military takeover by the power-hungry incumbent (regardless of which party that incumbent represents). In August 2016, after a round of the usual false rumors about the President surreptitiously granting himself  ""unprecedented powers"" via executive order, etc., a JPEG image popped up on social media purporting to be a scan of a U.S. Army memorandum announcing that training and preparation for martial law would begin on 8 September 2016 at Fort Carson, Colorado.
Albeit riddled with misspellings and grammatical errors -- not to mention the nonsensical claim that ""the Bill for the Executive Order Enacting Martial Law has been put into effect"" -- the document instantly went viral and was shared on conspiracy web sites such as Red Flag News, and via YouTube in videos like this one:
 
However, given that examples of unclassified U.S. Army memorandums are plentiful online, the document would have been very easy to fake -- and, in fact, it was faked. When we queried officials at Fort Carson about the memo on 22 August 2016, we received the following response:
The Facebook posting showing what appears to be an official 4th Infantry Division memo stating that Fort Carson is starting martial law training is a complete fabrication.  There is no training being conducted on Fort Carson concerning any type of martial law preparation. The Posse Comitatus Act forbids military involvement in domestic law enforcement without congressional approval.

Claim



			A picture from Hunter Biden's laptop shows Paul Pelosi Jr., the son of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, doing lines of cocaine with a ""tied up Asian girl."" 
		



Rating









Miscaptioned


							About this rating
						











Context
The simple truth was that the photograph showed Paul Pelosi Jr. helping a little girl cut a cake. Other pictures showed that the girl was one of several children of a woman Pelosi allegedly had a relationship with. The little girl was not tied up, no cocaine was visible, and there's no evidence that the image had anything to do with a laptop, much less Hunter Biden's.






 






In July 2022, following the news that Hunter Biden's iCloud account had allegedly been hacked, conspiracy theorists shared a picture that they claimed came from a laptop that also was associated with U.S. President Joe Biden's son. The photograph purportedly showed Paul Pelosi Jr., the son of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, doing lines of cocaine with a ""tied up Asian girl."" A review of the facts showed that none of these accusations were true.
Misleading Memes
The truth of this picture was that it simply showed Paul Pelosi Jr. cutting a cake with a young girl. The girl was not ""tied up,"" nor was cocaine visible anywhere in the photograph. The only other visible objects on the table appeared to be bottles of Gatorade. Further, there was no evidence that the picture had anything to do with a laptop or Hunter Biden. 






One of the false memes from Twitter read, ""Just Nancy Pelosi's son with a tied up Asian girl doing lines of coke. Found on Hunter's laptop. Still think this is Russia disinformation? WAKE THE FUCK UP.""
An Alleged Relationship
We previously reported on various rumors regarding a laptop apparently owned by Hunter Biden, which became a larger story in November 2020. Fact-checkers at PolitiFact rated the Pelosi Jr. conspiracy theory ""False"" just days before the 2020 U.S. presidential election, which meant that it, too, was an old rumor.
According to PolitiFact's reporting, the little girl appeared to be the daughter of Karen Feng, a woman Pelosi Jr. allegedly had a relationship with. Images of him with Feng and several children were posted in stories published by the National File website in late 2019. This evidence showed that the rumor about Pelosi Jr. being ""with a tied up Asian girl doing lines of coke"" was false.
Hunter Biden's iCloud Account
Rumors that Hunter Biden's iCloud account was compromised by a 4chan message board user first went around in July 2022, when a hacker claimed to have accessed 450 GB of files from an iPhone and iPad associated with the president's son. News of the purported hack quickly made its way around social media, prompting the resurrection of older rumors, including some tied to Biden's laptop, such as the one about Pelosi Jr. and the little girl.
Other rumors and hoaxes we reported on in the wake of the alleged iCloud hack included images from a video supposedly showing Joe Biden naked with a young girl. Another misleading picture did not show Hunter Biden with underage girls, despite what some social media users claimed, nor did he pose shirtless in a bedroom with former first lady Melania Trump.
A Grain of Salt
This advisory we published prior to debunking those rumors still holds true:
At this stage, we advise readers to take individual rumors and memes that appear to be blooming out of this alleged hack with a grain of salt. This is not to say that this material should automatically be presumed to be false (or true). Rather, it's simply the case that the 4chan message board has a long history of delivering up questionable content, none of this material has yet been verified as authentic, and partisans on both sides of the political divide are likely to try to recast it to their advantage.
In sum, no, Paul Pelosi Jr. was not pictured with a ""tied up Asian girl doing lines of coke,"" nor was there any evidence that the photograph had anything to do with a laptop, much less Hunter Biden's. The picture simply showed a Pelosi Jr. helping a young girl cut a cake.

Any photographing, recording, or rebroadcasting of the proceedings is prohibited by law, according to the Department of Justice, though there are overflow rooms in the courthouse for reporters and spectators where they can watch live feeds of the trial. 
But that doesn't mean reporters aren't there. They are -- and plenty of them.

Brown spoke on Reliable Sources about the conspiracy theories that the media isn't covering the trial: ""There's so many media there that there's, some days, three overflow courtrooms full of the public and media. So that isn't an issue. The issue is the access to the actual courtroom where this is happening and the fact that there is a limited number of people who can actually get in.""
CNN reporter Lauren del Valle has filed stories and tweeted about the trial. The New York Times, the New York Post, the Independent and the Associated Press have been providing live updates from the trial.
A spokesperson with the district court where Maxwell's trial is underway told us in a statement that the trial is open to anyone who would like to attend, and that during opening statements more than 140 people were in attendance.

In March 2017, a strange piece of footage started circulating on conspiracy theory web sites along with a variety of titles and claims, such as ""Human or not? Bikers in Indonesia film a mysterious humanoid creature,"" and ""Real Hobbit is Accidentally Caught On Camera in Aceh Forest."" 
The video, which reportedly shows a naked man spooking a group of dirt bikers before disappearing into a field of tall grass, was originally uploaded to the YouTube page ""Fredography"" on 22 March 2017:
Although the video's description provided a general location for the footage -- the Aceh region of Indonesia -- the uploader was not willing to provide further information:
Do not ask where, will remain confidential! Watch alone ... ""could be a primitive population, could be the claimant black magic."" 






So what exactly does this video show? Let's examine some of the most prominent theories behind this footage.
It's fake
While conspiracy theorists may claim that the figure spotted in this video is some sort of hobbit or humanoid, other commentators had a simpler explanation: It's fake. This theory holds that the ""creature"" was digitally inserted into the footage, similar to this video of a bear chasing a biker through the woods, or this video of a snowboarder being chased by another bear.  
The most convincing piece of evidence for this theory is a still frame from the video:

Other commenters claim that the real evidence that the video was faked comes toward the end of the footage, when the figure disappears into the tall grass:
Look carefully when the man enters the tall grass. The grass didn't even move one bit and the man just disappears.
We slowed down the video to take a closer look at this moment, and did not find that argument convincing. Once the figure ""disappears,"" the stick it is carrying can still be seen as it enters the grass: 







It's a hobbit/Manti tribe member
One of the reasons that this video has become so popular is its connection to a piece of Indonesian folklore. Many believe that the figure seen in the video matched the description (tan, with a short stature) of the mythical Mante Tribe. However, experts say that there is little evidence this tribe exists:
Anthropologist Fikarwin Zuska of the University of North Sumatra in Medan said no scientific research had proven the existence of the Mante tribe.
""The tribe has only been found in Aceh or Gayo folklore,"" Fikarwin said on Friday, adding that books based on folklore made some people consider the story part of history.
Aceh historian Rusdi Sufi is also doubtful that the figure seen in the video was a Mante tribe member:
No, the video is circulating in Aceh, a bit strange indeed, but something that seemed odd was too exaggerated.
It's a person
It is entirely possible, given how the Internet is, that the figure seen in this video was digitally created as some sort of prank. It is also possible (although highly unlikely) that this footage shows a member of a previously undiscovered ""pygmy tribe"".  However, the most plausible explanation is also the simplest: The video shows a nearly naked human, possibly a child, spooking a group of dirt bike riders before disappearing into a field of tall grass. An unusual scene, and possibly a prankster, but nothing more than that.

On Nov. 3, Twitter temporarily locked Robinson's account after she posted a link to that article. When her account was reinstated on Nov. 9, she appears to have posted once again on the subject of Luciferase, and Twitter then enacted the permanent ban.
A company spokesperson told Snopes the ban was in response to ""repeated violations of our COVID-19 misinformation policy"" -- which prohibits, among other types of harmful content, ""False or misleading information about the efficacy and/or safety of preventative measures, treatments, or other precautions to mitigate or treat the disease.""
In a follow-up blog post on Nov. 9, Robinson doubled down on her nonsensical claims of a Satanic conspiracy, writing ""The new COVID-19 antibody test is called SATiN,"" and adding ""I'm not getting anywhere near this dark stuff."" Despite ""satin"" being an entirely different word with no shared meaning or common etymological root with ""Satan,"" Robinson concluded:
You don't have to be a Christian to understand: names matter. It's not an accident that they've given this name to this test. It's a warning.
Robinson joined Newsmax as its White House Correspondent in February 2020 after serving in a similar role at OANN (One America News Network) -- like Newsmax, a previously lesser-known right-wing media platform given a boost in popularity and prominence under the administration of former President Donald Trump. According to her own website, Robinson grew up in rural Virginia. 
Snopes asked Newsmax whether Robinson was still limited to non-broadcast duties at the company, or if her employment status had changed. We did not receive a response in time for publication.

Lynne Knowles didn't expect a Facebook Live video she made about getting followed by a strange man in a grocery store to rack up millions of views, but the Pinellas County, Florida, resident's warning to friends wound up being a viral sensation.
Knowles posted the video on 17 September 2018, warning women that she had seen men lurking around parking lots, and that one man had gone so far as stalk her as she shopped at a Publix grocery store near her home in August. ""Be very careful,"" she warned. ""Ladies, tell your daughters. Men, tell your daughters they've got to be careful coming in and out of parking lots. They've got to be very aware of their surroundings and carry their keys in their hands. If nothing else, have a head set on because it at least looks like you're hooked up to a phone and can call 911 immediately"":
 
As a result of the video, Knowles has been featured in a number of local news stories, some of which reported that local police countered perhaps her most explosive comment: that the incidents she described were evidence that human trafficking was afoot in Pinellas County. 






""There's human trafficking going on,"" Knowles said in the video. ""There are men posted all over parking lots, they're following women and they're trying to grab them."" (The video, captioned, ""PLEASE BE AWARE OF THE DANGER OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING!!"", had been shared a quarter of a million times and viewed by 8.3 million people as of 19 September 2018, just two days after it was posted.)
Pinellas County Sheriff's Sgt. Spencer Gross told us police have seen no evidence of a rash of attempted kidnappings or human trafficking activity in the area. He said Knowles didn't report the incident in which she was followed in the grocery store to police, but he added that investigators are trying to track down the other encounters described in the video: ""We arrested a guy two weeks ago who followed a woman into a restaurant bathroom and recorded her. We do have creepers, and we do investigate those. Are we seeing an increase? I wouldn't say an increase but we do get those complaints.""
Some Facebook users accused Knowles of spreading hoaxes and ""fake news."" Others poked fun at her or criticized her for promoting ""hysteria."" For her part, Knowles told us she didn't report the Publix incident because after she confronted the man, he stopped following her.
Knowles said that after she posted her video, multiple women reached out to her to relay similar experiences. ""I'm grateful for the literally millions of people who have reached out and said thank you,"" Knowles told us in a phone interview. While she has received some negative feedback, ""the good much outweighs the bad.""
Knowles told us she stands by every incident she described and maintained that while it may not be human trafficking, women are definitely experiencing scary incidents: ""I can't tell you exactly what's going on but it's happened multiple times. When you live somewhere and you know six or seven people who have the same experience -- I was trying to warn my friends, I had no idea it would ever go viral.""
One incident happened the same day Knowles posted the video, she said, when an older woman entered the Earth Origins health food store she was shopping at and reported she had been followed by a man through a parking lot who he tried to accost her. ""She was scared to death,"" Knowles recounted in the video. ""She's a trauma nurse, she told me, and she said she's never been so scared in her life. I understand because I was rattled by what happened at Publix.""
What happened to Knowles is hardly unusual. According to a February 2018 study on sexual harassment and assault lead by the non-profit organization Stop Street Harassment, the vast majority of women, some 81 percent, have experienced some form of sexual harassment and/or assault in their lifetimes, and 34 percent of women reported they have been followed. Furthermore, public spaces (such as grocery stores) are where sexual harassment most frequently occurs, according to the study. Most sexual harassment is perpetrated by male strangers, and a third of women reported experiencing anxiety or depression after such incidents.
Holly Kearl, executive director of Stop Street Harassment, told us Knowles' concerns for women's safety are legitimate. In an email, she stated that ""these are common and very scary occurrences for women,"" adding that ""If a woman has had this kind of experience and/or if she's heard about men attacking, kidnapping, raping or killing women in their area, they will feel less safe and more wary of any man they don't know who approaches them."" 






The term ""human trafficking"" refers to ""modern-day slavery and ""involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion to obtain some type of labor or commercial sex act."" Although victims of human trafficking come from an array of backgrounds, they are often recruited from socially-vulnerable groups. Many victims are migrants, and roughly a quarter of the world's 40.3 million trafficking victims are children. 
According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security:
[Traffickers] look for people who are susceptible for a variety of reasons, including psychological or emotional vulnerability, economic hardship, lack of a social safety net, natural disasters, or political instability. The trauma caused by the traffickers can be so great that many may not identify themselves as victims or ask for help, even in highly public settings.
It's no surprised Knowles initially suspected her safety concerns were related to human trafficking, because the term has been rocketing around the Internet, although it is often employed in the service of bogus conspiracy theories. The Pizzagate conspiracy theory perhaps most famously (and falsely) accused 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and other prominent Democrats of running a child trafficking ring out of a basement at a Washington, D.C. pizza restaurant (which actually has no basement).
Since the Pizzagate phenomenon, similarly outlandish claims have been fed into cyberspace, including a June 2018 incident in which a group of men stumbled into what they claimed to be a ""bunker"" used for child sex trafficking. Police investigated and determined the ""bunker"" was nothing more than an abandoned homeless encampment. (Child trafficking is also a key component to the far-fetched but popular fabrication that is the Qanon conspiracy theory.)
Regardless of terminology, Knowles said the reason she posted her video was to warn women to be careful and had no ill intent. ""The video speaks for itself and the intent was only to bring good and awareness to people. That's all.""

1.2K1Q: Does searching an obituary website prove that there were no shooting deaths at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Feb. 14?

A: No. A website falsely suggests that there were no deaths because the victims' obituaries couldn't be found on one particular site.
FULL ANSWER
Each of the 17 people who died in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Feb. 14 has an obituary online. Some of them have more than one.
Newspapers across the country also have done memorial features on the victims.
But a website that posts conspiracy theories recently suggested that there were no obituaries for the victims of the shooting in a story headlined, ""Florida Obituaries show no Parkland school shooting deaths.""
The site, called Fellowship of the Minds, has been spreading conspiracy theories since 2013 about such tragedies as the Sandy Hook school shooting and the Boston Marathon bombing. We recently wrote about another false story on the website that claimed the ""March for Our Lives"" rally was planned months in advance -- it wasn't.
The story on the Parkland obituaries has been copied by several other websites and posted to Facebook, where users flagged it as potentially false. It leaves the false impression that there were no deaths.
The story is based on the results of a search on the obituary website Tributes.com.
It's true that obituaries for the victims of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, don't show up in a search on that site. But it's not true that the victims don't have obituaries at all.
Here is a list of all 17 who died with their ages and links to their obituaries on the website of Parkland's local newspaper, the Sun-Sentinel. Some also have obituaries posted on the website of the funeral home that handled their services:
1. Alyssa Alhadeff, 14
2. Scott Beigel, 35
3. Nicholas Dworet, 17
4. Martin Duque, 14
5. Aaron Feis, 37
6. Jaime Guttenberg, 14
7. Christopher Hixon, 49
8. Luke Hoyer, 15
9. Cara Loughran, 14
10. Gina Montalto, 14
11. Joaquin Oliver, 17
12. Alaina Petty, 14

A Facebook post poking fun at flat-earth believers and conspiracy theorists went viral on 29 December 2016, claiming that the 7 December 1941 attack Pearl Harbor was an ""inside job.""
As ""proof,"" the meme's creator scrawled a red line from Japan to Hawaii on a flat rectangular map that circumvented land masses -- glossing over factual contradictions and errors including that the map's flatness made the distance between the two locations appear to be a ridiculously large one, that planes don't need to skirt land masses (they can indeed fly over land), and that the attack planes didn't fly the entire distance from Japan to Hawaii because they were brought to within striking range of Oahu on aircraft carriers:

 
The image was originally posted in a closed Facebook group called the ""Politics and Sociology Confederacy"" by Caleb Harris. Harris said he meant the image as a gag, but he noticed after posting it that people had begun to share his image widely across social media:
I posted the photo in the Politics and Sociology group for a joke as it clearly isn't a very serious group, then Wednesday night [29 December 2016] it began popping up on my news feed and I started getting messages from people who took it too seriously.
Harris said he purposely got the date wrong by ten years, and drew the line around the land masses to make it look ""more stupid.""
Harris said the image was mostly meant to make fun of people who believe the world is flat, but there is, of course, a conspiracy theory that claims the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was an ""inside job."" It falls in line with other ""false flag"" conspiracy theories by alleging the U.S. government allowed a catastrophic attack on its own soil for the express purpose of advancing military strategic goals.

Rumors are surging in the wake of George Floyd's death and resulting protests against police violence and racial injustice in the United States. Stay informed. Read our special coverage, contribute to support our mission, and submit any tips or claims you see here.

On June 27, 2020, a few violent confrontations erupted at Art Hill in St. Louis, Missouri, as different groups of protesters clashed over whether a statue of King Louis IX should be removed from that site. No serious injuries were reported. When videos of these incidents started to circulate online, they were frequently accompanied by the claim that praying Catholics had been attacked by Black Lives Matters protesters.

Yesterday, while praying for peace and unity in our city and the protection of the Saint Louis statue, Black Lives Matter protesters started to harass, berate, and assault the Catholics that were peacefully praying. We did nothing in retaliation 
(Thread with documentation) 1/8 pic.twitter.com/3jLDZUwDvY
-- Conor Martin (@CMartinForMO) June 28, 2020
 






This is a genuine video of an incident that occurred on Art Hill. However, labeling this video as if it shows Black Lives Matter activists attacking Catholics who were simply praying mischaracterizes the nature of these altercations. 
Black Lives Matter Versus Catholics?
We'll go into detail about what transpired in St. Louis, but let's address the general claim right at the top. These videos don't show ""Black Lives Matter"" activists beating up ""Catholics"" who were just praying at the feet of a statue of King Louis IX. Claims using this language omit some key details. 
The group described as ""Catholics,"" for instance, was partly comprised of individuals who align themselves with hate groups (such as the Proud Boys) and other white nationalist ideologies. Also, this prayer event was organized by the proprietor of a far-right conspiracy website. While there were certainly Catholics who attended this event in good faith, describing this entire group only as ""Catholics"" omits some very important and relevant details about who exactly was involved in these altercations. 
Furthermore, while the politics of the people who organized the counter-protest may align (at least in part) with the Black Lives Matter movement, and while there were Black Lives Matter activists present at this event, this was not an official BLM protest. This counter-protest was organized by Muslim and Jewish activists who wanted the statue taken down in part because of King Louis IX's persecution of Jews in the middle ages. 
Background
In mid-June 2020, a petition to have the King Louis IX statue removed from Art Hill and to rename the city of St. Louis, Missouri was filed on Change.org by Umar Lee, a Muslim activist and writer, and two other community activists:
St. Louis has a large and vibrant Jewish and Muslim community and it's an outright disrespect for those who are part of these faith communities to have to live in a city named after a man committed to the murder of their co religionists... I ask all people of good faith committed to the modern values of equity and coexistence to sign this petition to rename the City of St. Louis to something more suitable and indicative of our values. 






A few days after this petition was announced, Jim Hoft, the proprietor of the conspiracy theory website Gateway Pundit, started to organize a prayer rally to be held at the base of this statue.
Prayer Event Organized by Jim Hoft of The Gateway Pundit
This prayer event was not organized by a church or a religious group. Rather, it was started by Jim Hoft of The Gateway Pundit, a far-right website that traffics in conspiracy theories and misinformation. The website has been connected to ""crisis actor"" smears against environmental activists, they spread a ""Me Too"" hoax aimed at discrediting Robert Mueller, the special counsel overseeing an investigation into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and they've published inflammatory, misleading, and flat out false content related to mass shootings. 
On June 24, 2020, Hoft published an article on The Gateway Pundit calling for all ""Catholic and Christian men"" in the St. Louis area ""to join us in public prayer to save the iconic St. Louis statue in Forest Park.""
Hoft wrote: ""It's time the good God-fearing men in this country stand up. We cannot allow the continued assault on our country, our history and our culture. Please meet with us on Saturday at noon in Forest Park at the St. Louis Statue on Art Hill.""
Shortly after Hoft called for ""God-fearing men"" to gather at Art Hill, Lee called on protesters to gather at the same location to ""Stop Hate and Racism"": 

Yes, Catholic Priests Spoke at the Event
Regardless of its politically tinged origins, this event was truly attended by at least two Catholic priests. St. Louis Today (website of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper) identified Rev. Stephen Schumacher and Rev. Samuel Miloscia as two of the faith leaders who spoke during the event.  






The local news outlet KMOV4 also reported that ""many Catholics"" were in attendance to pray at the base of the statue:
During Saturday's rally, many Catholics prayed at the base of the statue and said they want to see it remain.
""This is a religious symbol of everything I hold dear. St. Louis is a citizen of heaven,"" one woman named Beverly said. ""We have to take a stand now, we can't allow mob rule, this is totalitarianism.""
We reached out to Miloscia for more information but have not been able to find contact information for Schumacher. We'll update this article if more information becomes available. 
Members of the Proud Boys Also Attended the Event
Not only was the event organized by the proprietor of a far-right conspiracy website, it was also attended by several members of the ""Proud Boys,"" a hate group according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. 
The St. Louis American reported that at least five Proud Boys were at the event. Two of those people, Mike Lasater and Luke Rohlfing, have confirmed their involvement on social media:
At around 11 a.m., several dozen Catholics - a predominantly white group - and others, including at least two identified members of the white supremacist hate group the Proud Boys, gathered at the statue to pray and to speak about how they believed it should not come down. While there were five men at the gathering who identified themselves as members of the Proud Boys, those whose names have been confirmed as of this writing are Mike Lasater and Luke Rohlfing.
A video shows one of these men with a ""proud boys"" tattoo on his arm:

If anyone wants to try and identify these guys they seemed happy to be photographed pic.twitter.com/ok8OWxo8U9
-- Sophie ""a Jewish"" Hurwitz (@sophiehurwitz) June 27, 2020 







Members of the White Nationalist-Linked Invaders Motorcycle Club Were Also in Attendance
A photograph from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch shows members of the Invaders Motorcycle Club standing guard near the base of the statue. We do not know the identities of these individuals, but the Invaders Motorcycle Club has been previously linked to white nationalist ideologies. Their website, for instance, is adorned with SS lightning bolts.
The Anti-Defamation League writes:
The SS Bolts are a common white supremacist/neo-Nazi symbol derived from Schutzstaffel (SS) of Nazi Germany. The SS, led by Heinrich Himmler, maintained the police state of Nazi Germany. Its members ranged from agents of the Gestapo to soldiers of the Waffen (armed) SS to guards at concentration and death camps.
What Happened During the Two Incidents of Violence?
As far as we can tell, there were two major altercations during this event, the first dealing with a man in a bright green shirt, the second involving a man dressed in black. St. Louis Post-Dispatch captured photographs of the first incident, which apparently started after a pink liquid was poured over the man in the green shirt, whom we will refer to as Paul.

Photos from Saturday's protest in St. Louis against a statue of the namesake of St. Louis - Saint King Louis IX of France.https://t.co/6fpeQYBJl5 pic.twitter.com/19MZQMx07T
-- JERRY DUNLEAVY (@JerryDunleavy) June 28, 2020

The exact sequence of events that led to the altercation are unclear, but Paul wrote on Facebook that he ""applauded"" his attacker because the man was told just before the altercation that Paul was a member of the KKK. 
Paul also addressed a separate photograph which showed him holding a knife at the protest. Paul said that he did not pull out the knife until after the altercation when he was leaving as a show of strength:
Here is the truth about the knife, yes I had a knife in my pocket at the rally, I did not brandish it until I was leaving after I was hit and flex my biceps as a show of strength and resolve against the Radical Muslim Group that organized the counter protest against the catholic prayerful. It has nothing to do with black people, I love black people. I applaud the guy for hitting me; because he was told that I was a KKK member by Regional Muslim Action Network and Tishaura Jones (our treasurer for St Louis).
Furthermore: where are the pictures of the guys carrying AK-47 and AR-15 rifles at 11 am during prayers Saturday morning or when they can back after dark to tear the statue down, but the trucks with chains didn't show up?
Paul's assertion that some protesters were armed (although we're not sure of what type of weapons they carried) also appears to be accurate. But it should be noted that Missouri is an open-carry state and we are unaware of any arrests or incidents of violence that involved these weapons. 
Terrance Page, the man in the blue bandanna who struck Paul, told KMOV that he believed some of the people at this protest were part of terrorist groups and that they needed to be met with force. Page said: ""It's not acceptable, our country as a whole has failed to do it, that's it.""
The second incident took place after the rally ended (not while Catholics were kneeling in prayer before the statue) and involved a man who goes by Walker Moore on Twitter. Moore, who claims to be ""unapologetically catholic"" in his Twitter bio, has urged his fellow Catholics to fight:

While the photographs and videos from this event appear dramatic, there don't appear to have been any serious injuries. According to St. Louis Post-Dispatch, there was one report of fourth-degree assault to police from a man who said he was repeatedly slapped in the head, but as of this writing no arrests have been made.
Robert Cohen, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch photographer who captured several photographs from this incident, told us there were a few additional minor scuffles. In total, Cohen said, there were five incidents:
The first was when Jim Hoft and the Proud Boys went to leave. They were followed by protesters and their cars were surrounded but no violence. Police on the scene helped the cars leave the area.
The second involved a man who was taking cellphone photos of protesters. A man told him to stop and he didn't. Crowd surrounded him, knocked phone from his hands and took his hat. Police intervened, guy got the hat back and the lieutenant suggested he leave.
The third was a man confronted by Mr. Page who was also filming him. It was quick. Page and others chased him away. Police lieutenant also suggested he leave and then that officer left himself, leaving no police on the scene.
The fourth involved the situation everyone is talking about with Paul Metzger and Mr. Page. There are several photos of that in the gallery link.
The fifth was shortly after the third. Conor Martin and another man wearing black clothing were struck by several protesters. They ran away.
Number four was obviously the most significant one. I would say the first three were minor.
Umar Lee, one of the organizers of the ""Stop Hate and Racism"" gathering at the statue, disputed the idea that Catholics were attacked for praying during the event. Lee said that he had no problem with the priests or the people praying at the statue, but he did have a problem with the inclusion of the Proud Boys and other white nationalist-connected groups at the event:
Yes, there were devout Catholics, yes there were priest, nobody has any problem with any priests or Catholics praying or anything of that nature. But what we are not going to allow is in Forest park, in the heart of the city of St. Louis, we're not going to allow the alt-right to show up, the proud boys to show up, Jim Hoft to show up and have a rally to spread their white nationalism and not get a check back from us.
Circuit Attorney Kimberly Gardner said that her office would be investigating this incident, as well as another incident in St. Louis involving a white couple waving guns at Black Lives Matter protesters:

1/ I am alarmed at the events that occurred over the weekend, where peaceful protestors were met by guns and a violent assault. We must protect the right to peacefully protest, and any attempt to chill it through intimidation or threat of deadly force will not be tolerated.
-- Kimberly Gardner (@StLouisCityCA) June 29, 2020

Fr. Thomas Haake Was Not Injured at this Protest
After the incident in St. Louis, a photograph circulated supposedly showing Father Thomas Haake with a black eye.
The photograph on the left was truly taken in St. Louis during this incident. The photograph on the right, however, was not. We have not been able to confirm details about the image on the right, but it was originally shared on Instagram along with the claim that it showed Fr. Haake after he was mugged in Washington D.C. The alleged muggers have not been identified. We have reached out to Haake for more information. 
In Summary
Videos and photographs truly show a few violent altercations between two groups of people who disagreed over the removal of a statue of King Louis IX at Art Hill in Forest Park in St. Louis, Missouri, in June 2020. While this event was attended in good faith by some Catholics who wanted to pray for the statue to remain, this prayer rally was organized by a hyperpartisan conspiracy website, not a church, and involved several people associated with hate groups and white nationalist ideologies.

Rumors are surging in the wake of George Floyd's death and resulting protests against police violence and racial injustice in the United States. Stay informed. Read our special coverage, contribute to support our mission, and submit any tips or claims you see here.

Early in the morning on June 9, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump tuned in to the conspiracy-theory-promoting One America News Network (OANN). The message the president evidently took from this early morning TV session was that the 75-year-old man violently pushed to the ground by Buffalo Emergency Response Team officers during a protest in Niagara Square was actually an ""ANTIFA provocateur"" whom the police were justified in pushing because he was ""appearing to scan police communications in order to black out the equipment.""

Rumors of ""antifa"" inciting violence during these protests, an assertion originating with a fake tweet by the white nationalist group Identity Evropa, have continued to stew in right-wing circles, despite a marked lack of evidence for the narrative. 






In their segment on Martin Gugino, OANN used as their source an article from the website Conservative Treehouse (CTH), which was authored by someone who goes by the name ""sundance."" That article makes two primary assertions that OANN later broadcast to the president:
""Martin Gugino is a 75-year-old professional agitator and Antifa provocateur... On Friday Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown admitted Gugino was a professional 'agitator' who tried to work up the crowd and had been asked to leave the area 'numerous' times.""
""During his effort Gugino was attempting to capture the radio communications signature of Buffalo police officers.""
The claim that Gugino was labeled an ""agitator"" by the mayor of Buffalo -- though repeated ad nauseam in news reports and fact checks -- is demonstrably false. The vague assertion that this man's waving cell phone ""capture[d] the radio communications signature of Buffalo police officers"" is inconsistent with the evidence CTH themselves cited to support that notion.
Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown Did Not 'Admit' Gugino was an 'Agitator'
The single shred of purportedly factual evidence that this conspiracy rests on is that Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown ""admitted"" Gugino was an ""agitator"" and ""instigator."" Major media outlets including The Daily Beast, New York Daily News, New York Post, TMZ, and The Hill, as well as the fact-checking website TruthorFiction, each reported as fact that Brown made this comment regarding Gugino.
All of these reports are based on an incorrect local news account of a press conference held on June 5. As is clear from the transcript of the press conference, this reporting erroneously conflated the mayor's comments regarding two separate instances of police force. The words ""agitator"" and ""instigator"" were used in reference to Myles Carter, who was protesting earlier in the week at a different location on Bailey Avenue and was tackled from behind by New York State police. The mayor's use of the these words clearly refers to the Carter incident, not Gugino (emphasis ours):
Reporter: This [the Martin Gugino incident] wasn't the only incident that happened this week. Monday night, Myles Carter was on Bailey Avenue protesting. He was 15, 20 yards away from a police line with his back and hands up to the police, out of nowhere seemingly they rushed him, arrested him and charged him with two misdemeanors. ... Why not the response Monday night, looking at the officers, temporarily suspending them and having an internal investigation there? I mean, the tape was pretty clear. He wasn't doing anything.
Mayor:  Those were state police officers. Those were not Buffalo police officers. So obviously the city of Buffalo does not have the ability to take action against state police officers. But what we were informed of is that that individual was an agitator. He was trying to spark up the crowd of people, again, that was a curfew violation. [...]  And according to what has been reported to me, that individual was a key and major instigator of people engaging in those kinds of activities.
Some outlets, such as The Daily Beast and The Hill, have issued corrections. ""This article previously claimed Mayor Brown referred to 75-year-old activist Martin Gugino as a 'major instigator,' but upon review of audio from the press conference, it is clear he was referring to a separate incident,"" wrote The Daily Beast. Unfortunately, these corrections have done little to stem the flow of false information surrounding the incident. 






Gugino does have a history of activism -- he was described by the Buffalo News as ""a longtime peace activist."" None of the organizations he has worked with can credibly be considered a part of the purported ""antifa"" movement, which is not a single organization but is instead a decentralized movement opposed to fascism that has endorsed violence as a political tactic. Gugino has been an activist for decades through his work with ""People United for Sustainable Housing Buffalo"" and ""The Western New York Peace Center."" There is no evidence these organizations are secretly part of ""antifa,"" whatever that would mean in practice.
According to the Buffalo News, ""Gugino has been involved in a broad array of issues ranging from nuclear disarmament to climate change and Guantanamo."" Gugino's attorney, Kelly Zarcone, told The Associated Press that Gugino ""has always been a peaceful protester because he cares about today's society.""
""No one from law enforcement has even suggested anything otherwise, so we are at a loss to understand why the president of the United States would make such dark, dangerous, and untrue accusations about him. We can confirm that those accusations are utterly baseless and ridiculous,"" Zarcone said.
The only evidence that Gugino's attendance at the Niagara Square rally on June 5 was anything other than peaceful comes from falsely attributing Brown's comments about Myles Carter to Gugino. Stripped of that falsehood, the sole remaining truth is that a 75-year-old, lifelong peace activist approached officers vaguely waving his phone before being knocked headfirst to the pavement where he lay unconscious with blood pooling out of his ear.
'Scanning Police Communications To Black Out Equipment' Makes No Sense
The assertion breathlessly promoted by OANN, and later Trump himself -- that Gugino's intent in approaching the officers pushed him was to manipulate, steal, or disarm police communications in some way -- comes from the fringe right-wing website ""Conservative Treehouse"" (CTH). OANN cited this website in the report Trump apparently watched. That article stated, with no evidence or exposition, that ""during his effort Gugino was attempting to capture the radio communications signature of Buffalo police officers."" The website presented ""a new video"" which they said confirmed their suspicions. This was not a new video, but instead merely a slower version of the original video that sparked international outrage.
CTH's analysis of this ""new"" slowed-down video is -- to put it mildly -- extremely vague. So vague, in fact, that it fails to present a single coherent hypothesis or claim. Among the possibilities proffered was the claim Trump went with in his tweet -- that Gugino was trying to ""black out"" the network. But other claims proffered by CTH also included attempting to track officers with their cell phones, unlocking encrypted networks, and messing with officers' potentially Bluetooth enabled devices -- each a wholly different hypothesis. The video cannot distinguish between these various hypotheses in part because the video can't actually tell us anything about what he was doing with his phone.
One thing the video can tell us, though, is what he was not doing. What he was not doing was attempting to capture radio signals from the police's communication system. In fact, the evidence that CTH themselves used to suggest he was performing some sort of action like that entirely undercuts their argument. Two ""sources"" were cited in support of the notion that radio frequency harvesting was what was going on: a thread apparently authored by the same person who wrote the CTH article, and an article from the website Electronics4u which describes how to receive radio signals on a mobile phone:
The capture of communications signals [explained in detail here] is a method of police tracking used by Antifa to monitor the location of police. In some cases the more high tech capture software can even decipher communication encryption allowing the professional agitators to block (black-out), jam, or interfere with police communication. In addition, many police body-cams are bluetooth enabled which allows syncing. 






The link that allegedly explains ""the more high tech"" way to decipher signals and how to ""block, jam, or interfere"" with police communications hyperlinks to the Electronis4u story, titled ""Software-Defined Radio with Android Smartphones."" Not only does this article make no mention of any blocking, jamming, or interference, it makes explicit the necessity of additional receiver hardware if one wanted to use a phone to do anything involving tuning into radio frequencies. (This appears to be the case for iPhones as well). Here is the setup that article highlighted, which shows the need for both an antenna and a dongle adapter to scan for frequencies:

In other words, based solely on the evidence provided by Conservative Treehouse, performing any task requiring knowledge of specific radio frequencies (including cloning or interference), would require hardware connected to the phone. The video, thanks to CTH's cutting edge slow motion analysis, makes clear that he had no such dongle or antenna connected to the phone:





We reached out to the Buffalo Police Department for clarification on their communication system and whether they were aware of any possible vulnerabilities that could arise from a cell phone waved in proximity to the officers. At the time of this reporting, we have not received a response.
Speaking to The Associated Press, Matt Blaze, a professor of computer science and law at Georgetown University, said the president's tweet regarding ""blacking out"" communication is ""so technically incomprehensible, I'm not even sure where to start.""  As the Post reported, ""It is possible to disrupt police radio -- an illegal action often called ""jamming"" -- but hackers can only do that by attacking receiving stations, not with handheld devices that target an individual police officer's radio, Blaze said.""
Ultimately, the allegation that a 75-year-old activist is actually a highly trained member of antifa capable of infiltrating an encrypted police communication network by waving his cell phone around is belied by the fact that his phone did not appear to have the equipment necessary to perform some of the actions he is accused of. It is also belied by a lack of any other corroborating evidence, as well as the inability for its adherents to articulate a concrete allegation. The only bit of additional evidence these claims rely on is the false assertion that the mayor of Buffalo stated Guginio was an ""agitator"" or an ""instigator.""
Unfortunately for CTH's embarrassingly under-theorized claim, the mayor of Buffalo never described Gugino this way.

""Shocking news!"" says the title of a nearly 13-minute video on Facebook. ""Mass media destroyed! Blackout for mass arrests event!"" 
But the video offers no evidence of the aforementioned shocking news. A woman can be heard reading what she calls a ""report"" as photos of cities and people are shown. She discusses shipping disruptions and the rising costs of goods, but also satanists and ""the cabal,"" which feature prominently in the QAnon conspiracy theory. 
""Between now and Thursday, Nov. 11,"" she says at one point, ""expect a market crash, blackouts, revelations, a military takeover, lockdowns, and mass arrests.""
About 10 minutes into the video, she says: ""Monday, Oct. 4, mass media satellites destroyed, world switched over to the Starlink satellite system that would eventually support a new internet. I'm wondering if that means the mass media is now completely controlled by the White House.""
Later she claims that Oct. 15 saw ""Canada's mainstream media arrested"" with ""the mass media across the globe to soon follow.""

58.DidtheQueenCallPresi,"
In the aftermath of U.S. President Donald Trump's state visit to the U.K., France, and Ireland in June 2019, some of his supporters began sharing a meme that appeared to contain glowing praise for the 45th president, provided by none other than Queen Elizabeth II.
The meme contained a photograph of Trump and Her Majesty sitting next to one another, along with the following quotation:
""'He's really just an amazing person. So thoughtful, you know. We've had some private talks and he is very genuine. I have a sense about people, and the president has a good heart. In another life, he could be my son'"":

The ""In Trump We Trust"" Facebook page provided the following additional context for the purported quotation: ""UK reporter says executives scrapped [an] entire interview with Queen Elizabeth after she repeatedly praised President Trump."" That post was removed on 7 June, but an archived version can be viewed here. 
On 4 June, the right-leaning, conspiracy-theory website ""Clover Chronicle"" published a post similarly asserting that: ""A staffer at an unnamed MSM [mainstream media] news outlet in the United Kingdom is claiming they were recently involved in an interview with Queen Elizabeth II where she unexpectedly complimented U.S. President Donald Trump. The alleged insider said executives at the organization are 'fuming' because they couldn't salvage the piece due to her relentless praise of the POTUS.""
Those claims originated with a 4 June post on the notorious /pol/ section of the online forum 4chan, a frequent source of hyper-partisan misinformation. There, an anonymous member wrote:
Was just involved in an exclusive interview with the Queen, but the execs at my company decided not to air it because she praised Trump so fucking much. It was literally impossible to edit and not make it look like total garbage. The brass are fuming, /pol/. It's as if she said fuck it and just spoke her mind. It was AMAZING. Here's just one of the questions/answers between her and the reporter-
Q: Many are wondering about your relationship with President Trump? Can you tell us a bit about it?
A: He's really just an amazing person. So thoughtful, you know. We've had some private talks and he is very genuine. I have a sense about people, and the President has a good heart. In another life, he could be my son.
After that, everyone was absolutely flabbergasted. I could tell it was hard for the interviewer to go on and follow the script, but he/she did nonetheless.
There was no factual basis to this story, and the remarks attributed to Elizabeth were fabricated. A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace confirmed as much to Snopes, writing in an email: ""Her Majesty The Queen does not give interviews, and did not give an interview.""

In a continuing attempt to portray Fulton County, Ga., as a haven for fraud and malfeasance in the 2020 presidential election, a new allegation asserts that thousands of the same ballots were counted multiple times in the county where heavily Democratic Atlanta is located.
One tweet claims the counts benefited Joe Biden, who defeated Donald Trump in Georgia, a key swing state, by about 12,000 votes.
""Why is it that errors seem to only ever go one way?"" the tweet asked. ""VoterGA says 4,255 ballots in Fulton County, Georgia were scanned multiple times. Of those duplicate ballots, 3,390 went to Biden.""
Claims of the multiple counting of the same ballots in Fulton County were also made on Facebook. And Trump, also citing the VoterGA group, issued a statement making allegations, including fraud, in the county's ballot counting.
The tweet was highlighted to PolitiFact by Vinesight, a company that monitors online misinformation.
Citing a history of election mismanagement in Fulton County, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on July 15 called for the firing of two of the county's top election officials. 
But there is no evidence of double-counting that would have given Biden anywhere near the number of extra votes being claimed. The double-counting that VoterGA claims it found were in what is known as a risk-limiting audit -- a hand recount of the vote. After that, a second recount was done. 
Statewide, the original count plus the two recounts all confirmed Biden's victory in Georgia
The group claiming the double counting
Voter GA, also known as Voters Organized for Trusted Election Results in Georgia, says it advocates for ""verifiable auditable recount capable and transparent elections."" It is led by Garland Favorito who, with others, filed a lawsuit seeking a review of the Fulton County's general-election absentee ballots in the 2020 election. 
A longtime critic of Georgia's election infrastructure, Favorito has promoted conspiracy theories about 9/11 and other topics, according to Georgia Public Radio, the New York Times and the Associated Press. He has also promoted affidavits signed by poll workers or observers in which they leap to conclusions about the integrity of absentee ballots, suggesting they weren't properly marked or weren't printed on normal paper. 
On July 13, Favorito and the group issued a news release that makes allegations of fraud and other election malfeasance in Fulton County, including the allegation referenced in the tweet. The group claimed it ""found at least 36 batches of mail-in ballots with 4,255 total extra votes were redundantly added into Fulton County audit results for the November election. These illicit votes include 3,390 extra votes for Joe Biden, 865 extra votes for Donald Trump and 43 extra votes for Jo Jorgenson,"" the Libertarian candidate. 
At a news conference on July 13, businessman David Cross, who is helping Favorito, displayed digital images of several ballots that he said shows ballots were scanned twice. Side by side, the ballots appeared to be identical, but contained different markings that Cross said indicated they were scanned more than once.

Says an image shows the Highland Park shooting suspect ""in jail or rehab or a psychiatric center"" before the shooting.
 











By Bill McCarthy * July 5, 2022







Cross sent PolitiFact, and posted online, information that he said supports the Voter GA's claim. He went further, claiming that he had found 6,415 extra votes counted in the risk-limiting audit, with an extra 5,128 going to Biden and 1,188 to Trump. 
What's been found
On the same day of the tweet, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that the people who filed the lawsuit discovered that nearly 200 Fulton County ballots had been scanned twice. The newspaper said it confirmed the double-counting by reviewing digital images of the ballots; the story included a link to the images. 
However, the double-counting was discovered in a recount and there is no indication Biden earned any additional votes in the official results, the newspaper said. The ballots counted twice would have given Biden 31 extra votes. After a recount, official results reflected that Trump gained a total of 121 absentee votes in Fulton. Biden won the county with 73% of 524,000 votes cast, the story said.
As we've reported, two recounts confirmed Biden won Georgia.
In all, the roughly 5 million ballots cast in Georgia were counted three times, including once by hand. The hand recount uncovered more than 2,600 uncounted votes, most of which favored Trump, in Floyd County, Ga. But election officials said the mistake was due to human error, not voter fraud. In the end, the certified results showed Biden beating Trump by 11,779 votes in the state. 
Alan Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University in Atlanta, said: ""Given that these ballots were all recounted by hand, there is no chance that a large number of ballots were double counted.""
University of West Georgia political scientist Thomas Hunter said none of the information provided by Voter GA proves that votes in the official certified results were counted twice. 
The official certified results were taken from the second recount, which was requested by the Trump campaign, he said. Even if some ballots were counted twice during the risk-limiting audit, he said, ""those numbers are not included in the official results. The official results are from the last recount, which was done by scanning all of the ballots. The results in the official count from Fulton County match quite closely to what the initial count showed.""
Hunter added: ""Any large-scale mistakes would have been found through the two recounts.""
The Georgia Secretary of State's office referred questions to Fulton County. A Fulton County spokeswoman declined comment, citing the lawsuit.
Our ruling
A tweet says that in the 2020 presidential election, ""4,255 ballots in Fulton County, Georgia, were scanned multiple times"" and ""3,390 went to Biden.""
Some 200 ballots initially were double-counted in Fulton County, where heavily Democratic Atlanta is located -- but there's no evidence of thousands, and the double-count didn't change the official result of Biden defeating Trump in Georgia.
We rate the claim False.

058.CIAAgentConfessesonD,"
On 13 July 2017, the YourNewsWire web site published an implausible article reporting that a dying CIA agent named Malcom Howard confessed to blowing up WTC Building 7 on 9/11 through controlled demolition:
79-year-old retired CIA agent, Malcom Howard, has made a series of astonishing claims since being released from hospital in New Jersey on Friday and told he has weeks to live. Mr. Howard claims he was involved in the ""controlled demolition"" of World Trade Center 7, the third building that was destroyed on 9/11.
Mr. Howard, who worked for the CIA for 36 years as an operative, claims he was tapped by senior CIA agents to work on the project due to his engineering background, and early career in the demolition business.
Trained as a civil engineer, Mr. Howard became an explosives expert after being headhunted by the CIA in early 1980s. Mr. Howard says has extensive experience in planting explosives in items as small as cigarette lighters and as large as ""80 floor buildings.""
The 79-year-old New Jersey native says he worked on the CIA operation they dubbed ""New Century"" between May 1997 and September 2001, during a time he says the CIA ""was still taking orders from the top."" Mr. Howard says he was part of a cell of 4 operatives tasked with ensuring the demolition was successful.
There was no truth to the story, which originated with YourNewsWire, a fake news site. As is often the case with fake news, the article lacked critical details such as when and where the confession occurred (other than the vague reference to its taking place ""at home""), YourNewsWire provide no explanation of how they alone (and no other news source) learned of this confession, and we found nothing documenting the existence of a former CIA agent named Malcom Howard outside of the just-published YourNewsWire piece.
Moreover, the article closely mimicked another fake news story published by YourNewsWire less than a month earlier, one holding that a retired MI5 agent had similarly confessed on his deathbed to assassinating Princess Diana.
The conspiracy theory that WTC7 was brought down through a secret controlled demolition (thereby establishing that the 9/11 attacks were a ""false flag operation"" and/or an ""inside job"") have been comprehensively debunked, with the evidence demonstrating that fire alone caused the building's collapse.

59.ConspiracyTheoriesAb,"
The now-predictable spike of distressing conspiracy theories and false flag claims after mass shootings or casualty events has become nearly a given, but the disinformation appeared to reach even higher heights after the 14 February 2018 Parkland school shooting killed seventeen people.
False flag rumors are far from new, and yet each new version is treated like a grand revelation -- one that has never resulted in any outcome that might have justified staging the event. Although the Sandy Hook shooting was not the first event of its type to spawn such claims, it did seem to catapult the rumors and their reach to new heights.
Chances are you've seen one, several, or all of these claims pop up on social media after a mass shooting:
The Second Shooter
Second shooter conspiracy theories far predate school or mass shootings or the online fallout that follows them. After the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, conspiracy theories began to circulate almost immediately after President Kennedy was shot, mostly through news broadcasts and gossip. Decades later, the ""second shooter"" claim remained one of the most enduring -- despite the National Academy of Sciences' Committee on Ballistic Acoustics 1982 finding that ""reliable acoustic data do not support a conclusion that there was a second gunman."" 






Nevertheless, the ""second shooter"" became somewhat of a fallback claim to suggest any official narrative is faulty. After the Sandy Hook shooting the claim took root once again, likely due to the detainment of parent Chris Manfredonia, who was not involved but who was briefly handcuffed after running into the school to search for his daughter directly after the shooting.
Incidentally, two shooters were present at what is largely considered the first school shooting of its type: Columbine in 1999. Although two perpetrators, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, carried out the massacre, no one disputed its legitimacy at the time, and despite the fact two shooters were involved, the shooting was not described as a ""false flag.""
Crisis Actors
Another conspiracy trope that got a foothold after the Sandy Hook shooting involved the increasingly absurd notion that ""crisis actors"" are hired to represent victims, the bereaved, or both. Not long after that incident, family members of slain children and survivors of the massacre were harassed and threatened for being ""paid actors."" Notable instances of the claim occurred after the Pulse nightclub shooting, and again following the Parkland, Florida shooting.
One iteration of the claim involves the ""same girl,"" who is purportedly present at various crime scenes, vigils, or funerals spanning continents:

Real people are dead and grieving after school shootings; they're not acting: https://t.co/iqXzZdKz1B
-- snopes.com (@snopes) February 20, 2018

The assertion crumbles under even a tiny amount of scrutiny. Nonetheless, conspiracy theorists playing at being amateur detectives still claim that young women with long hair crying at the scenes of mass casualty events are clear signs that the events are not what they seem. 






Timestamp Lawyering
The ""hole in the narrative"" rumor based on news and social media timestamps is now a fixture after tragic events. After a Virginia shooting made headlines, conspiracy theorists claimed timestamps on social media posts revealed the tragedy was a hoax, a claim that popped up yet again after the Parkland school shooting.
A Google spokesperson told us that timestamps have been a known issue with search engines for years:
Listing the date and time for news stories is complicated, as there is no universal standard used. Sometimes, stories have no date and time on the webpage. Sometimes, a story may appear on a page that lists related stories, and they all have different dates and times shown. Sometimes a publisher might be in a different time zone and the date gets picked up incorrectly. All these things may cause us to occasionally list the wrong date. We're looking at ways to improve.
To Pass Gun Control Legislation
The Sandy Hook massacre, which left twenty children and six adults dead, was arguably the genesis of mass and school shooting truthers. That began (and continues) with rumors often based on unsourced blog posts, such as one published by a woman using the handle ""Short Little Rebel"" on 16 December 2012:
I believe our GOVERNMENT shot those kids and teachers and used Adam Lanza and his family to pull it off. They might have killed two birds with one stone. One: If these men are involved in the LIBOR scandal, they can manipulate their testimony. Two: they get gun control. How very, very clever and efficient of them, right? I hate to say it. I hate to put myself 'out there' with this because I KNOW how I will be attacked. But I don't do this for anyone's approval. I do it to help the American People.
But Why?
Nearly every mass shooting since on American soil has led to embittered fighting both among lawmakers and on social media, occurring under the assumption that gun control legislation will yank firearms from the hands of American citizens. While that is presumably the reason for the many ""false flag"" events invoking these tropes, not a one has led to any massive change to gun laws.
Another reason for conspiracy theorizing is a simple one: It offers a certain idea of predictability and order in a world that seems more chaotic by the year. For some, it is undoubtedly better and easier to go about their day assuming not that they could be shot at random by a madman at any given second, but that no one has actually died in any of these horrific events and that some sort of greater power is putting together hoaxes in order to manipulate public opinion.
That there might be some higher order and that no mass shootings ever have taken place may be a comforting idea for some people, certainly, but it's also one that has absolutely no basis in fact -- as anyone who has either been through one themselves or lost a loved one could undoubtedly tell you.

47.DidSarahJeongTweetTh,"
In August 2018, a number of years-old tweets posted by journalist Sarah Jeong were dug up and re-shared on the internet in an attempt to show that the newest member of The New York Times' editorial board exhibited a pervasive (anti-white) racial bias:
Once Jeong's hiring was announced, her detractors immediately started digging through her internet history to see what they could find. A survey of Jeong's past commentary on Twitter reveals several mainly sarcastic tweets dating back to 2013, which were largely discussing and responding to the oppressive mentality of white culture.

In tweets like the one embedded above, Jeong appeared to be commenting on the idea that white people often believe they are being discriminated against when they aren't. To equate ""being mean to white people"" with the actual systemic oppression and marginalization of minority groups is a false equivalency.
Although similar campaigns had resulted in the firings of people such film director James Gunn, the New York Times stuck by their decision to hire Jeong. The controversy slowly faded from the national spotlight, but Jeong remained a target of political trolls.
In mid-October 2018, a tweet supposedly posted by Jeong popped up on social media and was pushed by disreputable Twitter accounts with a history of promoting debunked conspiracy theories and spreading alt-right propaganda:
 






This statement (""Everytime i see a bald white kid, i secretly hope he has leukemia and do my own little private 'end-zone' dance"") does not currently appear on Jeong's Twitter timeline, nor did we find any record of it in Jeong's online articles.
Social media users dredged through Jeong's social media accounts for similar controversial messages in August 2018. Although these internet investigators dug up dozens of genuine posts which they deemed to be problematic, such as the #Cancelwhitepeople"" message seen above, those examples apparently weren't damaging enough for some internet trolls. Soon, 4Chan users started to create fabricated racist posts which they then falsely attributed to Jeong.
We found a number of these fabricated posts in 4chan threads from early August 2018 (including one about a ""castration lottery""), most of which featured the same template as the fake ""leukemia"" quote: a picture of Jeong with pink hair next to a black space containing the alleged quote, Jeong's name, and her position at the New York Times:

These fake statements were often met by commentators questioning their authenticity, asking for verification, or chastising the poster for spreading false material. One of the earliest postings of the fake ""leukemia"" quote was accompanied by the following comments:

Jeong's detractors took screenshots and archived the problematic tweets in case the journalist decided to later delete them, yet we found no record of Jeong's making this ""leukemia"" tweet. That message was conjured out of thin air in an attempt to stir racial discord and discredit Jeong and the New York Times.
Jeong herself labeled the message a ""fake tweet"" on 15 October 2018:

25.Whatyouneedtoknowabo,"
Several weeks after the 2020 election, groups of electors gathered in state Capitols to sign certificates affirming which candidate won their state -- a routine step in the process of a president taking office. 
But on the same day -- Dec. 14, 2020 -- something unusual happened: In several battleground states where Joe Biden had defeated President Donald Trump, representatives of the losing side decided that they, too, would gather as purported electors to sign certificates falsely attesting to a Trump win and submit them for approval by Congress.
Months later, American Oversight, a watchdog group that seeks to hold Trump accountable through public records requests, published the phony certificates calling them ""part of the failed attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election."" 
This was no small caper by a few disappointed Trump loyalists. 
The fake electoral certificates were signed by Republican state lawmakers and party officials in Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada and New Mexico, states accounting for a combined 84 electoral votes. And like the violent insurrectionists who came to the Capitol on Jan. 6 with knives, bats and other weapons, the fake electors sought to overturn a democratic election through extralegal means. They did so in a coordinated effort, mostly out in the open, and through official channels.
""This is like the mother of all heist movies,"" said Jeffrey Mandell, president of the Wisconsin democracy group Law Forward, which asked state and local officials in early 2021 to investigate the certificate signed by 10 people in his state. ""It was an attempt by 10 people to disregard the votes of 3.3 million of their neighbors and decide they know best and disregard the will of the voters so they get to hijack Wisconsin's participation in choosing the next president.""
Like the rioters, they failed. But their efforts are drawing renewed attention after a Justice Department official told CNN that the agency is investigating the fake certificates. So are state prosecutors and the Jan. 6 committee in Congress. 
Here's a look at what we know about the fake certificates, how they came about, who signed them and what happens next. 
What are the certificates, and what do they say?
Every four years, when voters cast ballots in a presidential election they are choosing between slates of electors pledged to one of the candidates, in this case either for Biden or Trump. (The process is outlined in the U.S. Constitution.) Electors are chosen by political parties in each state before the election. If, say, Biden, wins a particular state, his slate of electors gather weeks after Election Day to sign a certificate reflecting their votes for Biden. The certificates are forwarded to Congress. 
Most of the fake certificates were put forward as if they were real ones. They have a header that says ""certificate of the votes of the 2020 electors,"" and the signers refer to themselves as ""being duly elected and qualified electors."" The certificates say they gathered to vote for Trump and are signed by anywhere from five to 20 people, depending on the number of electoral votes assigned to the state.
The certificates in Pennsylvania and New Mexico hedged by tweaking the language suggesting that they would be the electors if it was later determined they were the electors -- for instance, through a final court order. 
The documents state that they were sent to the National Archives and state officials including governors or secretaries of states.
""It was not freelancing. It was a coordinated effort,"" said Norman Eisen, who was special counsel to the House Judiciary Committee during the first Donald Trump impeachment and co-authored a report for Brookings about Trump's effort to overturn the results in Georgia. ""These appear to be false documents that were submitted to the federal government. They were handed in to the National Archives as the genuine articles are supposed to be.""
The real electoral certificates which were accepted by Congress are on the website of the National Archives. 
Who signed the Trump certificates?
The Trump certificates were signed by well-known Republicans including elected officials and party leaders.
In Arizona, the signers included Dr. Kelli Ward, state Republican Party chair, and her husband, Dr. Michael Ward. It was also signed by James Lamon, who is running for U.S. Senate, and state Rep. Jake Hoffman.
When asked by a reporter why he signed the document, Hoffman said, ""In unprecedented times, unprecedented actions occur,"" and that due to litigation over the election results, he ""felt it appropriate to provide Congress and the vice president with dueling options.""  
In Georgia, fake-certificate signers include state Sen. Burt Jones, who is running for lieutenant governor, and David Shafer, state party chair.
In Michigan, the state GOP co-chair, Meshawn Maddock, was one of the fake electors. Others who signed the Michigan certificate include Amy Facchinello, a Grand Blanc board of education member, and Shelby Township Clerk Stanley Grot.
Wisconsin signers included Andrew Hitt, a lawyer and GOP party chairman at the time, and Wisconsin Elections Commissioner Bob Spindell. Signers in Nevada, Pennsylvania and New Mexico included party officials. In New Mexico, one of the signers, businessman Jewll Powdrell, told the Las Cruces Sun News that he had ""no regrets"" about signing the certificate.
""Now that the election is over, why are we talking about it?"" he asked the reporter, laughing. ""How can you undermine an election that had already been done?"" 
What was the role of the Trump campaign?
Investigators are likely looking at what role Trump's campaign or his lawyers played in the fake electoral certificates. What we know so far comes from news reports and a memo from a Trump ally that shows their scheme to try to pressure Vice President Mike Pence -- who oversaw the electoral vote certification as president of the Senate -- to recognize an alternate slate of electors from some states.
John Eastman, a Trump-allied lawyer, wrote a memo explaining a ""Jan. 6 scenario"" based on the submission of seven dual slates of electors to Pence. Eastman proposed that Pence announce that he had multiple slates of electors and due to ongoing disputes in seven states, no electors from those could be valid. That would have tipped the election to Trump.
The Trump campaign didn't hide this strategy. Stephen Miller, a Trump campaign official, said on Fox News Dec. 14, 2020, that ""as we speak today an alternate slate of electors in the contested states is going to vote and we are going to send those results up to Congress. This will ensure that all of our legal remedies remain open."" 
The Arizona Republic published an investigation in November showing efforts by Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his advisers to get state Republicans to replace the state's 11 electors. Giuliani failed to get Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers to pursue such a path, but ultimately other Republicans signed certificates. 
Meshawn Maddock, one of the Michigan signers, said at a conservative event in January that the Trump campaign was behind the GOP electoral slates, according to audio obtained by CNN.
""We fought to seat the electors,"" she is heard saying. ""The Trump campaign asked us to do that. I'm under a lot of scrutiny for that today.""
How was the effort thwarted?
Pence refused to go along with the plan to overturn the results. On Jan. 6, the day the electoral votes were being certified in Congress, he issued a statement saying that under the Constitution he did not have ""unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not.""
As Pence accepted the results from each state -- a process interrupted by the riot -- he repeatedly described them as what ""the Parliamentarian has advised me is the only certificate of vote from that State that purports to be a return from the state.""
Was the certificates scheme kept secret?
The Trump elector certificates were not created in secret. Republicans held public events or issued statements or social media posts proudly declaring that they were casting electoral votes for Trump, even though they had no authority to do so.
In Arizona, Ward, the GOP state chair, posted a YouTube video in December 2020 stating that ""the true electors for the presidency"" met the day before and voted for Trump and transmitted those results to entities in D.C. for consideration by Congress.
""We believe that we are the electors for the legally cast votes here in Arizona,"" she said.
At the Wisconsin Capitol where Republicans gathered, party chairman Hitt said that they were there ""to preserve our role in the electoral process while the final outcome is still pending in the courts."" 
Nevada Republicans held a press conference to cast their votes for Trump, while in Michigan a group tried to enter the state Capitol, declaring themselves to be the legitimate electors.
Mandell of Law Forward said that after seeing the news coverage he contacted American Oversight to ask if the group could obtain copies of the fake certificates. On Feb. 15, 2021 -- President's Day -- Mandell sent a letter to the Milwaukee district attorney asking for an investigation and also filed a complaint with the Wisconsin Elections Commission.
American Oversight submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the National Archives seeking the unpublished certificates of electoral votes and published the documents on its website on March 2, 2021. 
What happens now?
Federal and state officials, including the Justice Department, have indicated that they are investigating the fake electoral certificates.
Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco told CNN Jan. 25, ""We've received those referrals. Our prosecutors are looking at those and I can't say anything more on ongoing investigations.""
Days later, the Jan. 6 committee announced subpoenas for two Trump electors in each of the seven states.
""We believe the individuals we have subpoenaed today have information about how these so-called alternate electors met and who was behind that scheme,"" wrote U.S. Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, D-Miss., chairman of the committee. 
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, said she handed federal prosecutors the results of a yearlong investigation into the Republicans who signed the certificates in her state. Nessel hasn't ruled out state charges, but described it as a ""conspiracy that occurred between multiple states."" New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas, a Democrat, said he is referring the false certificates to federal law enforcement.  
In Georgia, Fulton County prosecutor Fani Willis' special grand jury is reviewing Trump's efforts to overturn results, including his phone call to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to ""find"" votes to swing the election to him. It's likely that the grand jury will also look at the fake certificate signed by Georgia Republicans.
Milwaukee Assistant District Attorney Matthew Westphal wrote a letter to Mandell saying the state justice department or federal prosecutors are best suited to handle the matter.
Legal experts say that those involved in the phony certificates could face an array of state or federal charges such as mail fraud, forgery or obstruction.
Among the key unanswered questions is what role Trump himself played, Eisen said.
""Did he direct the false certificates to be submitted or did he wink at it? Was he informed about it?"" Eisen said. ""If he was aware, if he was briefed by Mr Guiliani that this was happening and authorized it, then that implicates him in the potential federal crimes.""

019.DidanAnonymous4chanU,"
In early October 2017, a rumor surfaced online alleging that a person using only the name ""john"" on the messaging board 4chan had ""predicted"" the mass shooting in Las Vegas on 1 October 2017.
Police say a 64-year-old gunman opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on a crowd of 22,000 people gathered below for the Route 91 Harvest Festival at 10:05 p.m. on 1 October. The attacker had modified a semi-automatic firearm so that it fired like an automatic, and for roughly ten minutes he sprayed the concert crowd with bullets, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds.
As with many mass casualty incidents in recent history, conspiracy theorists immediately pounced, claiming without proof, for example, that there was a second gunman on the fourth floor of the hotel or that internet sleuths had spotted footage of the shooter at an anti-Trump rally. In keeping with this pattern, conspiracy-minded web sites Neon Nettle and WorldTruth.tv posted identical stories claiming that an anonymous 4chan user predicted the Las Vegas Strip massacre three weeks before it occurred. NeonNettle reported:
The ominous warning was left on the anonymous message boards on the 16th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The user warned people to ""stay away"" from Las Vegas due to a coming deadly attack. The mysterious 4chan user, who went only by the name ""John"", made a series of, at the time, overlooked posts. He warned other users to avoid gatherings of large groups of people in the Vegas or nearby Henderson areas. John claimed to have inside knowledge of, what he referred to as, a ""high incident project"" that was due to take place soon.
The messages posted by ""John"" on either 10 September or 11 September 2017 (depending where you look) don't in fact predict any specific catastrophe -- he only said vaguely that some kind of incident would occur the following day in Las Vegas or Henderson, and that a harbinger of this disaster will be ""three black vans parked next to either.""
According an alleged screen shot and archive of his comments, reposted to 4chan the day after the shooting (with the thread title, ""Anon 'jon' predicted Vegas attack"") the anonymous user issued the warning a day before the 16th anniversary of the 11 September terrorist attack, which could point to a troll trying to drum up fear as the anniversary approached. The user wrote:
look i feel bad for some of you on this website. so i'll let you in on a little secret. if you live in las vegas or henderson stay inside tomorrow. don't go anywhere where there are large groups of people. also if you see three blacks vans parked next to each other immediately leave the area. you're welcome
-john
[...]
it's called the ""high incident project"". they want to make the american public think that places with extremely high security aren't safe. they are trying to create more regulations. you will see laws proposed within the next few years to put up more metal detectors and other security devices. media and politicians will be saying places with lots of police need even more police. i can't guarantee anything will happen tomorrow but las vegas is on their minds.
-john
[...]
if their plan is successful state of nevada will pass a law in the future making all casinos have mandatory metal detectors and backscatter machines. soon after a federal law will be passed to put these machines in universities, high schools, federal buildings, you name it. osi systems and chertoff are the main producers of these machines. sometime around 2020 chertoff and osi will merge into a single company. after they merge the owners will sell off all their stock and make billions in profit. mr chertoff has been in contact with sheldon adelson. mr adelson will become a huge sponsor of these machines and he will be the first to put them in his casinos when the law passes. this is my last message for now. don't expect me to return anytime soon
-john
Although some 4chan users questioned whether the person who wrote the posts was the Las Vegas gunman, others didn't seem impressed at all, saying the user had a habit of regularly posting vague predictions. As one person pointed out, ""Make 1000 predictions a year and a couple will come true."" Another 4chan user noted that the name ""john"" may reference John Titor, a message board hoax from the early 2000s that depicted a time traveling soldier from the future who made bogus predictions about catastrophic events.
We don't know who posted these messages, nor do we know whether the person who did so posts similar messages regularly. They gave the wrong date and didn't refer to any specifics that would point to knowledge predicting the Strip attack. The aspect of the prediction that was correct was the location, but even that was general. Predictably both Neon Nettle and WorldTruth.tv used the posts to support the claim that the attack was a ""false flag"" -- a prevailing conspiracy theory that posits mass casualty incidents are engineered by the government to serve as pretense for heightened security and surveillance, and/or tighter gun control legislation.

232.Bidenconfirmsagendatomicrochipthemasses,"
An old conspiracy theory about vaccines and microchips has resurfaced on Instagram. This time, President-elect Joe Biden is implicated.
A Dec. 9 post shows a video of Biden in 2005, when he was a senator from Delaware. In the clip, Biden asks then-Supreme Court nominee John Roberts about how he'd rule on ""consequential decisions in the 21st century.""
""Can a microscopic tag be implanted in a person's body to track his every movement?"" Biden asks. ""There's actual discussion about that. You will rule on that, mark my words, before your tenure is over.""
The account that posted the video, @endtime.signs, took Biden's line of questioning as proof that the real goal behind the coronavirus vaccine is to implant Americans with microchips.
""This is the greater agenda, and he's known it for years!"" the post's caption says. ""The vaccine that we're currently seeing is simply a stepping stone to the future chip that he mentions here.""
This post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.) The clip has more than 38,000 views.

On Dec. 9, the U.S. set a record for the most COVID-19 deaths in a single day since the pandemic began. As federal regulators deliberate whether to issue emergency use authorization for a vaccine from Pfizer, anti-vaccine misinformation has proliferated on social media.

By Samantha Putterman * June 6, 2022







This Instagram post is the latest example of that misinformation -- the coronavirus vaccine is not part of a plan to track people using microchips. The video shows Biden criticizing the idea of tracking people with microchips, not supporting it.
Back in April, we saw a false claim that Democrats are pushing for everyone to get implanted with microchips via mandatory vaccinations. The notion appeared to stem from an incorrect interpretation of something Microsoft founder Bill Gates said in March about a system for at-home COVID-19 testing.
This video clip of Biden questioning Roberts in 2005 doesn't add any new or relevant information to the false premise. The video was taken out of the larger context of a hearing during which Biden argued that a liberal interpretation of the Constitution was needed to protect the rights of Americans -- particularly their right to privacy.
Here's what he said to Roberts, in context:
""Judge, I do not believe in a Constitution where individuals could for very long have accomplished what we did had we read it in such a narrow way. Like the Founders, I believe our Constitution is as big and as grand and as great as its people. Our constitutional journey did not stop with women being barred from being lawyers, with 10-year-olds working in coal mines, or Black kids forced into different schools than white kids. Just because in the Constitution nowhere does it mention sex discrimination, child labor, segregation -- it doesn't mention it. Our constitutional journey did not stop then, and it must not stop now, judge. And we'll be faced with equally consequential decisions in the 21st century.
Can a microscopic tag be implanted in a person's body to track his every movement? There is actual discussion about that. You will rule on that, mark my words, before your tenure is over. Can brain scans be used to determine whether a person is inclined toward criminality or violent behavior? You will rule on that. And, judge, I need to know whether you will be a justice who believes that the constitutional journey must continue to speak to these consequential decisions, or that we have gone far enough in protecting against government intrusion into our autonomy, into the most personal decisions we make. Judge, that is why this is a critical moment.""
The president-elect has not called for microchipping people who receive the COVID-19 vaccine, and there's no evidence the vaccine is a ""stepping stone"" toward tracking people
The Instagram post is inaccurate and makes a ridiculous claim. We rate it Pants on Fire!

213.GoogleNewsReportedOr,"
In the chaotic aftermath of the 12 June 2016 Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting, a number of rumors and inaccuracies swept across social media. Among them was the claim that a  new syndicate including the Atlanta Sun Times (not the Chicago Sun-Times) had reported news of the massacre several hours ""too early"":
Google Search Engine Picked-Up ORLANDO ATTACK NEWS STORY 6 Hours BEFORE attack took place!
The Google news search engine picked-up an Sun Times Network article about the attack at an Orlando nightclub 6 hours BEFORE the attack took place! The attack occurred around 2:00 AM eastern US time on Sunday, June 12.
But the Atlanta Sun-Times Network has the following story about the attack, dated 06/11/2016, 08:00PM (Double Click Image to enlarge):

The item went on to claim that Google had also displayed the timestamp:
Google's news system is totally automated. It checks thousands of news sites dozens of times a day automatically, and creates a link within Google to news articles, then applies a Google time stamp when the story is acquired by Google (not when the story shows it was published). Google's news system shows that Google picked-up that story BEFORE the attack took place!
As the post indicated, Google automatically populates information from web sites, so it holds that if Atlanta Sun Times incorrectly dated the page, Google would also display that incorrect information. We checked the source code of the page and indeed, the item was listed as published several hours prior to the attack -- in one portion of the code: 







However, that wasn't universally true. While the aggregation of the Atlanta Sun Times' report  was incorrectly timestamped, the original content was clearly not:

The mismatch in timestamps suggested a technical error of some sort, so we contacted the Atlanta Sun Times to ask whether the variation was a glitch or something else. An employee explained to us how the aggregated article (since corrected) ended up misdated:
My apologies for the delay in getting back to you. I wanted to dig into this and get you an accurate answer on the timestamp error. Here's what I discovered:
As you pointed out, the story in question is an aggregation from the Atlanta Journal Constitution. We aggregate content from RSS feeds and through a method called scraping. When we do scrape, we rely on the timestamp of the source article. Sometimes the source article does not include a timezone and by default, our systems assumes and applies a GMT timezone; In this case it resulted in timestamping the aggregated post on our site to the day before the tragedy even took place.
It's a flaw in the system that we are working to correct.
The Orlando shooting was not the first time Superstation95 used a major tragedy to sow additional fear and confusion (which then turn into lucrative pageviews for the site's owner). Superstation95 is a web site that is neither a ""superstation"" nor a legitimate news source, but rather a dumping grounds of misinformation from Hal Turner, a white supremacist who spent 33 months in prison for making death threats against three federal judges in 2009. (The name listed on the site's ""Contact"" page is Turner's lawyer.)
Beginning in late 2015, Superstation95 began spreading alarmist hoaxes and conspiracy theories on social media, often building upon legitimate tragic or frightening events with embellished (and frightening) details. Among the most widely spread were claims that a large group of Muslim men fired upon campers and hikers in California, Fukushima radiation caused severe mutations in marine life, cargo ships mysteriously ground to a halt signaling imminent economic catastrophe, a deadly Las Vegas strip car crash involved a driver shouting ""Allahu Akbar,"" the San Bernardino shooting occurred because the shooter was offended by pork served at a holiday party shortly before the massacre, the Earth's ""magnetosphere"" collapsed for two hours, and a (nonexistent) suicide note left by a genuinely deceased ICE agent warned of impending FEMA camps and mass enslavement. None of Superstation95's tragedy-milking predictions have ever come to fruition.

134.TimelineHowDonaldTru,"
Editor's note: We updated the timeline Jan. 19, 2021.
In the span of one year, Americans went from hearing about a new virus in central China to watching the slow rollout of a vaccine, with only a small percentage of Americans able to access it in the first several weeks. 
In between, they endured months of stay-at-home orders, school and business closures, and requirements to wear masks in many public spaces as the monthly case and death tolls rose.
President Donald Trump went from dismissing the threat of the virus -- publicly at least -- to taking credit when the vaccine was approved for emergency use. Between his Twitter posts, campaign rallies and daily press conferences, Trump became the foremost mouthpiece for the federal government's virus response. But he routinely distorted the facts, and then caught the virus himself as his own White House became a hotspot for infection.
Trump told the nation we were ""rounding the corner"" even as cases continued to rise in the fall. He and his administration overpromised about when Americans could get the vaccine and how fast the rollout would proceed.
The story of Trump and the coronavirus can be broken down into a series of phases: the emergence of the threat; the government's focus on keeping it out of the United States; the flailing effort to contain the spread; Trump's positive test; his return to the campaign trail; his election loss followed by announcements about vaccine trials; and finally emergency use approval of the Pfizer vaccine and Moderna vaccines followed by their rollout to the states.
RELATED: 10 of Trump's big COVID-19 falsehoods
Knowing the facts has never been more important. Please consider donating to PolitiFact today. 
Here are the key moments in each phase, and what Trump said at those times -- fact-checked.
Phase One: The disease emerges
Dec. 31: China confirms existence of a new virus.
Jan. 20: World Health Organization reports cases in China, Thailand, Japan, and South Korea.
Jan. 21: The first U.S. case is announced in Washington state (as well as Vietnam and Singapore). WHO says the virus risk globally is high.
Jan. 22: A reporter asks if there are worries about a pandemic. Trump responds:

""No. Not at all. And we have it totally under control. It's one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It's -- going to be just fine.""

Jan. 24: Trump tweets, ""It will all work out well.""
China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 24, 2020 
Jan 29: The White House forms a coronavirus response task force, initially led by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.
Jan. 30: The WHO declares a global health emergency.
Phase Two: Keeping it out of the United States
Jan. 30: Trump blocks travel from China.
The same night, he holds a campaign rally in Iowa.

""We think we have it very well under control. We have very little problem in this country at this moment -- five. ... we think it's going to have a very good ending for it.""

Feb. 2: Trump tells Fox News host Sean Hannity, ""We pretty much shut it down coming in from China."" 
Feb. 4: Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Yokohama, Japan. Over 2,600 guests and over 1,000 crew. Within two days, over 40 people test positive for COVID-19, including eight Americans.
Feb. 11: WHO names the new disease COVID-19.
Feb 14: Trump discusses the ""very small"" number of U.S. coronavirus cases with  Border Patrol Council members:

""We have a very small number of people in the country, right now, with it. It's like around 12. Many of them are getting better. Some are fully recovered already. So we're in very good shape.""

Feb. 20: WHO reports nearly 77,000 cases worldwide in 27 countries.
Feb. 24: Stock market plummets as Dow Jones Industrials falls more than 1,000 points.
The same day, Trump asks for $1.25 billion in emergency aid. It grows to $8.3 billion in Congress.He tweets that the virus ""is very much under control"" and the stock market ""starting to look very good to me!"" 
The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 24, 2020 
Feb. 26: The first case emerges in California with no clear source, suggesting community spread of the virus.
In a news conference that day, Trump says the United States is ""really prepared."" He puts Vice President Mike Pence in charge of  the White House task force.
Feb. 28: Cases rise across Europe, including Italy, Germany, France, England, Switzerland and Belarus.
Phase Three: Containing the spread
Feb. 29: FDA eases guidelines to speed the broader use of testing.
March 4: House passes $8.3 billion emergency bill, aimed mainly at the immediate health response to the virus. 
In a Fox News interview, Trump deflects criticism to his response by saying the Obama administration (including the vice president, Joe Biden) ""didn't do anything about"" swine flu. We rated the claim False.
Trump continues to blame the Obama administration in an exchange with reporters at the White House. 

""The Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we're doing.""

Our fact-check shows the process dated back to 2006, before Obama took office. So the claim is False. 
March 6: Grand Princess cruise ship with over 2,000 passengers waits to dock off the California coast.
Asked about the docking of the Grand Princess, Trump says the following:

""I would rather (Grand Princess passengers stay aboard) because I like the numbers being where they are. I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship."" 

Trump went on to say that he thought it was more important for passengers to debark than to keep the numbers down.
In a news conference, Trump downplays the concerns around testing:

""Anybody that wants a test can get a test.""

With tests in short supply, we rated the claim Pants on Fire.
The same day, Trump tweets out blame to the media and the Democrats for trying to ""inflame"" the situation ""far beyond what the facts would warrant.""
The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant. Surgeon General, ""The risk is low to the average American.""-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 9, 2020 
March 11: On the same day the WHO declares COVID-19 a pandemic, Trump uses a prime-time Oval Office address to announce a ban on travel for non-Americans from most of Europe. He misstates a freeze on cargo and falsely said the health insurance industry has ""agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments."" In reality, getting tested would be free, but treatment would not be covered. 
March 13: Trump declares a national emergency to access $50 billion for states and territories, and clear the way for fast-track waivers for hospitals and doctors as they respond to the virus.
March 14: The House passes a worker and business relief bill with paid leave guarantees for certain workers, expanded food assistance and unemployment insurance benefits, and employer tax credits. Trump signs it four days later.
March 17: Trump said in a news conference that for the next 14 days, ""we're asking everyone to work at home, if possible, postpone unnecessary travel, and limit social gatherings to no more than 10 people.""
Trump says there was no shift in tone from the White House.

""I've always known this is a real, this is a pandemic. I've felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.""

As this timeline shows, Trump minimized the threat of a pandemic for many weeks. Pants on Fire!
Asked if the World Health Organization had offered detection tests to the United States, Trump said WHO had not, and that the WHO coronavirus test ""was a bad test."" False. WHO said three independent labs had validated the test, and the White House coordinator for coronavirus response said she assumed the WHO test is effective. 
March 19: The U.S. Senate unveils a $1 trillion-plus economic stimulus package. California orders lockdown for 40 million residents. 
March 20-23: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo orders all non-essential businesses to keep their workers home. Indiana, Louisiana, Ohio, Illinois and many other states issue similar restrictions.
March 24: Having tweeted on the economic shutdown that ""we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself,"" Trump says in a Fox News town hall he would ""love to have the country opened up, and just raring to go by Easter.""
Trump responds to a request from Cuomo for ventilators, reading from papers in his hand:

""(He) rejected buying recommended 16,000 ventilators in 2015 for the pandemic, for a pandemic, established death panels and lotteries instead. So, he had a chance to buy, in 2015, 16,000 ventilators at a very low price, and he turned it down.""

False. A state study said that many might be needed in a crisis, but it also said there were immediate pressing health needs, and there was no money to buy that many ventilators.
That evening, Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, tells Fox News that Trump is flexible on economic restrictions: ""The president clearly listens. I mean, he has this aspirational goal of hoping that we might be able to do it by a certain date. We talked with him about that. We say we need to be flexible. He realizes that and he accepts that.""
March 27: Trump signs $2.2 trillion emergency spending bill. The act provides $1,200 per individual and $500 per child for households making up to $150,000 a year. Small businesses are eligible for loans -- that can be forgiven -- from a $377 billion fund. There's a $454 billion fund for companies and state and local governments, and $180 billion for the health care sector. The details for families and small businesses are here. Details for corporations, states and health care, here.
Phase Four: Shifting expectations
March 29: Trump reverses course on relaxing strict stay-at-home guidance by Easter and extends the period to the end of April.
""The peak, the highest point of death rates -- remember this -- is likely to hit in two weeks,"" he said. ""Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory is won. That would be the greatest loss of all.""
In the press conference, he argues with ""PBS NewsHour"" reporter Yamiche Alcindor over what the president had said, or hadn't said, about New York's need for ventilators. Trump falsely denied saying that governors were requesting equipment they didn't need.
March 30: Cases top 163,000. The number of tests crosses the 1 million mark, still behind where the country needs to be. Trump tells Fox News:

""We inherited a broken test"" for COVID-19. 

Trump's impossible claim is Pants on Fire. There could be no test before the new virus emerged. China first confirmed its existence Dec. 31, 2019, and shared its genetic sequence Jan. 7. The CDC's first shipment of tests to states contained tainted reagents. That and bureaucratic delays cost the U.S. several critical weeks in testing. 
March 31: Trump asks Americans to be prepared for the ""hard days that lie ahead.""
""This is going to be a very painful -- very, very painful two weeks,"" he said. ""When you look and see at night the kind of death that's been caused by this invisible enemy, it's -- it's incredible.""
The coronavirus death toll reaches about 3,700.
April 1: Trump talks about keeping the transportation system running.

""They're doing tests on airlines -- very strong tests -- for getting on, getting off. They're doing tests on trains -- getting on, getting off."" 

This confuses screening -- which is happening at only 13 airports and not at any train station -- with testing. Screening involves a temperature check or a questionnaire, and takes place only for people traveling from certain countries. This claim is Pants on Fire. 
April 4: Trump urges use of the drug hydroxychloroquine to fight the virus.

""I hope they use it, because I'll tell you what: What do you have to lose?""

Hospitals are using the drug, but the benefits remain unclear, and the risk of heart damage is well documented. (Doctors in Brazil halted a trial when patients developed irregular heart beats.) Of the two limited tests that suggested it worked, one was later discredited by the scientific society that published it, and efforts to replicate their results failed. See our research round-up here.
April 11: The total number of workers signing up to get unemployment insurance checks reaches nearly 12 million, the highest number (seasonally adjusted) since the government began tracking.
The same day, the United States passes Italy for the most confirmed COVID-19 deaths -- over 20,000.
April 13: Eager to restart the economy, Trump says as president he has ""total"" authority to decide when states lift quarantine rules and other restrictions.
Pants on Fire. Trump overlooked the principle of federalism which reserves certain powers to the states. Legal experts said no part of the Constitution gives the president unlimited power.
Trump also unveiled a White House video summary of progress against the virus. The video used quotes out of context, excluded Trump's comments during the time when he downplayed the crisis, and ended up highlighting the lack of action during the critical month of February.
April 14: Fourth economic rescue bill stalls. Republicans seek additional $250 billion for small businesses. Democrats agree, but also want another $250 billion for hospitals and state and local governments. On April 16, the SBA says it has committed all of the nearly $350 billion small business aid program called the Paycheck Protection Program.
April 16: Trump releases guidelines to restart the economy. 
""To preserve the health of our citizens, we must also preserve the health and functioning of our economy,"" Trump said. He left the decision of whether to relax restrictions in the hands of each state. The guidelines said states should first make sure that the number of cases was headed down.
""If they need to remain closed, we will allow them to do that,"" he said. ""And if they believe it is time to reopen, we will provide them the freedom and guidance to accomplish that task.""
Trump said that while Washington will help with the wide-scale testing required, testing is in the hands of each state. Public health researchers and state officials issued a report saying to be successful, the testing and contact tracing requires ""a new national initiative that combines a massive expansion of rapid diagnostic tests in every community with an unprecedented growth in a public health workforce.""
April 17: Total number of U.S. cases tops 672,000, with nearly 34,000 deaths.

""Supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way ... It sounds interesting.""

April 23: At the regular White House coronavirus briefing, Trump suggests getting disinfectant and light inside the body are interesting possibilities. Experts told us that not only are both approaches ineffective, they can be dangerous.

""You should absolutely open the schools. Our country has got to get back, and it's got to get back as soon as possible. And I don't consider our country coming back if the schools are closed.""

April 29: The Trump administration organized Operation Warp Speed, which aimed to have substantial quantities of a vaccine by January 2021 as well as to develop therapeutics.
May 13: During a meeting with the governors of Colorado and North Dakota, Trump links reopening the economy with reopening schools.
May 29: Trump announces he is terminating relations with the World Health Organization, saying China ""pressured the World Health Organization to mislead the world when the virus was first discovered by Chinese authorities.""
In our fact-check of Trump's claims against WHO and China, we found he ignored actions WHO took to alert the global public health community, and assumed, without evidence, that WHO knew that China was censoring reports of the spread of the disease.

""We're opening, and we're opening with a bang. And we've been talking about the V. This is better than a V; this is a rocket ship.""

June 8: Trump celebrates the recovery of 4.8 million jobs, comparing the coronavirus with a hurricane. ""The hurricane goes away, and within two hours, everyone is rebuilding and fixing and cleaning and cutting their grass,"" Trump said.

COVID-19 cases are ""up only because of our big number testing.""

June 23: As both testing and new cases rise, Trump argued that the first caused the second. But if that were true, the share of tests coming back positive would hold steady or fall. In 12 days, between June 10 and June 22, the positivity rate rose by about 25%. We rated Trump's claim False.

""We have tested over 40 million people. By so doing, we show cases, 99% of which are totally harmless.""

July 4: In his Fourth of July speech in Washington, Trump minimizes the threat of the virus. At the time Trump spoke, based on the number of test-confirmed cases, overall 4.5% of victims had died since the pandemic struck. Daily hospitalizations were at 4% of cases.  We rated this False.

""We have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world.""

July 19: Trump said the United States compared quite favorably with other countries in preventing deaths from the virus. No fewer than 15 advanced, industrialized nations currently have a lower mortality rate, as do a host of other countries, including Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Russia, Turkey, Argentina and India. We rated this False.

""It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better.""

July 21: As cases and deaths surge in states across the South, as well as in Texas, Arizona and California, Trump returned to brief the press on the coronavirus. In a marked shift in tone, he warned that harder times were on the way. Before, Trump had downplayed the need to wear masks. That message changed.
""We're asking everybody that when you are not able to socially distance, wear a mask, get a mask,"" Trump said. ""Whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact.  They'll have an effect. And we need everything we can get.""
Aug. 5: Trump downplayed the chances that children would catch COVID-19 and urged schools to reopen.

""Children are ""almost immune from this disease.""

It's wrong to say children are ""almost immune"" to the virus. Before he spoke, there were cases spread at an overnight camp in the U.S. and at some schools overseas, including in Israel. We rated this statement False. 
Aug. 6: Trump says on Geraldo Rivera's radio show that a vaccine could be available before the end of the year -- or ""right around"" the Nov. 3 election. Trump has repeatedly presented a more rosy picture of the vaccine development timeline than some other government officials. Even if the vaccine is ready before 2021, it's likely that it won't be widely available and will be distributed to certain essential workers or populations first.
Aug. 17: Trump holds a campaign rally in Oshkosh, Wis., an important battleground state that he won in 2016, and dismisses the fact that the U.S. has more cases and deaths than any other country:

""We're coming back and our numbers are better than almost all countries.""

The White House pointed to one number to back that up -- the number of deaths relative to the number of known cases. But by other yardsticks, the United States was doing worse than many countries, including a higher death rate in relation to its population, and the test positivity rate. We rated this sweeping claim False.
Sept. 1: As the U.S. reaches the 6 million mark for confirmed cases, Trump boosts a conspiracy theory about the CDC's coronavirus death toll, first on Twitter and then on Fox News on Laura Ingraham's show.

""Only 6% of the people actually died from COVID.""

Pants on Fire! Trump misconstrued data on coronavirus deaths. A National Center for Health Statistics report found that, for about 6% of Americans who die from the virus, COVID-19 is the only condition listed on their death certificates. But that doesn't mean the remaining 94% didn't die due to the coronavirus. Officials said COVID-19 is the underlying cause of death for most victims. 
Sept. 7: Speaking at the White House on Labor Day, Trump hinted again that he thought we may have a vaccine by Election Day: ""So we're going to have a vaccine very soon, maybe even before a very special date. You know what date I'm talking about."" Two days later at a Senate panel hearing, federal health officials expressed caution about that timeline.
Sept. 9: Investigative reporter Bob Woodward's new book about Trump entitled ""Rage"" is released early to some media outlets. The Washington Post posts audio from Woodward's March 19 interview with Trump in which the presdient said of his early COVID-19 response:

""To be honest with you, I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down, because I don't want to create a panic.""

Sept 12: At a rally in Minden, Nev., Trump said Biden is ""in his damn basement again"" -- a frequent attack line. But the claim is False. Biden held multiple events in various states in September.
Sept. 13: About 5,600 supporters gathered to hear Trump speak at Xtreme Manufacturing, a warehouse, in Henderson, Nev., despite a state rule prohibiting gatherings of more than 50 people. Many people in the crowd were not wearing masks. Trump again talks up the timeline for a vaccine and promises ""we will very easily defeat the China virus. That's what's happening."" 
Sept. 15: Trump takes questions in a town hall with voters on ABC News, repeating many false and misleading claims.  
Sept. 17, 18, 19: Trump continues to hold in-person rallies, including in Mosinee, Wis., Bemidji, Minn., and Fayetteville, N.C. 
Sept. 22: The U.S. surpasses 200,000 COVID-19 deaths.
Sept. 24: At a Jacksonville, Fla., rally, Trump speaks optimistically about a future return to normal life. ""We're rounding the third. We're rounding the turn. Under my leadership, prosperity will surge. Normal life, oh, I love normal life. We want to get back to normal life. We'll fully resume. The Florida tourism and hospitality industries will reach record highs.""
Sept. 26: Trump nominates Judge Amy Coney Barrett to fill an opening on the U.S. Supreme Court. The ceremony is held in the Rose Garden, with few masks and no social distancing between seats in the crowd. 
That night, at a rally in Middletown, Pa., Trump praised his administration's response: ""And to fight the China virus, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. You know they said, 'How did you do?' I say we get an A plus, but I get a D in public relations because we were so busy working and you know when you give it to the fake news, they reported incorrectly.""
Sept. 29: Trump and Biden faced off in Cleveland for the first debate, moderated by Chris Wallace. Trump repeats false or misleading claims about his rallies and Dr. Anthony Fauci's early comments on the general public wearing masks. 

Some of the guests or officials in attendance at Barrett's ceremony later test positive for the coronavirus.
Phase Five: A presidential positive test and hospitalization 
Oct. 1: One of Trump's closest aides, Hope Hicks, tests positive for the coronavirus. Trump confirms her results to Sean Hannity of Fox News and says he and wife Melania were tested for the virus due to their close proximity to Hicks. Trump talks about how hard it is for Hicks and others to keep their distance from law enforcement and members of the military ""who want to hug you and they want to kiss you because we really have done a good job for them.""
""You can't just say, 'Stay away, stay away,'"" Trump said.
Oct. 2: Hours later, Trump sends an historic tweet: He and Melania tested positive. The tweet is posted at 12:54 a.m. ET.

""Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!""

The quarantine halts Trump's usual campaign rallies, including a planned stop in the battleground of Florida. Melania Trump tweets that they are ""feeling good,"" but no further information is released about their symptoms and condition.

That night, Trump is moved by helicopter to Walter Reed Medical Center. In an 18-second Twitter video posted that night, Trump said, ""I think I am doing very well but we are going to make sure that things work out.""
Oct. 3: Trump tweets another video update from Walter Reed: ""I think I will be back soon. I look forward to finishing up the campaign the way it was started .... We are going to beat this coronavirus or whatever you want to call it. .... I'm starting to feel good."" 
Oct. 4: Trump takes a short car ride with the Secret Service so he can wave to supporters outside Walter Reed. ""It's been a very interesting journey,"" Trump said from Walter Reed. 

""I learned a lot about COVID. I learned it by really going to school. This is the real school. This isn't the 'let's read the book' school. And I get it. And I understand it. And it's a very interesting thing. And I'm going to be letting you know about it.""

Oct. 5: White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany announces that she tested positive, the latest in Trump's circle of advisers and contacts to test positive.
Trump announces in a tweet he will leave the hospital that night, and he does.

""Don't be afraid of COVID. Don't let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge. I feel better than I did 20 years ago!""

Phase Six: Trump resumes campaigning following his covid diagnosis
Oct. 10: Trump gives a speech from the White House balcony to a gathering of supporters that dubs a peaceful protest for law and order. Trump spoke for an uncharacteristically short 17 minutes. 
Oct. 12-Nov. 2: Trump returns to the campaign trail to hold rallies in Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Iowa, North Carolina, Georgia, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada, Ohio and Nebraska. At a campaign rally in Michigan Oct. 30, Trump said that doctors inflate the number of COVID-19 deaths to ""get more money."" There is no evidence to back this up. Doctors and coroners follow established guidelines on the cause of death, and false reporting is a crime.
Oct. 15: At an NBC town hall, Trump repeated a number of falsehoods and exaggerations about the state of the crisis, the efficacy of face masks and pandemic-driven immigration restrictions. Trump repeated a false characterization of a small survey when he said ""just the other day, they came out with a statement that 85% of the people that wear masks catch it.""
Oct 16: States are required by this date to submit their first plans to distribute the vaccine, even though they face several unknowns, including when the vaccine will arrive, how many doses they will get, and how much money they will get to cover distribution costs.

""We are rounding the turn"" on coronavirus. ""We are rounding the corner."" 

Oct. 22: During a debate with Biden, Trump says, ""We are rounding the corner"" on the coronavirus. That statement was false. At the time, cases had been rising steadily since mid-September, hospitalizations had been rising for almost two weeks, and positivity rates had been rising since the end of September.
Oct. 27: Trump continues to express frustration that COVID-19 is a major news topic. He tweets: ""ALL THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA WANTS TO TALK ABOUT IS COVID, COVID, COVID. ON NOVEMBER 4th, YOU WON'T BE HEARING SO MUCH ABOUT IT ANYMORE. WE ARE ROUNDING THE TURN!!!""
Phase Seven: Trump loses the election, and vaccine makers announce initial results 
Nov. 3: Election Day. The following day in a White House speech, Trump prematurely declared victory. On Nov. 7, every major television network and the Associated Press called the presidential race for Biden when he passed the required 270 electoral votes. During the next month, Trump and his allies will file dozens of lawsuits in a flailing effort to overturn the election.
Nov. 9: As the U.S. surpasses 10 million cases, Pfizer and its partner BioNTech announce that an early analysis of clinical trial data found that inoculated individuals experienced 90% fewer cases of symptomatic COVID-19 than those who had received a placebo. Trump accuses the company of sitting on the results until after the election.
Nov. 16: Moderna announces that its vaccine was 95% effective at preventing the disease, according to an early analysis of clinical trial data. Trump continues to take credit for vaccine development and days later says if it wasn't for him, it would have taken years.

""Joe Biden was a total disaster in handling the H1N1 Swine Flu, would never have produced a Vaccine in record time (years ahead of schedule), and would do a terrible job of Vaccine delivery - But doesn't everybody already know that!""

Nov. 23: The General Services Administration sends a letter to Biden officially starting the transition. Before that, Trump and his administration blocked such efforts, preventing Biden officials from meeting with top Trump officials about COVID-19 vaccine and related efforts. 
 
Phase Eight: The FDA approves emergency use of the first vaccine
Dec. 2: At an Operation Warp Speed briefing, federal officials indicate a fast-paced vaccine rollout is coming.
""We will be able to distribute enough vaccine to immunize 20 million people in the U.S. in December -- that's 40 million doses -- and 30 million people, 60 million doses in January,"" says Moncef Slaoui, the Trump-appointed chief adviser to Operation Warp Speed.
Dec. 8: U.S. surpasses 15 million COVID-19 cases. At his Operation Warp Speed summit, Trump promises a quick vaccine rollout. ""If authorized, tens of millions of vaccine doses will be available this month and we'll get it distributed very quickly. We have that all set and hundreds of millions more will quickly follow. Every American who wants the vaccine will be able to get the vaccine. And we think by spring, we're going to be in a position that nobody would have believed possible just a few months ago. Amazing, really amazing. They say it's somewhat of a miracle. And I think that's true.""
Trump calls on governors to first vaccinate seniors and people in health care who work with seniors. ""This will quickly and dramatically reduce deaths and hospitalizations. And within a short period of time, I think we want to get back to normal.""
Dec. 10: An advisory panel recommends that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration grant emergency use authorization for the Pfizer vaccine.
Trump calls the FDA ""a big, old, slow turtle. Get the dam vaccines out NOW, Dr. Hahn @SteveFDA. Stop playing games and start saving lives!!!"" 
Dec. 11: The FDA grants emergency use authorization for the Pfizer vaccine for people age 16 and up. Trump announced at the White House:

""I have really good news. Today, our nation has achieved a medical miracle. We have delivered a safe and effective vaccine in just nine months. This is one of the greatest scientific accomplishments in history. It will save millions of lives, and soon end the pandemic once and for all. I am thrilled to report that the FDA has authorized the Pfizer vaccine.""

Dec. 13: Virus shipment begins. About 2.9 million doses are expected to be sent to states, mostly starting at large hospitals, this week.
Dec. 14: Health workers at high risk of becoming infected begin receiving the shots. 
Dec. 18: The FDA grants emergency use authorization to allow the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to be distributed in the U.S. for adults.
Dec. 27: Trump signs a $900 billion COVID-19 relief bill, after criticizing it because he said he wanted higher cash payments to taxpayers. ""I will sign the Omnibus and COVID package with a strong message that makes clear to Congress that wasteful items need to be removed,"" Trump says in a written statement.
Dec. 30: News reports show  the vaccine rollout to be progressing slowly in the states. ""The Federal Government has distributed the vaccines to the states. Now it is up to the states to administer. Get moving!"" Trump tweets.
Jan. 3, 2021: Trump criticizes the CDC's COVID-19 death count in a tweet: ""The number of cases and deaths of the China Virus is far exaggerated in the United States because of @CDCgov's ridiculous method of determination compared to other countries, many of whom report, purposely, very inaccurately and low.

'When in doubt, call it Covid.' Fake News!

Fauci disputes Trump's account. ""Well, the deaths are real deaths,"" Fauci says on ABC's ""This Week."" ""All you need to do is to go out into the trenches, go to the hospitals, see what the health care workers are dealing with. They are under very stressed situations in many areas of the country. The hospital beds are stretched. People are running out of beds, running out of trained personnel, who are exhausted right now. That's real. That's not fake. That's real.""
Jan. 12: The Trump administration announces it will release the federal government's entire vaccine stockpile to the states, rather than holding supplies in reserve for second doses. Days later, the Washington Post reports that at the time of the announcement, all supplies had already been released, and no such stockpile existed.
Jan. 13: Trump is impeached for the second time, one week after his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol while both houses of Congress were in session to certify election results. The articles of impeachment said Trump incited the crowd and endangered the security of the United States. Trump said in a video statement: ""Tragically, over the course of the past year made so difficult because of COVID-19, we have seen political violence spiral out of control. We have seen too many riots, too many mobs, too many acts of intimidation and destruction. It must stop."" 
Jan. 19: By Trump's final full day in office, the U.S. had recorded a total of 24 million COVID-19 cases and almost 400,000 deaths. About 14 million Americans have received a shot, said Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.

309.MondexBiochips,"
Claim:   Mondex is planning to replace money with biochips embedded in people's heads and hands. 
Status:   False.
Origins:   March 2004 saw the latest iteration of a form of conspiracy theory that attempts to tie automated systems related to financial transactions to the ""mark of the beast"" prophesied in Chapter 13 of the New Testament's book of Revelation:


[The beast] causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads.
And that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666.


In earlier days conspiratorial rumors linked this bit of scripture to the advent of  bar codes on product packaging; now a much-circulated 18-slide PowerPoint presentation earnestly tries to associate it with Mondex, a brand of ""smart card"" technology, by misleadingly equating smart cards with implantable identification technology. 








Our conspiracy train has already jumped the track by the third slide, which conflates two distinctly different types of technology.
The device pictured above is a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip (also known as an ""ID chip""), used (among other purposes) to assist retailers with Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC).  Described as ""bar codes on steroids,"" tiny RFID chips can be embedded in products (or their packaging); when triggered by sensors, these chips emit short bursts of identifying data streamed via radio waves (or ""RF"").  This system offers a significant improvement over the current bar coding system for a number of reasons, including: 

 RFID chips can store much more information than bar codes.
 RFID chips are a read/write technology, so more information can be added to them as needed.
 RFID chips don't require line-of-sight proximity (i.e., the information they store can be read even when products are still encased in boxes or crates). 
 RFID technology can be used to scan items in groups rather than one-at-a-time.  (For example, a grocery store checker could scan an entire shopping cart full of items all at once rather than having to run each item past a scanner individually.)
 RFID chips can enable the tracking of individual pieces of merchandise. (That is, a retailer could track not only that his store sold six cans of XYZ brand beans on Wednesday, he could track exactly which six cans were sold that day, information that might prove helpful if a recall order were issued for cans originating from a particular lot.)
 RFID chips are more robust (i.e., not subject to problems caused by tearing, creasing, or alteration) than bar coding.

Other uses for RFID chips have included implanting them in pets to help identify the owners should the animals become lost (a collar and tag can too easily come loose or be removed), or implanting them in humans to encode vital information that emergency medical personnel might need to know when treating a patient who is unconscious or unable to speak.
(Technically, a biochip is a computer chip made from organic molecules rather than from silicon or germanium.  The term ""biochip"" is also used more generally to refer to any type of chip implanted in living beings, but RFID is only one of many technologies that might be used in such a chip. Kevin Warwick, a Professor of Cybernetics at Reading University, made news in 2000 when he had a silicon chip transponder surgically implanted in his arm.) 






The concept described in the text accompanying this photo, however, describes a different type of technology: the smart card.

Almost every credit card issued nowadays includes a magnetic stripe which encodes information about the card that can be read when the card is swiped through an electronic card reader.  (In most cases the information encoded is merely a repetition of the account number and expiration date embossed on the card, allowing the card to be more easily read by electronic scanning devices.)  The smart card technology takes that concept further by replacing the magnetic stripe with a tiny microprocessor embedded in the card. The microprocessor can store information that might be used for a variety of purposes, such as identifying that the bearer of the card is its authorized user, providing basic personal data (e.g., name, address, phone number) to free consumers from the necessity of filling out repetitious forms, or providing important background information about a patient to medical personnel.  (Smart cards also have the advantage of being ""contact-less"" -- they can transmit data by RF instead of having to be physically swiped through readers.)
Another envisioned use for smart cards is in electronic payment schemes.  Rather than carrying around currency and coins, consumers could use smart cards that would be able to tap into centralized systems which keep track of how much each person has available to spend.  The purchase price would be automatically deducted from the buyer's account at the point of sale, conceivably eliminating the need for money altogether someday.

Here the text goes even further astray in an erroneous attempt to tie smart card technology to specifics of the Biblical prophecy found in Revelation 13:16 and 13:17:


[The beast] also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name.


First of all, smart card technology involves microprocessors embedded in cards, not people.  Secondly, the uses of biochips in humans and other animals for identification purposes do not involve implanting such chips in the head or the hands.  The preferred location for such chips is an out-of-the-way fleshy area that will allow for tissue to bond the chip and lessen the possibility of any irritation or discomfort to the host, making the head and hands (too bony and exposed) non-ideal for such purposes.  The recommended implantation location for biochips is between the shoulderblades, towards the back of the upper arm (or on the back between the front legs of a dog or cat). 








The statements included in the last slide above are all misleading or inaccurate:

 Motorola is one of the companies invested in producing smart card technology, but they're far from the only ones.
 Motorola also produces biochips, but associating that fact with Mondex is misleading. Mondex is a brand of smart card technology, not a type of biochip.
 A transponder is a radio or radar transmitter/receiver activated for transmission by the reception of a predetermined signal.  It isn't technically a ""system of storage,"" other than in the sense that the response transmitted upon reception of the predetermined signal is ""stored"" within the responding device.
 The RFID technology currently used in applications such as merchandise tracking or human/pet identification doesn't involve chips with stored batteries; it uses a passive system in which the power for transmitting the information stored within a chip is provided by the scanning device itself.



 






MasterCard did acquire a 51% stake in London-based Mondex International in 1996, and they have been trying to establish a variety of Mondex-based applications in a number of countries in recent years.  However, attempts to launch the use of Mondex smart cards as ""electronic purse"" alternatives to cash over the past decade have so far been disappointingly unsuccessful, as this October 2003 news account of a Mondex test launch in the UK illustrates:


A number of electronic payment schemes have been launched in the past decade but many have languished because they have not found resonance with consumers. The Mondex card was launched in the UK in 1995 by a consortium of banks and BT, the telecommunications group. It looks like a credit card and contains a chip that can be ""loaded"" with cash from a bank account. It was seen as as ideal for small purchases such as newspapers and rounds of drinks in pubs. It was introduced in Swindon in 1994 and then on university campuses at Exeter, Edinburgh and Nottingham. But in spite of trials in about 20 countries, Mondex has hardly got beyond the test stage.





Again, Mondex is a smart card technology, not a biochip technology.  Mondex has nothing to do with implanting chips into people, nor are biochips inserted into heads or hands.  This bugaboo about heads and hands is just a silly attempt to tie this Mondex screed to the mention of ""foreheads"" and ""right hand"" found in the portion of Revelation 13 quoted above.


Once again, Mondex is not a biochip technology -- it is a brand of smart card technology (which uses chips produced by other companies), and the Mondex card itself was introduced at least ten years ago.  Neither MasterCard nor Mondex has reported problems with smart card fraud or announced plans to insert smart card chips into human beings rather than place them within cards because otherwise the ""chip could be cut and the information would be changed or falsified.""  (Extracting an implanted chip from a human being isn't really prohibitively more difficult than removing one from a plastic card, certainly not enough to absolutely prevent dedicated criminals from pulling it off.)

Now we've zoomed into the area of the nonsensical.  Even if we were to contemplate implanting the chips utilized in ""smart card"" technology into human beings, locating them in the head or the right hand wouldn't make them any more difficult or impossible to remove than locating them elsewhere in the body.  (Again, this is a rather silly attempt to tie ""Mondex"" to the prophecy of Revelation 13.)  Current RFID chip technology does not use lithium-based batteries, nor does it encompass tracking via a Global Positioning System (GPS).  (As the RFID FAQ notes,  in ""battery-less transponders, long read range and small size are mutually exclusive,"" and thus the read range of most RFID tracking chips is currently limited to less than three feet.)
The name Mondex, of course, is derived from ""monde,"" the French word for ""world.""


Well hey, there's nothing we take more ""serious"" than bad grammar or an exhortation to forward a nonsensical message to everyone we know.

VeriChip is one of many companies that produces implantable identification technology, but they really have nothing to do with smart cards in general or the Mondex brand of smart card in particular (other than that they have overlapping areas of interest in systems for personal identification and guaranteeing the integrity of financial transactions).

35.DidaFloridaSheriffsD,"
Conservative blogs attempted to seize on the death of a sheriff's deputy in Broward County, Florida, in April 2018 as a way to promote conspiracy theories regarding ""questions"" about the mass school shooting attack there two months earlier.
Many of the blogs invoved cited a story by Memory Hole Blog promoting the idea that a ""media blackout"" had taken place concerning Deputy Jason Fitzsimons' death. What set Fitzsimons apart from other recently deceased persons, the blog suggested, was that the deputy ""took to social media to question the potential agenda"" behind the assault at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, a mass shooting that resulted in the deaths of 17 people and spurred an uptick in gun safety protests around the U.S. 
That suggestion was based on a social media post by Fitzsimons depicting one of the high school's students, David Hogg, in a Nazi uniform: 

According to the Memory Hole Blog, that post and all of Fitzsimons' other social posts from 2018 had been ""scrubbed"":
As is suggested in the aftermath of other recent mass shooting events, Fitzsimons simply may have possessed too much information, was at the wrong place at the wrong time, and/or asking sensitive questions of his peers and superiors on the specifics of the Parkland shooting. It is beyond dispute that the sheriff's deputy had become uncomfortably outspoken on the February 14 event. 






Other conservative blogs picked up the story, with one saying that Fitsimons had ""exposed"" a conspiracy:

But these blogs did not mention Memory Hole's follow-up story, which noted that Fitzsimons had used several different Facebook accounts, and that the account featuring the post criticizing Hogg had not been ""scrubbed"" and was accessible online at press time.
Also, Fitzsimons didn't ""expose"" anything about the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School -- he merely posted criticisms of number of persons associated with that event on social media, primarily David Hogg.
A spokesperson for the Broward County Sheriff's Department told us that they did not consider Fitzsimons' death to be suspicious. The spokesperson confirmed to us that detectives were aware of Fitzsimons' controversial social media post about Hogg, adding, ""It has nothing to do with his death.""  
The Broward County Medical Examiner's office determined that Fitzsimons' death was an accident, and attributed it to the ""combined toxic effects of hydrocodone, alprazolam, dextromethorphan, and doxylamine.""
According to the autopsy, Fitzsimons' girlfriend called emergency responders after finding him ""unresponsive on his sofa."" He was declared dead at the scene.

Since the Parkland shooting, Hogg has been the target of a series of smears promoted by far-right blogs attempting to discredit him and his activist efforts for gun safety. Mike Adams, the founder of an ""alternative health"" blog, went so far as to found an entirely new site devoted to labeling Hogg a ""fascist,"" among other pejoratives.

21.WEFfounderKlausSchwabhasnotbeenarrested,"
Articles circulating on Facebook claim that Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum (WEF), has been arrested by police in Switzerland. 
The articles make vague allegations surrounding the supposed arrest, with one suggesting that it is in connection with Covid-related fraud and another alluding to a ""crime that he committed during the phase of Covid-19 outbreak"". 
Several other fact checking services have investigated these claims and found them to be false. 
Melanie Lourenco, a spokesperson for the Swiss federal police, told AFP: ""We confirm that Klaus Schwab was not arrested by the Swiss police.""
Jean-Philippe Brandt, spokesperson for police in Geneva, also told AFP: ""This is fake news.""
Besides this, Full Fact could find no evidence that Mr Schwab's supposed arrest had been reported by any mainstream media outlet. The Swiss police has not released any press releases regarding Mr Schwab, nor has the WEF. 
As the chief executive of the WEF, which is known for holding an annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Mr Schwab has written about the need for a 'Great Reset' following the pandemic, which involves calling for a major overhaul to the world economy. 
The 'Great Reset' has become a feature of a number of conspiracy theories about the Covid-19 pandemic, which we have written about before.

Military tribunals come up in the QAnon conspiracy theory, which maintains without evidence that powerful cabal of politicians and celebrities run a global child sex trafficking ring. In the video in this post, the woman speaking refers to the cabal and makes other comments that sound rooted in QAnon. 
But there's nothing to corroborate the claim that former President Bill Clinton, former Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and Colin Powell, and Hunter Biden, son of the president, have been subject to military tribunals.

304.ThirdpartyvotesonlysiphonfromDemocrats,"
The sudden and unusual emergence of rapper Kanye West as a potential presidential candidate has sparked questions on what kind of impact the mercurial entertainer could have at the ballot box.
The questions -- and conspiracy theories -- only gained traction when we learned the attorney who submitted West's signatures for Wisconsin (minutes after the technical deadline) was a former GOP lawyer who is representing Trump's campaign in a pending lawsuit.
One widely-read post on Instagram claimed West joining the race would help Trump -- citing past elections as supposed proof.
""Third party votes only siphon from dems for a candidate with no chance of winning,"" said the Aug. 6, 2020 post.
The post went on to show a breakdown of total votes cast in Wisconsin from the 2016 election, noting Green Party candidate Jill Stein won more votes here than Republican Donald Trump's margin of victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton.
But a review of past elections shows this claim is nonsense.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook and Instagram's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership.)
Here's what we found.
Illogical post
For starters, the evidence listed by the post isn't evidence at all. It simply reports the vote totals for Trump, Clinton, Stein and Libertarian Gary Johnson.
Clinton lost Wisconsin by 22,748 votes, while Stein accumulated 31,072, according to the Wisconsin Election Commission. But this would only be evidence if every Stein voter had voted for Clinton instead, a claim the post doesn't make and that experts say is not true.
And this line of thinking ignores that Johnson pulled a far larger vote share -- 106,674 -- and Libertarians have historically drawn more voters from the Republican side.
""This idea that categorically minority parties draw from Democratic voters is just absurd,"" said Christopher Devine, assistant professor of political science at the University of Dayton, whose study on the 2016 third-party candidates is currently going through peer review.
Barry Burden, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, agreed.
""Every minor party or independent candidate who has run in modern history has taken some votes from (both parties),"" said Burden, who has authored numerous studies on the impact of third-party candidates. ""It's also incorrect to say the votes come even disproportionately from a Democratic candidate.""

Recent third-party impact
To be sure, some third-party candidates have swung races to Democrats, most notably the 2000 election where Ralph Nader's presence pulled votes that could have swung Florida -- and ultimately the country -- in favor of Al Gore instead of George W. Bush.
But the impact in other recent elections has varied, according to experts and an array of studies. The impact depended on the specific background of the third-party candidate.
In the 2016 election, voters who backed Johnson or Stein would have leaned toward Trump if forced to choose in a two-way race, according to a survey by international research group YouGov. Among likely voters, 34% preferred Trump, 25% preferred Clinton and 42% said they had no preference.
The Washington Post cited exit polls in reporting Johnson likely moved the final margin about 0.4% in Trump's favor. And a study from Devine going through peer review found Johnson voters would have favored Trump by a 2-to-1 margin in a two-person race.
Nader in 2000 is the most prominent example of third-party impact given the historically tiny margin deciding that election. Florida's outcome determined the presidency, and Bush topped Gore there by a mere 537 votes.
Nader received 97,488 votes in Florida. And national exit polling showed Nader voters would have chosen Gore (47%) over Bush (21%) in a two-man race. A book by Burden estimated a similar breakdown.
The highest-polling third-party candidate in recent history was Ross Perot, who ran in 1992 and 1996. He drew support from both parties, but a study by Burden found 36% of Perot voters would have backed George H.W. Bush with Perot out of the 1992 race, while 44% would have supported Bill Clinton. About 20% would not have voted.
Devine noted that Libertarians, the most prominent and successful third-party in recent decades, have nominated a slate of former Republican politicians, and ""clearly it has tended to draw more from Republicans over the years.""
Projecting the Kanye effect
The trickier question is what impact West could have on the 2020 race if he does make it on the ballot in Wisconsin or anywhere else.
West has previously supported Trump -- including donning a ""Make America Great Again"" hat -- but he's such an unusual candidate experts say it's too early to say much for sure.
A July 2020 poll found Biden leading Trump 48% to 40% if West wasn't mentioned. But if West was included as a potential candidate in the poll question, Biden remained at 48% while Trump dropped a point to 39%.
""He has a kind of unorthodox and muddled set of things he would do in office, so it's not a clear ideological thing he has to offer,"" Burden said. ""He's more progressive in some issues, but he's also pro-life apparently and in favor of private schools to some degree, things Democrats wouldn't normally go for. I think he would appeal to a real hodgepodge of voters.""
Our ruling
Addressing the potential addition of West in the 2020 race, an Instagram post claimed ""Third party votes only siphon from dems for a candidate with no chance of winning.""
There have been prominent examples of Democrats losing votes, most notably Nader in 2000. But experts are unanimous in noting this is not remotely true as a hard-and-fast-rule.
The 2016 election even disproves this claim, with far more third-party voters favoring Trump over Clinton.
We rate this claim False.

.AlexJonesOrderedtoPa,"
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A Texas jury ordered conspiracy theorist Alex Jones to pay more than $4 million in compensatory damages to the parents of a 6-year-old boy who was killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, marking the first time the Infowars host has been held financially liable for repeatedly claiming the deadliest school shooting in U.S. history was a hoax.
The Austin jury must still decide how much the Infowars host must pay in punitive damages to Neil Heslin and Scarlett Lewis, whose son Jesse Lewis was among the 20 children and six educators who were killed in the 2012 attack in Newtown, Connecticut.
The parents had sought at least $150 million in compensation for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Jones' attorney asked the jury to limit damages to $8 -- one dollar for each of the compensation charges they are considering -- and Jones himself said any award over $2 million ""would sink us.""
It likely won't be the last judgment against Jones -- who was not in the courtroom -- over his claims that the attack was staged in the interests of increasing gun controls. A Connecticut judge has ruled against him in a similar lawsuit brought by other victims' families and an FBI agent who worked on the case.
Jones' lead attorney, Andino Reynal, winked at his co-counsel before leaving the courtroom. He declined to comment on the verdict. 






Outside the courthouse, the plaintiffs' attorney Mark Bankston insisted that the $4.11 million amount wasn't a disappointment, noting it was only part of the damages Jones will have to pay.
The jury returns Friday to hear more evidence about Jones and his company's finances.
""We aren't done folks,"" Bankston said. ""We knew coming into this case it was necessary to shoot for the moon to get the jury to understand we were serious and passionate. After tomorrow, he's going to owe a lot more.""
The total amount awarded in this case could set a marker for the other lawsuits against Jones and underlines the financial threat he's facing. It also raises new questions about the ability of Infowars -- which has been banned from YouTube, Spotify and Twitter for hate speech -- to continue operating, although the company's finances remain unclear.
Jones, who has portrayed the lawsuit as an attack on his First Amendment rights, conceded during the trial that the attack was ""100% real"" and that he was wrong to have lied about it. But Heslin and Lewis told jurors that an apology wouldn't suffice and called on them to make Jones pay for the years of suffering he has put them and other Sandy Hook families through.
The parents testified Tuesday about how they've endured a decade of trauma, inflicted first by the murder of their son and what followed: gun shots fired at a home, online and phone threats, and harassment on the street by strangers. They said the threats and harassment were all fueled by Jones and his conspiracy theory spread to his followers via his website Infowars.
A forensic psychiatrist testified that the parents suffer from ""complex post-traumatic stress disorder"" inflicted by ongoing trauma, similar to what might be experienced by a soldier at war or a child abuse victim.
At one point in her testimony, Lewis looked directly at Jones, who was sitting barely 10 feet away. 






""It seems so incredible to me that we have to do this -- that we have to implore you, to punish you -- to get you to stop lying,"" Lewis told Jones.
Barry Covert, a Buffalo, New York, First Amendment lawyer, said the $4 million in compensatory damages was lower than he would have expected given the evidence and testimony.
""But I don't think Jones can take this as a victory,"" he added. ""The fact is, $4 million is significant even if we might have thought it would be a little higher.""
Jurors often decline to award any punitive damages when deciding on a compensation figure. But when they choose to, the punitive amount is often higher, Covert said. He said he expects the parents' attorneys to argue that jurors should send the message that no one should profit off defamation.
""They will want jurors to send the message that you can't make a quarter of a billion in profit off harming someone and say you'll just take the damages loss in court,"" Covert said.
Jones was the only witness to testify in his defense. And he came under withering attack from the plaintiffs attorneys under cross-examination, as they reviewed Jones' own video claims about Sandy Hook over the years, and accused him of lying and trying to hide evidence, including text messages and emails about the attack. It also included internal emails sent by an Infowars employee that said ""this Sandy Hook stuff is killing us.""
At one point, Jones was told that his attorneys had mistakenly sent Bankston the last two years' worth of texts from Jones' cellphone. Bankston said in court Thursday that the U.S. House Jan. 6 committee investigating the 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol has requested the records and that he intends to comply.
And shortly after Jones declared ""I don't use email,"" Jones was shown one that came from his address, and another one from an Infowars business officer telling Jones that the company had earned $800,000 gross in selling its products in a single day, which would amount to nearly $300 million in a year.
Jones' media company Free Speech Systems, which is Infowars' parent company, filed for bankruptcy during the two-week trial.

74.ZelenskyandSorosAren,"



Quick Take
Conspiracy theories aimed at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have been circulating on social media since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. One recent example, falsely attributed to a ""Pentagon official,"" is the unfounded claim that Zelensky is the cousin of billionaire philanthropist George Soros.

Full Story
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, 44, and Hungarian-American philanthropist George Soros, 91, are not cousins. But an unsubstantiated claim that they are cousins has been spreading on social media.
A Twitter account using the handle @ASBmilitari posted the claim on April 5, saying: ""BREAKING: Volodymyr Zelensky is a cousin of George Soros. Pentagon official says.""
The account was created on March 26, shortly after an account with the handle @ASBmilitary -- which had almost 200,000 followers and claimed to be the ""#1 Source of Breaking Military News"" about Russia and others -- was suspended after it spread a conspiracy theory about bioweapons labs in Ukraine. We've addressed similar claims before.
The claim about Zelensky and Soros was quickly repeated by other Twitter accounts and migrated as a screenshot meme to Facebook.
None of the accounts that have posted the claim have offered supporting evidence. Instead, they attribute the claim to an unnamed ""Pentagon official.""
But no Pentagon official has made that statement, a Department of Defense spokesperson confirmed to us by email.
We also reached out to Soros' philanthropic organization, Open Society Foundations, for comment on the claim. A spokesperson told us by email, ""The allegation that George Soros is related to somebody making news, in this case Ukraine's president, has been the basis for many conspiracy theories in the past. This current one, just like those that came before it, is false.""
Indeed, over the last five years, we're debunked claims that Soros, a major Democratic donor, has had some kind of familial or personal relationship with Rep. Adam Schiff, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, climate activist Greta Thunberg and Christine Blasey Ford.
This recent unfounded claim about Zelensky is just another one to add to the list.

321.SaysTomHankswasarrestedinAustraliaforpedophilia,"
Ever since Tom Hanks tested positive for COVID-19 in Australia, where he was shooting a movie, misinformation about the actor has spread on social media. One conspiracy theory claims his COVID-19 diagnosis was actually a cover for something more nefarious. 
In a July 13 Facebook post, Hanks is pictured wearing a green bandana over his face. In two photos -- close ups of his ankles -- red circles are drawn around his right ankle. 
""Look who has a new ankle bracelet!"" the post says. ""Tom Hanks. Some of you don't know it but Mr. Hanks was arrested in Australia for pedophilia. He went on national TV to say he had COVID-19 and he was quarantine himself. Not true. He was in custody for a time then house arrest is n his hotel. Now, he's a flight risk.""
This post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
First of all, Hanks wasn't arrested in Australia for pedophilia. There's no evidence to support that and no news stories. If he had been charged with sex crimes against children, it would have been widely covered in the media. 
On March 11, the actor announced on Twitter that he and his wife, actor Rita Wilson, had tested positive for COVID-19. He said that they would follow the directions of medical officials. 
""We Hanks' will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires,"" he said. ""Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no?""

Several days later, they were released from the hospital in Queensland, Australia, but remained in self-isolation while they recovered from the coronavirus. 
By March 28, American news outlets were reporting that Hanks and Wilson were both back stateside and had been photographed driving around Los Angeles, where they live. 
The Daily Mail published the photos of Hanks that appear in the Facebook post in May 2020. Captions of the images say Hanks is in Los Angeles, not Australia.

The story didn't mention him wearing an ankle bracelet (something else that would definitely draw the attention of reporters and the paparazzi). The area around his ankle looks more like a gathering of fabric from his pants.
QAnon groups have pushed the unfounded claim that Hanks among other celebrities -- like Ellen DeGeneres and Oprah Winfrey -- have been arrested in connection with a child sex trafficking ring. USA Today searched for both DeGeners and Hanks on California's sex offender registry and the U.S. Department of Justice's national sex offender registry and found no records. Oprah responded publicly to the accusations.

99.DidRepBoebertGetHerG,"
In January 2021, many social media users started posting messages claiming that U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) had received a GED diploma (the equivalent of a high school diploma, earned by passing General Educational Development tests) months before she was elected to congress. 
The claims made in this meme are largely accurate. 
Boebert has supported the QAnon conspiracy theory. A spokesperson for Boebert also confirmed that the 34-year-old congresswoman earned her GED diploma in 2020. 
Boebert talked about her education with Colorado's Durango Herald in September 2020. The then-congressional candidate said that she was a ""good student"" when she attended Rifle High School but that she was a new mom at the time and prioritized raising her family over her education. 
Boebert said:
On her educational background, she said she never claimed to have graduated from Rifle High School. ""I went to my high school,"" she said.
""I was a brand-new mom, and I had to make hard decisions on successfully raising my child, or getting to high school biology class. And I chose to take care of my child,"" she said.
Boebert said she received her GED after completing a four-course review.
""I didn't go through the typical education course,"" she said. ""I was a great student. I had great grades. I loved being there, but I was starting my family and had different priorities."" 






It should also be noted that although many people have spread this factoid as a way of denigrating Boebert, the Colorado congresswoman is not the first person elected to office without a college education. According to a December 2020 report from the Congressional Research Service, ""17 Members of the House have no educational degree beyond a high school diploma.""
While the vast majority of politicians in 2020 have a college degree, that hasn't always been the case. According to The Washington Post, the percentage of politicians with college degrees has been steadily climbing for decades. In 1947, though, just over 50% of House members had a college degree.
Boebert responded to the online criticisms of her education in a January 2021 tweet, writing that ""you don't need an Ivy League degree to achieve the American Dream.""

It's worth mentioning that while Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has truly been criticized for being a bartender, as noted in the above-displayed tweet, she also graduated cum laude from Boston University in 2011. 
To sum up: It's true that Boebert, along with 16 other members of the House of Representatives, does not have a college education. Boebert received her GED diploma before she was elected to Congress in 2020.

116.DrAnthonyFauciandUShealthofficialsplottedforanewavianfluvirustoenforceuniversalfluvaccination,"
Social media users are sharing a claim that -- in a C-SPAN video of a public presentation -- Dr. Anthony Fauci and other federal Health and Human Services Department officials plotted for a new flu virus.
The conservative Gateway Pundit website made the claim with this headline:
""EXPLOSIVE VIDEO Emerges of Fauci and HHS Officials Plotting for 'A New Avian Flu Virus' to Enforce Universal Flu Vaccination.""
The article was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The claim is a gross misrepresentation of what the officials were talking about.
Similar claims were made by the conservative One America News network in reporting on the video, and by social media users who shared clips of the video on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
Gateway Pundit's article cited an Oct. 4 ""emergency broadcast"" by Alex Jones' InfoWars, a website known to air false news and conspiracy theories, which in turn cited the video.
The hourlong C-SPAN video, entitled ""Universal Flu Vaccine,"" is from an Oct. 29, 2019, panel discussion that included Fauci, a top HHS official who is also President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser; and Dr. Rick Bright, an immunologist and vaccine researcher who was then a top HHS official. 
Among the topics they discussed was the quest for a ""universal flu vaccine.""
The phrase ""enforcing universal flu vaccination"" in the Gateway Pundit headline gives the false impression that the goal of pursuing a universal flu vaccine is forced vaccination of all Americans.
But that's not what ""universal"" means in this case.

By Samantha Putterman * June 23, 2022







As the panelists explained, ongoing research toward a universal flu vaccine is aimed at creating a vaccine with long-lasting protection against multiple flu strains that would eliminate the need for annual flu shots.
As the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the federal agency Fauci heads, puts it:
""A key focus of NIAID's influenza research program is developing a universal flu vaccine, or a vaccine that provides robust, long-lasting protection against multiple subtypes of flu, rather than a select few. Such a vaccine would eliminate the need to update and administer the seasonal flu vaccine each year and could provide protection against newly emerging flu strains, potentially including those that could cause a flu pandemic.""
Fauci said during the session that viruses are ""a continual moving target, from season to season,"" unlike polio, smallpox and measles viruses. He described a prospective universal flu vaccine as ""a vaccine that induces a response in the body to that part of the influenza that doesn't change from season to season, from decade to decade or even that much when you get a pandemic.""
RELATED VIDEO
 
The panel discussion was not a plot for a new flu virus that could pave the way for forced vaccinations.
The headline also misrepresents the officials' references to avian flu, a disease that infects birds but can pose a risk to humans. Avian flu was mentioned once, in the context of possible future advances in how vaccines are developed and delivered. 
""It is not too crazy to think that an outbreak of a novel avian virus could occur in China somewhere, we could get the RNA sequence from that, beam it to a number of regional centers,"" Bright said, adding: ""The technology is there to be adapted and assembled to put into that futuristic view of a rapid response to an emerging novel threat.""
Our ruling
A headline widely shared on social media claimed that Fauci and U.S. health officials plotted ""for a new avian flu virus to enforce universal flu vaccination.""
The claim broadly misrepresents what they were talking about. The video shows they didn't discuss any such plot. 
Fauci's reference to a universal vaccine meant one that could provide long-lasting protection from multiple flu strains and eliminate the need for annual flu shots.
The claim is false and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire!

32.AssadSupportersPlant,"
A group of British and American supporters of Syrian dictator and suspected war criminal Bashar al-Assad wants to put the media ""on trial"" in a May 2018 panel, where they had planned to determine whether journalists for Britain's Channel 4 and the BBC -- who reported from conflict zones in Syria and Libya -- should be considered terrorists.
The panel was scheduled for 27 May 2018 at Leeds City Museum, but the museum has since cancelled the event. It included Vanessa Beeley, a British blogger who has gained notoriety by churning out regime propaganda, and Patrick Henningsen, a former writer for Alex Jones's conspiracy trolling network InfoWars.com.
Both are now editors for 21stCenturyWire.com, a disreputable web site that posts pro-Assad disinformation among a garbled cornucopia of pseudoscience and Holocaust denial. The site often hosts David Icke, a British personality who sells the belief that the world is secretly controlled by a race of shape-shifting lizard people who have faked mass casualty events like 9/11.
The panel was also to include Peter Ford, former UK ambassador to Syria, university professors Tim Hayward (professor of Environmental Political Theory at the University of Edinburgh) and Piers Robinson (chair of Politics, Society and Political Journalism at Sheffield University), along with Robert Stuart, who believes that horrific BBC footage documenting the aftermath of a 2016 attack on a school in northern Syria was staged.
According to the event's web site, the panel was set to focus on whether journalists from Britain's Channel 4 and the BBC, who reported from Syria and Libya in 2016 and 2011, respectively, violated the UK's Terrorism Act:
The panel of experts will this time focus on the media's propensity to either embed its journalists directly with terrorist forces, most notably Channel 4's Krishnan Guru-Murthy embedded with Nour Al Zinki in Syria, or disseminate material directly from terrorist sources. In Syria, the White Helmets have been overwhelmingly the source from which establishment and corporate media have taken their information. Previous reporting from Libya in 2011 followed a similar pattern when the BBC's Ian Pannell was embedded with Islamic extremist, anti-government forces, while the overwhelming media narrative complied with information from those same sources.
The question therefore arises, by aligning itself to terrorist organisations, by gaining entry into sovereign nations by way of these forces and by reporting their line while misleading the general public that they are merely 'Activists' or 'Opposition forces', has the mainstream print and broadcast media acted in contravention of the UK Terrorism Act? 






The Committee to Protect Journalists' advocacy director Courtney Radsch told us that the event bore alarming similarities to what authoritarian governments do in order to repress independent journalism -- namely, equating reporting about terrorism with terrorism itself:
That is extremely problematic. In the past two years we have seen record numbers of reporters jailed. There are journalists around the world who are facing years in prison using this same justification. 
She pointed to Egyptian photojournalist Mahmoud Abu Zeid (also known as Shawkan) who is currently jailed, and faces charges of belonging to the banned Muslim Brotherhood group in Egypt. During his incarceration, he was awarded the 2018 UNESCO press freedom award, drawing inevitable criticism from Egyptian authorities.
Additionally, Radsch said, Syria is currently the deadliest place in the world for journalists to work. Since the start of the years-long war, 119 journalists have died covering it. Creating lists of journalists a group aligned with the government doesn't like, she said, is ""not going to go over well.""
Although characters like Henningsen and Beeley have been propelled into the limelight by casting themselves as heroes in a supposed anti-imperialist movement against Western-initiated regime change in Syria, their ideas would otherwise be considered fringe. Henningsen has written that mass shootings in the United States -- such as the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre -- are hoaxes, as was the moon landing and 9/11. Beeley, meanwhile, has written that she believes the struggle for human rights in Gaza and the civil war in Syria are proxy battles against an overarching Zionist conspiracy to dominate the world. 
Since the Russians became militarily involved in Syria in 2015, however, Western activists like Beeley and Henningsen have been looped in as key conveyors of propaganda, which is often meant to obfuscate facts and promote confusion in an effort to maintain global paralysis as the brutal war has dragged on since 2011. The result has been, in the words of former Middle East editor for the Guardian Brian Whitaker, a ""battle in which honest reporting and the search for truth have come under sustained attack.""
Scott Lucas, a journalist and professor of political science and international studies at the University of Birmingham, told us the Russian government has leveraged activists like Henningsen and Beeley as attackers in that battle:
You find a theme for your campaign and you just put it out there. You know your propaganda sympathizers will pick it up. You don't have to pay them to do it, but at times you will flatter them - in this case the flattery that comes with being asked to speak at a conference or write an opinion piece or go on [Kremlin-funded network] RT and talk for a couple minutes.
A lot of [the motivation] is ego.They're getting flattery from the Russians. Vanessa gets to go over to Moscow and meet [Russian government spokeswoman Maria] Zakharova. She gets to go to Syria and get the flattery of the officials there. They play to that sense of ego and play to her desire that she be seen as a 'journalist', which is very important to Henningsen as well.
We sent an email to Beeley and Henningsen seeking comment for this story. Instead of responding to our questions, Henningsen posted a screenshot of our message to his social media account.
A spokesperson for Leeds City Museum sent us the following statement from the City Council on the cancellation:
Leeds City Museum recently received a request to host a panel discussion on May 27. Since accepting the booking, we have been made aware of further details regarding some of the content and discussion topics which would be part of the event.
Whilst the council and museums service are always in favour of promoting free speech and debate, our booking policy clearly states that events are subject to cancellation.
In line with that policy, we have decided that the museum is not an appropriate venue for this event and have informed the organisers that their booking has been cancelled.

204.IbelievewithouthavingdefinitiveproofthatthemilitaryisinchargeofourcountrybecauseJoeBidenisanillegalpresident,"
Nearly a week after President Joe Biden was inaugurated, supporters of Donald Trump are still spreading conspiracy theories that he isn't actually running the country.
In a Jan. 25 interview with the conservative Patriotically Correct Radio Show, Lin Wood, a defamation lawyer, said Biden's presidency is a sham.
""I believe, without having definitive proof, that the military is in charge of our country, and I believe they are in charge of our country because Joe Biden is an illegal president,"" he said. ""And I believe the military has evidence that establishes that fact.""
Later in the video, Wood floats the theory that Biden has been signing blank pages or executive orders ""prepared for him by the people that control him."" The clip was published on Facebook and flagged as part of the company's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

(Screenshot from Facebook)
Wood was banned from Twitter in early January after he promoted the Capitol insurrection and false claims about the results of the 2020 presidential election. He has also promoted the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory; Wood's claims about ""little children being abused, molested, and sacrificed"" by ""leaders in our government"" were aired on the Patriotically Correct Radio Show before his appearance.
We've previously fact-checked false statements from Wood about the 2020 election, as well as rumors about a military takeover of the federal government. So we wanted to take a look at this post, too.
Biden is not an ""illegal president,"" and there is no evidence that the military is running the country.
Biden's election was legal, and followed the process spelled out in Article II of the Constitution. All 50 states and the District of Columbia have certified their election results, which Congress finalized on Jan. 7. Biden won 306 electoral votes, while Trump won 232. Since Biden got more than 270 electoral votes, he is the rightful president.

Election officials in every state have said there was no sign of significant fraud during the voting process. 


The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency called the election ""the most secure in American history.""


The Justice Department said it uncovered no evidence of widespread fraud.


Not one of the lawsuits from Trump and his allies offered evidence that voter fraud affected the election outcome.


Before Inauguration Day, QAnon supporters said the military would take over the federal government instead of Biden becoming president. That did not come to pass, and the U.S. is not under a military dictatorship.
We reached out to Wood for a comment, but we haven't heard back.
His statement is inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire!

The ingredients of COVID-19 vaccines are safe, publicly available, and scrutinized by regulators. Yet, in some corners of social media, they are claimed to be ""secret,"" ""illegal,"" and ""toxic.""
Now, they are said to be ever-changing.
""Growing mountains of evidence show that PHARMA (Pfizer, Moderna, J&J) are shipping lots of jabs with varying ingredients, potency & EVEN placebo lots,"" says a post shared recently on Facebook. 
The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
It links to a video featuring German conspiracy theorist Reiner Fuellmich, who has repeatedly spread misinformation during the pandemic.
He has previously claimed that COVID-19 is less dangerous than the common flu, that the pandemic was schemed by global elites to control people, that PCR tests are fabricated evidence to justify coercive measures, and that residents of a nursing home in Germany died because of the vaccine, not the virus.
His claims about ingredients, potency, and placebos are as baseless as his previous allegations, according to the Food and Drug Administration, the federal agency that regulates vaccines in the United States.
""These claims are false,"" the FDA told PolitiFact. ""We are confident in the safety, effectiveness and manufacturing data behind each COVID-19 vaccine emergency use authorization.""

According to International Olympic Committee data, ""an average of 29 athletes under the age of 35 suffered sudden death per year from 1966 to 2004. From March 2021 to March 2022, 769 athletes have died or suffered cardiac arrest.""












By Samantha Putterman * June 23, 2022







The FDA demands that vaccines go through quality-control tests that evaluate ""critical vaccine qualities"" like purity and potency to determine their safety and effectiveness. It also checks any changes made to the formula or dosage of vaccines.
Pfizer did modify the composition of its vaccine recently, adding an ingredient that allows the product to be stored for longer. But the core ingredients of the shot have remained the same, and the new one is not dangerous and is commonly used in vaccines, according to a fact-check of a similar claim by USA Today.
The change was checked and approved by the FDA, which said in a press release that the new formula ""does not present safety or effectiveness concerns.""
A spokesperson for Pfizer told PolitiFact that it does not ship vaccines with varying ingredients or potency and that ""the approved vaccine is the only one shipped."" The company also said that placebo injections are only sent to health facilities that are doing trials. ""Otherwise, no placebos are shipped to recipients.""
Moderna did not answer a request for comment, and Johnson & Johnson did not answer specific questions about ingredients, potency, and placebos, but there is no credible evidence to support the idea that they are shipping varying batches of vaccines.
Health professionals have previously given saline injections instead of the proper COVID-19 vaccine to patients in Canada, Scotland, Germany, and Australia, but those accidents were the result of mix-ups by health professionals.
Our ruling
A Facebook post claims that vaccine manufacturers are shipping COVID-19 shots with different formulas and strengths, and that some lots are coming with placebos. 
 
The FDA said that the claims are wrong, and Pfizer said that it does not change the composition or strength of its vaccines between lots, and that it does not ship placebo injections widely. The claim was originally made by a conspiracy theorist who has repeatedly spread falsehoods during the pandemic. 
We rate the post False.

98.ForgedDocumentsAlleg,"
In mid-December 2017, far-right Internet personalities Chuck C. Johnson and Mike Cernovich boasted about being in possession of documents detailing sexual harassment that they claimed would end the career of a United States senator. But it turned out the documents were forged.
The incident illustrates a recent trend in which political operatives opposed to a free press try and discredit reporters by attempting to plant fake stories. The practice gained steam in the lead-up to the special election in Alabama after a heavily-sourced Washington Post story detailed allegations of sexual molestation against the losing candidate, Republican Roy Moore.
Both Cernovich and Johnson have claimed that a ""hoaxer"" gave them the falsified documents. Cernovich pointed to a video he posted on Periscope in which he said early on he doubted the veracity of the documents. In a phone interview he told us claims he backpedaled after the police were called were inaccurate:
If people want to have a good laugh at me because I thought I had a good story and I didn't, that's fine. This is a learning experience for me -- not to hype something until it's fully developed.. I felt a great deal of embarrassment because I thought it was real.
What's sort of annoying to me is, I don't mind people making fun of me on the Internet. But the whodunit it is way more interesting. This person put a lot of thought into the hoax.
Cernovich sent us a copy of the complaint. It is a password-protected PDF that looks like a court document -- except it's missing names of attorneys. It also references House Rule 23 (Schumer of course is a senator to whom House Rule 23 wouldn't apply). Axios, which first reported Schumer had gone to the police noted another red flag -- on some of the dates of alleged incidents, Schumer was traveling outside Washington, D.C. 






However Cernovich pointed to text messages that show hoaxer falsely claiming to know the fake harassment victim's husband and using a false identity to make the story seem credible. The document also contained details that could be corroborated -- for instance it mentions one incident occurred on the day Schumer sent a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency. Cernovich said:
It goes to show the length people will go to now to hoax the media.
The document was apparently shopped around to various news outlets but no one would bite -- except Johnson. On 12 December 2017, Johnson took to his Facebook page and bragged:
Currently reading the sexual harassment settlement documents of a major Democratic US Senator...
Later he wrote:
Michael Cernovich & I are going to end the career of a U.S. Senator.
Cernovich wrote similarly salacious teases, reporting he was on the phone with Johnson who had the ""full case file."" Later, he wrote:
I am in possession of a sexual harassment complaint filed against on of [Senator Gillibrand's] colleagues. Will she read the complaint? Ask John Conyers if I'm bluffing. 






Both have been criticized for these posts. Cernovich said he deleted his because they were inaccurate.
Matt House, spokesman for Sen. Schumer, sent us the following statement:
The document is a forged document and every allegation is false. We have turned it over to the Capitol Police and asked them to investigate and pursue criminal charges because it is clear the law has been broken. We believe the individual responsible for forging the document should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law to prevent other malicious actors from doing the same. 
Eva Malecki, spokeswoman for Capitol Police, told us the agency doesn't comment on ongoing investigations.
After it became apparent that the document was false, Johnson posted a statement about the incident to his Facebook page:
I was sent a very sophisticated complaint that claimed Senator Chuck Schumer had sexually harassed a subordinate and paid her off. After communicating with the source through encrypted email and texts the source went dark. I sent the document to multiple journalists, lawyers, and members of Congress, all of whom agreed it should be investigated. I am offering $10k for the identity of the persons responsible and would be happy to cooperate with any investigators.
We contacted Johnson by phone. He only said, ""I don't like you guys, bye,"" before hanging up.
Both Johnson and Cernovich have colorful histories as Internet characters. Cernovich has ricocheted from hawking a self-help regimen he calls ""Gorilla Mindset"" and spreading bizarre and debunked conspiracy theories like PizzaGate only to help Buzzfeed News land a scoop by providing them with settlement documents in which a staffer accused long-time Democratic Michigan Rep. John Conyers of sexual harassment, a story which led to Conyers' resignation.
Johnson has found himself in the limelight more than once for spreading false information. In 2014 he made his first public splash by attempting to publicly name an anonymous woman who wrote a controversial essay about being sexually assaulted on a college campus -- but he named the wrong person. His web site GotNews.com retracted a story in August 2017, again for naming the wrong person, this time as the driver of a car that drove into a crowd of counter-protesters during a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville and killed 32-year-old Heather Heyer. The story resulted in death threats targeting the innocent man and pending defamation litigation against Johnson.
Later in 2017, his site falsely accused a Mandalay Bay security guard of being an accomplice during the 1 October 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, spawning multiple conspiracy theories.
Johnson also runs the web site WeSearchr where he raises money to crowdfund causes like supporting legal defense for the neo-Nazi web site Daily Stormer or seeking out information to show French president Emmanuel Macron is gay. The address given on that site for both ""WeSearchr Holdings"" and GotNews belongs to a uniform store in El Monte, California that sells scrubs for health care workers.

52.DidMarjorieTaylorGre,"
On March 3, 2021, conservative media outlet The Washington Times reported that U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said new metal detectors designed to keep lawmakers safe following the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection were a form of voter suppression. 

First, some context: Capitol maintenance crews installed the machines to screen people entering House chambers after the deadly insurrection. Since then, most House members used the metal detectors regularly without questions, The Associated Press reported. But some Republicans initially sidestepped the devices or refused to be checked with wands after they set them off. 
""Capitol Police have now placed desks and velvet ropes near the metal detectors to block anyone from walking around the machines,"" the AP reported on Jan. 22.
Now, let us address the claim that Greene, a far-right conspiratorialist, compared the safety measure to nefarious schemes by partisan groups to prevent people from voting in U.S. elections. 






According to CSPAN's video recording of congressional proceedings on March 2, the representative indeed said the practice of standing in ""long lines to enter the chamber"" to use the metal detectors was ""real voter suppression"" in her opinion. She made the statement during a debate over legislation to change campaign-finance and voting laws on (read bill H.R. 1 here).
Here's Greene's full quote, according to the video footage:
I rise in opposition to H.R. 1. While we are talking about voter suppression and long lines, there is real voter suppression that happens right here in Congress. Many members of Congress have to stand in long lines to enter the chamber going through metal detectors, emptying our pockets, and being treated very disrespectfully. So that is real suppression, and it's a shame it happens right here on the House floor.
Standing in line to vote is not voter suppression -- it's just part of the voting process, just like people stand in line to buy groceries at the grocery store. 
Voters in a northwestern region of Georgia in November 2020 elected Greene to represent them, and she began her term in Washington, D.C., in January 2021.
During her campaign and afterwards, she embraced the QAnon conspiracy theory and advocated on the frontlines of former President Donald Trump's misinformation campaign to try to convince voters that Joe Biden won the presidency using illegal methods.

35.ExplainingConspiracy,"



4761FactCheck.org staff writer Saranac Hale Spencer appeared on The Colin McEnroe Show on WNPR, a Connecticut public radio station, to talk about the conspiracy theories and misinformation that spread online after the deadly shooting on Feb. 14 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida.
A week after the massacre, the top trending video on YouTube espoused the idea that the students who had survived were actually just ""crisis actors"" employed to further a liberal, anti-gun agenda during media interviews about the tragedy. More than two dozen stories advancing the same message swarmed Facebook. None of it was true.
That conspiracy theory was focused in particular on 17-year-old student David Hogg. One hoax claimed Hogg was actually a 28-year-old man who was arrested in South Carolina, and another claimed he had graduated in 2015 from Redondo Shores Continuation High School, which is for at-risk students, in California. In fact, Hogg is an active student at Stoneman Douglas High School, where he is in the astronomy club, on its television news show, and president of the drone club.

On June 23, 2021, software pioneer John McAfee was found dead in his prison cell, hours after a Spanish court approved his extradition to the United States to face various charges of tax evasion. After news broke, a number of conspiracy theories started to circulate online. Some claimed, for instance, that McAfee's ""$WHACKD"" tattoo indicated that the software pioneer did not take his own life. (You can read more about the tattoo here.) Some social media users also attempted to use McAfee's death to turn a tragic incident -- the collapse of a condo near Miami Beach, Florida, that has left at least four people dead and more than a hundred more missing -- into a conspiracy theory.
On Twitter, an image supposedly showing a message McAfee posted on June 8, 2021, was circulated with claims that Champlain Towers had been intentionally demolished to destroy files McAfee had hidden there. This claim was also attached to another message that claimed McAfee's alleged son, Pat McAfee, had an office at this building. 

There is no evidence to support these claims.
The above-displayed tweet does not appear on McAfee's timeline and appears to have been doctored. And while McAfee previously claimed that he had fathered 47 children, there are very few details to back up this assertion. Regardless, there doesn't appear to be any record of John McAfee having a son named ""Pat McAfee."" The person of this name who may be most familiar to American audiences, sports analyst Pat McAfee, is not McAfee's son and has already confirmed on Twitter that he does not have a condo in Florida. 






We were unable to find any record of the above-displayed alleged tweet, which reads ""If anything ever happens to me, please know that 31TB of files I have are located on hard drives in my condo near 88th Street and Collins Avenue Just north of Miami Beach,"" on McAfee's Twitter timeline. We were also unable to find any retweets or quote tweets of this message directing back to a deleted link.
It's also highly unlikely that this message was posted and subsequently deleted from McAfee's account. Not only is there no trace of the original URL, but after McAfee's death, social media users archived hundreds of tweets that had been posted by McAfee, presumably because they thought the account could be deleted. We looked over those tweets on Archive.is and found no record of a message from McAfee saying that he hid files in the building that collapsed in Florida. 
It should also be noted that there's no reason at present to suggest that the building in Surfside, Florida was intentionally ""demolished."" While an exact cause has not yet been determined, officials noted that there was no evidence of foul play.
The Miami Herald reported on one possible cause for the building's collapse:
Greg Batista, a professional engineer from Davie who specializes in concrete repair projects, said that after watching the Surfside condo tower collapsing to rubble in online videos, one potential structural flaw jumped out at him.
""Concrete spalling."" Here's what it means.
Batista said that when salt water seeps into porous concrete, it causes the reinforced steel rods known as rebar in the support beams to rust and expand. In turn, the expansion breaks up the concrete and that weakens the beams.
As of this writing, the only connection between McAfee's death and the building collapse in Florida is that they both took place in June 2021. McAfee did not tweet that he was storing files in the building, and the claim that his alleged son ""Pat McAffee"" owned a condo in the building appears to have been conjured out of thin air.

91.NoTrumpDidntTweetTha,"
In late December 2020, various social media users and websites shared a fake tweet mocked up to look like it was posted by U.S. President Donald Trump, in which he supposedly announced he had ""declared Martial Law"": 

Trump didn't write this tweet. It doesn't appear on his Twitter timeline on Dec. 18, 2020, nor can it be found in a searchable database that archives all of his tweets, or a database listing his deleted tweets.
The fake tweet appears to play on calls by some Trump supporters for Trump to invoke martial law and order the military intervene in the 2020 presidential election over a conspiracy theory that the vote count was skewed by massive fraud. Proponents of the theory claim that Trump, not President-elect Joe Biden, won the election.
News reports circulated in mid-December 2020 saying that Trump had toyed with the idea of invoking martial law in a heated meeting inside the White House, which drew a backlash, including from U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who called it ""embarrassing.""
Trump responded on Dec. 19, 2020, by claiming on Twitter that reports he had considered invoking martial law were false: 

Trump lost to President-elect Joe Biden by more than 7 million votes and 74 Electoral College points. His own administration's Department of Homeland Security debunked Trump's ""election fraud"" disinformation campaign with a statement holding the November 2020 election was the ""most secure in American history.""

044.AltRightTurnsAgainst,"
It only took a matter of days for ""pro-white"" protest organizer Jason Kessler, whose ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia ended in a disastrous episode of violence on 12 August 2017, to go from being a darling of the alt-right movement to a target of one of their paranoid conspiracy theories.
In keeping with the preferred alt-right explanation of why the Charlottesville event went south, namely the machinations of a vast left-wing conspiracy to foment racial violence and spark a civil war, alternative media outlets began accusing Kessler of being a ""deep state"" operative in the pay of billionaire leftist George Soros.  
Among those was the pro-Trump news and opinion web site DC Whispers, who reported:
Well this is fishy. His name is Jason Kessler. He is the one cited as the organizer of the now infamous ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The thing is, Mr. Kessler's arrival on the ""alt right"" and/or ""White Nationalist"" scene didn't occur until November 2016.
That's right - Kessler didn't start his white nationalist activism until after Donald Trump won the White House. Prior to that it appears he participated in the far left/socialist Occupy Wall Street movement as noted by the far-left, George Soros-funded Southern Poverty Law Center.
...
It is well known how much the DEEP STATE despises POTUS Trump. Is it beyond the realm of possibility to consider Jason Kessler and others like him are actually DEEP STATE operatives working to further divide and conqueror America? Trump is a direct threat to that plan. Why not paint Trump with the broad strokes of racism, hatred and bigotry in order to further erode his millions strong base of support?
...
Is Jason Kessler a misguided activist or a willing pawn in a much larger psy-ops program that is at this very moment rippling across the country? Who knows. There is certainly enough already there, though, to make one say ""hmmm....""
A blogger for Rightwing News wrote:
Jason Kessler is the organizer of Unite the Right, the group of white nationalists that duked it out with Black Lives Matter and Antifa in Charlottesville, Virginia where one woman and two police officers were killed. The source of the information is even more surprising, but as far as I can tell, it's legitimate. The Southern Poverty Law Center is reporting that Kessler was a part of Occupy Wall Street and voted for Barack Obama and supported him for eight years. Gee... and now he's a white supremacist. Strange days.
Who is this guy? Is this a mistake or is he indeed a liberal gone racist? Is he a plant and this whole thing a set up to pit Americans against each other? Lots of questions and very, very few answers. Kessler has also written for major publicans such as The Daily Mail, who now has cut him loose and has distanced themselves from him. I don't blame them in the least. Everything about this guy is off and suspect now. He just got thrown out of an interview... I guess he was chased out and mobbed over his racist leanings. But he is scheduled to do another rally in Dallas shortly and has vowed to step up his racist cause. Kessler is doing major damage out there and he is not what he seems. I suspect he's a Marxist as well. 






Far-right celebs were also sharing dark suspicions about Kessler's ideological purity:

-- infowars (@infowars) August 15, 2017

We, too, have spoken to Kessler, and we've looked into a number of the claims these and other sources have leveled against him to make the case that he's a left-wing operative. This is what we learned: 






Was Jason Kessler a Barack Obama supporter?
True. He told us (and has consistently said elsewhere) that he was an Obama supporter and voted for him. He says he began to sour on Obama and the Democrats during Obama's second administration because of their focus on what Kessler terms ""identity politics.""
Was Kessler involved in the Occupy movement?
Mostly false. According to Kessler, Occupy's ""anti-globalist"" stance caught his interest in 2011 and he attended an Occupy Charlottesville demonstration, but found he didn't see eye-to-eye with the group in a confrontation he described as none too friendly. (The source typically cited to support the claim that he was ""involved"" in the Occupy movement, a Southern Poverty Law Center dossier on Kessler's political history, uses the phrase ""apparent involvement"" and supplies no evidence to indicate he had anything other than a relatively brief encounter with the Charlottesville contingent.)
Did Kessler write articles for CNN that were sympathetic to the Occupy movement?
False. Kessler says he never worked for CNN, and we spoke to a source at CNN who confirmed it. A writer named Jason Kessler was once employed by CNN, and he did cover Occupy Wall Street protests among many other topics, but according to CNN it was not the same Jason Kessler who went on to lead Unite the Right.
On 26 August 2017, the conservative blog SpartaReport linked to a 2013 tweet identifying a Jason M. Kessler as a former CNN reporter (the Charlottesville organizer's full name is Jason Erik Kessler).
Did Kessler accept a $1,320 campaign consulting fee from a Democratic Congressional candidate in 2012? 






False. Kessler told us he has never received money from any political campaign. Moreover, the ""proof"" offered up by Kessler's accusers, a screenshot of a Federal Elections Commission entry showing that a ""Jason Kessler"" received that amount from the 2012 Congressional campaign of North Carolina Democrat Charles Murphy, is easily debunked. Looking deeper, we discovered that the Jason Kessler listed there was: a) a North Carolina resident (Unite the Right's Jason Kessler was, and remains, a resident of Charlottesville, Virginia); b) Charles Murphy's campaign manager.
Did Kessler change his political views only after Donald Trump succeeded in being elected president?
False. As we mentioned above, Kessler says his political views began to evolve during Obama's second term in office as he became more and more disaffected by the left's dogmatic emphasis on racial identity politics. Looking at his blog posts from late 2015, we find him reluctant to reveal much about those views:
Despite having a definite viewpoint, I have sympathies with both the left & right of political/social thought. I want both in my readership. Therefore the political thought of my private life will be kept private until such time as it is relevant to my work or a critique of my work, as I've stated.
By February 2016, however, we find Kessler openly condemning the Democratic Party as the ""'Unite to Get Whitey' party"" and complaining about the ""anti-white media and anti-white laws"":
I'm actually really okay with Beyonce's racial advocacy at the Superbowl. I'm a big proponent of free speech across the board. I think it's really important for white people not to whine about it like little bitches. Then they're just playing into the same victim game. They are affirming and condoning it as  a reasonable discourse in 21st century America. I do however feel like white people, just like any group based on race, religion or creed, should be able to advocate their interests without facing discrimination for it from the culture at large.
Every group is allowed to lobby based on their identity except white people (and men but that's another story). The Democrats are essentially the ""Unite to Get Whitey"" party. There will come a time when white people understand that they also need to stick together as a political force. Otherwise we'll keep being bombarded by anti-white media & anti-white laws. 
We're going to be a minority soon & we're already treated like one. Don't think we aren't going to be oppressed more & more if we can't stand up for ourselves.
More chillingly, Kessler speaks of the importance of tribes and civilizations ""clashing"" for the good of natural selection:
Cultures, tribes & civilizations are meant to clash just as we always have in the past, just like it is with nearly every other beast in the animal kingdom. We are beasts. We share 99% of our DNA with bonobos and almost as much with the other Great Apes. Competition is part of natural selection and evolution. Sorry Marxists, your vision of utopia will never exist because it is counter to human nature. The more your ""oppressed"" groups gain power the more they will use it to enact revenge. 
 Conflict is how we adapt. This is how stronger cultures survive while degenerate cultures (drug use, sexual irresponsibility, failure to comply with societal expectations like laws, etc.) must learn to either adapt or assimilate.
This social engineering project the West has engaged in is a failure. The more righteous cultures are dragged down by the dead weight of failed ones. More than that, failed cultures are given competitive advantages just so they can keep tearing down the responsible, hardworking individuals. 






In October 2016, Kessler went on a rant criticizing the major social media platforms for, in his view, ""censoring"" conservative viewpoints:
The owner of Twitter is a vocal Black Lives Matter supporter and regular bans and censors prominent conservatives like Milo Yiannopoulos and Chuck Johnson (the reporter who outed UVA rape hoaxer Jackie Coakley). Can you imagine if Bell Telephone Company or AT&T lines had been monitored by billionaire plutocrats for ""incorrect speech"" as the views of social media users today are?
He was also moved to express support for a strong critic of Black Lives Matter, University of Virginia lecturer Doug Muir, who had called BLM ""racist."" In the process, Kessler himself described BLM as ""a group which has advocated for the killing of white police officers on many occasions"":
Since the 1960's when the roots of far-left liberal activism reached maturation we've seen many successful attempts to create ""choking points"" around free speech. These tactics were outlined by dedicated Communist Saul Alinsky in his book ""Rules for Radicals"". Just like you can assault an army in more directions than just head on (from the side through an underpass, etc.) there are several ways to deny people their rights in ways unknown to the founding fathers. One of which we see on campuses throughout the nation where any professor who makes remarks critical of multiculturalism or political correctness is, cajoled, fired, or intimidated into silence. We saw this recently in the public tarring and feathering of UVA lecturer Doug Muir, who dared to claim that Black Lives Matter is a racist group on Facebook. For the record, Black Lives Matter is a group which has advocated for the killing of white police officers on many occasions. We can see the fruits of their labors in the five police officers slain by a BLM member in Dallas, Texas. Their critics point out that they exploit the crime epidemic in inner city ghettos in order to advocate policy preferences and benefits for their racial in-group.
In November 2016, Kessler campaigned for the removal from office of Charlottesville Vice Mayor Wes Bellamy, who had called for the removal of Charlottesville's Robert E. Lee statue (the same statue, in fact, around whose fate Kessler would organize his Unite the Right rally in 2017).
And in December 2016, a seemingly jubilant Kessler celebrated the election of President Donald Trump and ""the end of identity politics"":
2016 was an unprecedented year in the history of our democracy. After decades of stigmatization and encroaching government oppression the white, blue collar heartland of America stood up against the forces of globalization, free trade, and open-borders. They voted down the displacement of American citizens by illegal labor and overzealous immigration from the most extreme Islamic countries on Earth. They banished Hillary Clinton to the legacy of a two-time loser in the footnotes of history and they sent Donald J. Trump to the White House.
None of this reads to us like the history of a man who underwent a sudden, ""feigned"" conversion to an alt-right, ""pro-white"" political stance in the wake of the election of Trump (for whom Kessler voted, he told us, and whose presidency he still supports). The evidence shows, rather, that Kessler was already evincing well-developed ""white identity"" views by February 2016, and has consistently reviled the left and expressed solidarity with the alt-right ever since.
It would appear that his former alt-right compatriots sensed a convenient scapegoat in Kessler -- someone they could easily finger as a patsy of George Soros and the Clinton-Obama ""deep state"" in their rush to blame the Charlottesville debacle on a left-wing conspiracy. Given that he organized the event and set its agenda, Kessler indeed bears some responsibility for what happened there, but he does so not as some imagined ""Soros/deep state plant,"" but rather as a legitimate figurehead of the alt-right white nationalist movement.

At least six in the group had plotted to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, investigators said -- surprising news that generated wide national coverage at a time when fears of civil unrest are already in the spotlight.
But some social media claims suggest that journalists lost interest in this headline-grabbing case after they discovered the suspects were sympathetic to Black Lives Matter and antifa. Antifa, which stands for ""anti-fascist,"" is a broad, loosely affiliated coalition of left-wing activists that's been around for decades.
""Notice how the Whitmer kidnapping story disappeared after we found out the perps were ANTIFA and BLM anarchists,"" one post says. 
""13 Antifa members arrested for plotting to kidnap a governor,"" another post says. ""13 Antifa members ARRESTED for trying to KIDNAP Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to START A CIVIL WAR.""
Both posts were flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
First, the case is still very much in the news. But it's also continuing to unfold, so there's a lot we don't know. However, there is no evidence that the kidnapping suspects are antifa activists. And we found that of what is now a total of 14 suspects, only one is known to have attended a Black Lives Matter protest. Another suspect criticized the movement.
The suspects and their ties
On Oct. 9, the day after the kidnapping plot was disclosed to the public, the New York Times published a story titled, ""What we know about the alleged plot to kidnap Michigan's governor.""
The article doesn't mention Black Lives Matter or antifa, except for a reference to a tweet from President Donald Trump, who, criticizing Whitmer, said Democrats ""refuse to condemn Antifa, Anarchists, Looters and Mobs that burn down Democrat run cities.""
The FBI named Adam Fox was the leader of the kidnapping plot. Fox reached out to members of an anti-government group known as the Wolverine Watchmen for help, according to the Times. 
Seven members of the Wolverine Watchmen were arrested and state authorities accused them of threatening to start a civil war and collecting the addresses of police officers to target them.
In addition to Fox, the names of the other men facing federal charges are Kaleb Franks, Brandon Caserta, Ty Garbin, Daniel Harris and Barry Croft.  
The federal criminal complaint against these men frequently references a Michigan based ""militia group."" It does not mention antifa or Black Lives Matter. 
The names of the men charged by the state are Paul Bellar, Shawn Fix, Eric Molitor, Michael Null, William Null, Pete Musico and Joseph Morrison. The state later arrested an eighth man: Brian Higgins.
The state affidavit in support of the criminal complaint against these men does not mention antifa or Black Lives Matter either. Rather, it describes the Wolverine Watchmen as an ""anti-government, anti-law enforcement, militia group."" The affidavit reads:

stated on July 5, 2022 in a tweet








Says an image shows the Highland Park shooting suspect ""in jail or rehab or a psychiatric center"" before the shooting.












By Bill McCarthy * July 5, 2022







""Members of Wolverine Watchmen periodically met for ""field training exercises"" (FTXs) on private property in remote areas where they engaged in firearms training and tactical drills to prepare for the 'boogaloo,' a (term) referencing a violent uprising against the government or impending politically-motivated civil war."" 
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel told NPR that multiple white supremacist and anti-government groups acted ""in concert based on shared extreme ideology."" 
Some of the suspects appeared at protests supporting different causes before their arrest, but of the 14 we only found evidence of one person attending a Black Lives Matter event. The individuals were aligning themselves with other causes.
The Null brothers both attended a protest against Whitmer's executive orders to slow the spread of the coronavirus, according to the Times. They were photographed there carrying long guns.
A sheriff in Barry County, Mich., has also said that he met William Null several years ago when he came to his office to vent about the Black Lives Matter movement, according to the Washington Post. The sheriff said Null wanted to start his own cause -- ""My Life Matters"" -- which he eventually turned into what he called the Michigan Liberty Militia, according to the Post.
Later, Null told the sheriff that he drove to Flint during the city's water contamination crisis to pass out water bottles alongside Black Lives Matter activists, the Post said.
At least one of the suspects, Daniel Harris, did attend a Black Lives Matter protest, said Amy Cooter, a Vanderbilt University lecturer who studies militias in the United States. Harris who was quoted in the Oakland County Times saying he was upset about the killing of George Floyd and police violence. 
A video clip shows another suspect, Brandon Caserta, standing in front of an anarchist flag saying Trump is a ""tyrant."" 
Boogaloo movement more likely, experts say
Cooter, who recently dug into this issue on Twitter, told us she's seen ""zero evidence that (the suspects) are antifa.""
She speculated that some people are conflating anarchy and antifa to try to divert attention away from the suspects' militia connections. 
But anarchy is more closely related to the Boogaloo movement -- an extremist effort aimed at overthrowing the government -- than antifa, she said. Antifa activists tend to include communists, socialists and anarchists who protest against white supremacy and other far-right causes. Experts say that while they sometimes turn violent, the bulk of antifa organizing is nonviolent.
Many militia members are opposed to racism, Cooter said, and they expressed genuine outrage over the death of George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis in May after a police officer pressed his knee against Floyd's neck. But she said their support for Black Lives Matter protests are rooted in ""notions of anti-governmentalism, a more right-wing concept.""
JJ MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, has also tweeted about the case. She criticized ""Right-wing Facebook"" for ""trying to reframe the Michigan militia kidnaping plot as a left-wing extremist conspiracy."" More recently, she described the defendants as ""a mix of Boogaloos and militants.""
Our ruling
The Facebook post claims that the suspects in the kidnapping plot are ""ANTIFA and BLM anarchists.""
We haven't found anything to support the claim that the suspects are antifa activists. We looked for news coverage, court documents or expert opinion that could corroborate that and came up empty. 
At least one of the suspects attended a Black Lives Matter protest. But to paint the group as a whole as antifa and BLM activists is disingenuous, and discounts the vast reporting from the media and state and federal officials on the militia and anti-government ties of the men arrested. 
We rate this post Mostly False.

52.HeresaFactWeWenttoth,"
NEW YORK (AP) -- Fifty years after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the moon, some people insist it never happened and was all a big hoax by the U.S. government.
The suspicions arose even as the lunar landing was taking place in 1969, said Roger Launius, NASA's former chief historian. Soon, conspiracy theories that said it was an elaborate, Hollywood-style production created on a soundstage on Earth started to take root.
The notion is treated mostly as a punchline, as in a new commercial for Red Bull. But public opinion polls over the years have consistently shown roughly 5% to 6% of Americans believe the moon landing was faked, Launius said.
Aldrin once ran into one of those people in 2002 and punched him in the face after the man called the former astronaut a liar.
Here's a look at some of the most common claims and how they're explained away: 






CLAIM: The American flag in photos from the moon looks as if it's flapping in the wind. That would be impossible, since there's no air on the moon.
THE FACTS: Rather than let the flag droop, NASA decided to use a right-angled rod to keep it spread out, according to Launius. Armstrong and Aldrin accidentally bent the rod a little bit, making it look as if the flag was in motion. They were also worried that the flagpole was going to fall down after they had twisted it into the ground, so they quickly snapped the photos, capturing the flag while it was still moving, Launius said.
___
CLAIM: No stars show up in the background of any photographs because NASA knew astronomers would be able to use them to determine whether the pictures were taken on Earth or the moon.
THE FACTS: The shutter speeds on the astronauts' cameras were too fast to capture the faint light of the stars, astronomer Emily Drabek-Maunder at the Royal Observatory Greenwich in London said. NASA used high shutter speeds to make sure the pictures weren't overexposed from the bright light on the moon.
___
CLAIM: When the lunar module descended onto the moon's surface, it didn't scatter any dust and didn't leave a crater from the rocket blast that slowed its descent.
THE FACTS: In landing on the moon, the astronauts were traveling horizontally for a while, so the thrusters weren't pointed down and wouldn't have kicked up any dust, Drabek-Maunder said. But when the module finally did touch down, ""you can see dust actually being thrown up."" 






As for the lack of a crater, Launius said the astronauts didn't need to use a large blast to slow themselves down, because the moon's gravity is roughly one-sixth that of Earth's. ""It was more of a gentle landing,"" he said.
___
CLAIM: The angle and colors of the shadows in photographs from the moon are inconsistent, suggesting artificial lights were used to illuminate a set.
THE FACTS: The many bumps, craters and hills on the moon, along with the various light sources that illuminate it -- light directly from the sun, light reflected off the moon's surface and light reflected off the Earth -- cause what look like distortions and inconsistencies, Launius and Drabek-Maunder said. Also, the astronauts' cameras had wide-angle lenses that can distort objects.
___
CLAIM: Armstrong and the lunar module are seen reflected in Aldrin's helmet visor in an iconic photo of Aldrin in his spacesuit on the moon. But there's no sign that either astronaut is holding a camera. So who took the picture?
THE FACTS: The astronauts' cameras were mounted on their chests, Drabek-Maunder said. As a result, Armstrong did not have to hold his up to his eye. His hands, in fact, appear to be near his chest in that picture.

53.FakeNewsWhySnopesPre,"
Arriving as a new employee to Snopes in fall 2018, I discovered that this storied fact-checking operation, a household name in the fight against ""fake news,"" preferred to avoid using the term ""fake news.""
""Ok ...,"" I Slacked.
Nevermind the phrase raining down in conversations with friends and waterfalling over comment threads I monitor for Snopes. I wasn't ready to argue with my new bosses. I opened my umbrella and carried on.
According to one archive, President Donald Trump has tweeted the phrase ""fake news"" more than 450 times as president. Often in his tweets ""fake news"" stands proxy as a vague noun that lets him impugn whole industries of journalists at once, including you know who:

The more I wrote around the phrase ""fake news"" in my work writing social media posts and other Snopes copy, the more bizarre it felt. Like we'd stripped ""giant"" from David's style guide.
Speaking of Davids, founder of Snopes.com David Mikkelson pointed out to me that Snopes was using the term ""fake news"" long before Trump was employing it as a near-daily insult. In fact, many people were. As Merriam-Webster observed, ""'Fake news' is a new term. That means it's only about 125 years old.""
For a while around 2013-14, Snopes and others in the fact-checking industry understood and used ""fake news"" narrowly, to refer specifically to (the relatively small) set of websites that intentionally pumped out fabricated stories for laughs, for lucrative clicks, or for other reasons we may never understand. Whatever the motive, the content produced by these sites was often so absurd you (almost) did not need a fact-checker to point out it was fake.
For example:

Things change.
More than one recent Snopes investigation has uncovered clandestine and coordinated efforts by entities pretending to be something they are not online. And their actions appear to be politically motivated.
Meanwhile, the prevalence of ""deepfake"" videos is raising alarm about how even savvy users can be fooled by deceptively altered and edited content.
And of course, ""fake news"" is a feared threat to elections worldwide. One of the first things despots do in democratic societies, Snopes managing editor Doreen Marchionni sometimes reminds us, is to demonize journalists. Take down the journalists -- in print, in broadcast, online or on social platforms -- and so goes democracy.
In a recent interview, journalist Maria Ressa criticized social media platforms for failing to accept their responsibility in the spread of misinformation and disinformation. ""They broke democracy,"" she told CBS News.
Not surprisingly, as the implications of ""fake news"" have shifted, so too has the definition.
When ""fake news"" was introduced to Dictionary.com in 2017, Time magazine was already noting there was more than to the phrase than was captured in its recorded definition.
Craig Silverman, a media editor for BuzzFeed News who has been credited with helping to mainstream the phrase, wrote that he came to cringe at it:
The end of ""fake news"" as I knew it came on Jan. 11, 2017, when Donald Trump -- master of branding -- redefined the term to mean, effectively, news reports he didn't like. The previous day CNN and BuzzFeed News had reported on the existence of the Steele dossier. [...]
Political movements around the world recognized the genius of Trump's tactic and adopted it. Now, ""fake news"" is a global phrase uttered by leaders and citizens alike. It's emblazoned on T-shirts, used in memes, abused as a hashtag. It's never been more ubiquitous and, as a result, more confused and manipulated.
He wasn't alone. Washington Post columnist Margaret Sullivan had already called for the term's retirement altogether, arguing its meaning had been lost:
""Instead, call a lie a lie,"" Sullivan advised. ""Call a hoax a hoax. Call a conspiracy theory by its rightful name. After all, 'fake news' is an imprecise expression to begin with.""
This was also my boss' contention with the phrase. ""Information doesn't necessarily have to be fake or false to qualify as 'fake news,'"" Mikkelson explained.
One ""fake news"" creator in Macedonia confirmed as much to the BBC:
""That thing happened, the people were there, the place was there. So it was never fake stories"" in the sense of fabricating every detail. ""It was propaganda and brainwashing in the way of telling the story.""
The contradiction doesn't seem to trip up readers. According to a 2017 Gallup/Knight Foundation Survey on Trust, Media and Democracy:
Americans themselves have not reached a clear consensus on what constitutes ""fake news."" Most adults agree that false information portrayed as if it were true always (48%) or sometimes (46%) deserves the label ""fake news."" Strikingly, most Americans also say that accurate stories portraying politicians in a negative light always (28%) or sometimes (51%) constitutes ""fake news.""
""Fake news"" evolved to signify not a measure of a claim's veracity but, rather, its potential for challenging one's preferred perception.
As The Atlantic noted in an analysis of a 2019 Pew Research Center study, there can be a consequence to perceiving information as threatening:
While nearly six in 10 Democrats have dropped an outlet over perceived fake news, a full 70 percent of Republicans have. A much larger portion of Republicans has also reduced their overall consumption of news. The less politically aware are also 20 percent more likely to have reduced their overall consumption of news than the more politically aware -- meaning that people who were already acquiring the least information are now acquiring even less.
At Snopes we strive to contribute information to public discourse, not subtract from it. If ""fake news"" can no longer reliably signal whether a piece of reporting is trustworthy, and instead behaves like a rhetorical middle finger, it doesn't have a place in our work.
So what to say instead?
AP Stylebook suggests alternatives such as ""false reports,"" which misses the point for our purposes. Again, information doesn't have to be ""false"" to be considered ""fake news"" in common parlance. A ""big person"" does not a ""giant"" make.
Mikkelson favored ""junk news"" as a more useful label. And he pointed me to an interesting rationale explained by Centre for Internet and Society researcher Tommaso Venturini:
So, if ""fake news"" is not about false information, what is it about? ... spread, rather than fakeness, is the birthmark of these contents that should be called ""viral news"" or possibly ""junk news"" for, just as junk food, they are consumed because they are addictive, not because they are appreciated.
This is not to argue engaging with misinformation is not tantamount to indulging in the occasional cheeseburger. Rather, it seems logical that a media diet that favors junk would have consequences, just as a real diet that has an excess of sodium and fat. Venturini again:
'Junk news' is dangerous not because it is false, but because it saturates public debate, leaving little space to other discussions, reducing the richness of public debate and preventing more important stories from being heard.
In other words, the threat of junk news lies in the absence of what it's displacing: actual information.
In a 2017 report on ""Information Disorder,"" researchers Claire Wardle and Hossein Derakhshan recommended several steps for tackling the problems of all manner of misinformation. Number one on that list?
1. Definitions. Think more critically about the language we use so we can effectively capture the complexity of the phenomenon
Put another way: ""Media literacy works, and it just might save humanity,"" according to Columbia Journalism Review.
Back to that Pew study:
""Of the 52% of Americans who say they have shared made-up news themselves, a vast majority of them said they didn't know it was made up when they did so.""
This highlights the challenge: We cannot fight what we cannot see. We cannot change what we cannot name.
By using the phrase ""junk news,"" we aim to emphasize the distinction between misinformation and content created purposely to deceive.
More precision, not less, is key if we want to understand better and be better understood.
Most useful of all, by using ""junk news"" we can clearly signal such content's best possible destination:
The trash.

244.ConspiracyWeary,"
A bizarre theory claiming that singer Avril Lavigne died and was replaced with a doppelganger has been circulating online since the idea was first offered by the Portuguese-language blog ""Avril Esta Morta"" (Avril Is Dead) back in 2012; in October 2015, a reader asked:
There is a rumor that Avril Lavigne is actually dead and that her doppelganger ""took over"" as her. Is this real? Or is it just a whole bunch of bs?
Since then, a ridiculous amount of ""evidence"" has surfaced to prove that the person currently posing as Avril Lavigne is an impostor. Song lyrics were analyzed, photographs were examined, and soon the conspiracy theory was propagated by web sites such as God Like Productions:

Too bad I can't post the link here because it certainly will get me banned LOL, but it's a VERY VERY well built website, probably made by a die-hard fan of Avril Lavigne, and the author of the article scrutinized several details of her career to came to a conclusion that the Canadian singer hanged herself before the second album and was replaced by a doppelganger, who left several clues about the death of the original Avril, in the lyrics and covers of the next albums. Some lyrics are pretty blatant by the way! I quoted the verses that highlight a possible suicide! According to the article's author, she killed herself after she went home and found out that her parents abandoned her.
Nobody's Home:
Open your eyes and look outside, find the reasons why. You've been rejected, and now you can't find what you left behind. Be strong, be strong now. Too many, too many problems. Don't know where she belongs, where she belongs. She wants to go home, but nobody's home. It's where she lies, broken inside. With no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes. Broken inside.
Her feelings she hides. Her dreams she can't find. She's losing her mind. She's fallen behind. She can't find her place. She's losing her faith. She's fallen from grace. She's all over the place. Yeah,oh
The elaborate theory was even broken down by popular publications such as Vice and Gawker, and soon fans of the singer started questioning whether or not she was alive. 






But in July 2015 the ""Avril Esta Morta"" blog admitted that the theory was completely fabricated as an object lesson in internet misinformation and rumor:
Avril is not dead...
The blog was a way to show how conspiracy theories can seem real. Many people believe everything they see on the internet, but is it right? There are many conspiracy theories about many things, but some seem no more convincing than theories that are not real. Avril Lavigne never died and was replaced by a lookalike, I created this theory to see if people would believe it, and thousands of people believed it was a fact. An important point is that I created this theory with no intention of lying; all I did is offer arguments that anyone could search for information about and prove. I used information to form a real theory that is in fact unreal. I apologize to people who believed that she was dead and feel disappointed about this revelation, but this was an exercise to teach to become more skeptical cand not believe everything you see! It was never my intention to offend anyone, just to create a theory and test people's reaction to it. You will observe I left some clues that it was all just a theory and not a fact, for example when in the beginning of the blog I referenced the ""supposed death of the singer Avril Lavigne."" In other words, it is just a guess! If you want to believe that she is dead, that is your choice, but I say that it was all just a theory created by me.
Unfortunately, the damage was already done. The above-quoted update was only ""liked"" 500 times within six months of its original publication. The Vice article, on the other hand, has been shared tens of thousands of times.
As such, a number of Avril Lavigne's fans still believe that she passed away and was replaced with a doppelganger:

I watched a creepy conspiracy video last night about how Avril Lavigne is actually dead and I'm still freaked out
-- jacey (@jacerain) November 5, 2015

I kinda believe avril lavigne is really dead -- santa baby (@shaghennessy) November 5, 2015


So apparently Avril Lavigne is dead, and has been replaced by a look a like named Malissa.
-- white cheddar (@Duda1Hayley) November 5, 2015 







After reading theories about how Avril Lavigne is dead, I'm convinced this is true -- princess (@Arianaspoon) November 4, 2015

In summation, there is no truth behind the theory that Avril Lavigne killed herself and was replaced by an actress. This theory was created with the sole purpose of proving how easy it is to spread misinformation on the Internet.
Well, mission accomplished.

362.Therearepaidproteste,"
Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones claimed ""paid protesters"" fueled the conflict with law enforcement after a recent vigil and demonstration for Stephon Clark, a 22-year-old shot and killed by police.
Responding to a call of a man breaking car windows, Sacramento police fired 20 times at Clark, who they said was advancing toward them with a gun in his grandparents' backyard on March 18, 2018. Later, it was revealed, he was carrying a cellphone.
Ever since, demonstrators have filled Sacramento's streets, as well as city council meetings, calling for police reform.
Jones made his statement about paid protesters during a news conference in early April. The sheriff showed video from March 31, 2018 of a deputy's SUV striking a demonstrator who walked in front of the vehicle.
A crowd of marchers had blocked two sheriff's SUVs after a vigil for Clark in south Sacramento. Deputies had asked the crowd to step away before the collision took place.
Jones described some of the people in the streets as ""professional protesters and professional instigators.""
""We do know because of our intelligence, because of the same folks that we see at protests completely out of the area and because of our history with some of these folks that there are paid protesters,"" the sheriff added. ""And paid people to instigate just as there are paid folks to monitor protests and video camera for their own purposes.""
When asked for evidence by a reporter at the conference, Jones said: ""We do have evidence of it and we've seen it previously,"" though he was not specific.
For this fact-check, we decided to zero in on Jones' claim that some ""paid protesters"" took part in the Stephon Clark demonstrations, either on the evening of the vigil or before.
Protest organizers have described the sheriff's statement as baseless and inflammatory, saying the demonstrators are volunteers and not for-hire protesters.

Response from sheriff's department
In a phone interview, Sgt. Shaun Hampton, a spokesman for the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department, declined to provide evidence supporting the sheriff's statement.
""I don't think we're going to disclose that at this time,"" Hampton said, adding that he did not foresee the department disclosing evidence in the future.
He also declined to say why Jones made the claim without providing any supporting material.
""It's based on our information,"" he said.
Jones appears to be the only top law enforcement official to make such a claim.
A spokesman for the Sacramento Police Department told us he did ""not have any specific information"" about paid protesters.
Asked about paid protesters on Capital Public Radio's Insight program, Sacramento Police Chief Daniel Hahn said he believes Jones was referring only to the March 31, 2018 demonstration outside city limits. 
""I don't know. We weren't there,"" Hahn said of any payments.
A spokeswoman for the California Department of Highway Patrol, which has also provided law enforcement at the demonstrations, said in an email the ""CHP does not have evidence of paid protesters.""

Most of the Sacramento demonstrations after Clark's death have been well organized and peaceful. There have been isolated cases of vandalism, including breaking car windows, the disruption of a city council meeting, a brief closure of a freeway and the closure of a basketball arena.
Jamier Sale is an organizer with the ANSWER Coalition's Sacramento chapter. It helped lead the March 31, 2018 vigil and protest.
ANSWER stands for Act Now to Stop War and End Racism. The national organization helped organize the U.S. antiwar movement opposing the 2003 invasion of Iraq, according to its website.
Sale challenged Jones to release evidence to support his claim.
""We're an all volunteer-based organization and we're run all from donations,"" Sale told PolitiFact California. ""And we print our signs and we put them on sticks with our own hands. Nobody pays us to do anything. We're organized and we're effective. And if we come off as professional, that's because we take what we do very seriously.""
Claire White is an attorney representing Wanda Cleveland, the woman struck by the deputy's SUV. She is also vice president of the National Lawyers Guild Foundation, a volunteer organization which monitors police activity at protests, including at the recent Sacramento events.
""This allegation that these people are paid, or that they're outside agitators, has no basis in reality,"" White told Capital Public Radio. ""The longer that Sheriff Scott Jones tries to sell that snake oil to the public, the more it's going to tarnish his own credibility.""
Tanya Faison is with the Sacramento chapter of Black Lives Matter, which has also organized recent protests.
""We are not paid,"" Faison said. ""We work for free. Some of us are mothers, students and interns. We do this on the side.""
She said Jones' comments are ""irresponsible"" and could give his supporters in the community ""permission to be more aggressive"" with protesters.
David Meyer is a sociology and political science professor at UC Irvine who wrote the book The Politics of Protest: Social Movements in America. He said politicians frequently make claims about paid protesters, without evidence, to marginalize people who represent opposing points of view. He said Democrats made those allegations about Tea Party activists in 2009 and Republicans made them about liberal activists who packed congressional town hall meetings in 2017.
Meyer said it's not realistic to think groups paid for protesters in the Stephon Clark case.
He added that the sheriff's ""assertion without evidence is unconscionable.""
Other claims without proof
This isn't the first time PolitiFact has examined a provocative claim from a politician who didn't support it with evidence.
President Trump has repeatedly stated there was ""serious voter fraud"" in California in the 2016 election -- without providing any proof. PolitiFact California investigated that allegation and rated it Pants On Fire.
In February 2017, PolitiFact National probed a claim by GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas that political activists were ""being paid"" to protest members of Congress. It concluded ""It's possible some protesters somewhere may be paid, but there's zero evidence of a wide-ranging conspiracy to bring in paid activists to disrupt meetings.""
It rated that claim False.
Our ruling 
Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones claimed ""paid protesters"" inflamed recent demonstrations over the death of Stephon Clark.
Protest organizers say Sacramento's streets have been filled with volunteers, not for-hire demonstrators. They've called the sheriff's claim baseless.
Jones appears to be the only top law enforcement official to make this assertion and has said he has evidence to back it up. His spokesman, however, declined to provide any information to support it and said it's unlikely they ever will.
When we evaluate statements at PolitiFact, the burden of proof is on the person making the claim.
We'll assess any information that might be released in the future.
In the meantime, we rate Jones' claim False.

FALSE - The statement is not accurate.

022.DoesanIncreaseinArct,"
On 1 October 2017, pseudoscientific alternative health website NaturalNews.com, which is geared primarily toward supplement enthusiasts with a discerning taste for deep state conspiracy theories, posted an article (""Don't Look Now, But Arctic Sea Ice Mass Has Grown Almost 40% Since 2012"") that attempts to cast doubt on the scientific veracity of global warming by first presenting the following grotesque caricature of a straw man argument:

One of the most popular pieces of ""evidence"" that climate alarmists just love to bring up to prove the global warming narrative is the ""all the ice is melting in the Arctic and the polar bears are dying"" line. We've all seen the documentaries where a polar bear is desperately clinging to a tiny piece of ice and you just know he's going to die soon.

They article then presents two observations that make the generally factual point that there has been relatively more sea ice in the Arctic and glacial ice on Greenland in 2017 than there have been at specific times in the recent past:

The latest figures from the National Snow and Ice Data Center, located at the University of Colorado, show that sea ice extent has increased by 40 percent since 2012. [...]
[The Danish Polar Portal reports that]: If we rank the annual surface mass balance since 1981 from low to high, the lowest on record was 2011-2012 (38 Gt) and this year is the 5th highest out of the 37 year record.

To be clear, the primary data scientists use to document global warming are records of Earth's temperature over time, not doomed polar bear imagery. Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist for the independent, nongovernmental Berkeley Earth research group told us in an e-mail that, in this area, pretty much ""all groups who provide estimates"" of global temperature unequivocally point to nearly uninterrupted temperature rises since the 1970s, as shown in this comparison of various estimates produced by the climate and energy policy website Carbon Brief: 







""People interested in global warming are best-served looking at actual global temperatures,"" Hausfather said.
While this temperature trend is uncontroversial and clear, the climate system as a whole is a complex beast with numerous entangled parts. The basic approach to writing a blog post that ""debunks"" the concept of global warming is to highlight without explanation various parts of that system at a single point in time. NaturalNews.com is no exception to that basic strategy here.
Arctic Sea Ice
Natural News cites a climate change denial blog called ClimateDepot.com as evidence of the claim that sea ice has grown 40 percent since 2012. In reality, the claim made by this website was more specific and less useful. In a post dated 18 September 2017, Climate Depot stated:

Arctic sea ice extent is up 40% from this date five years ago.

""Sea ice extent"" is one of many different metrics used to characterize the presence of sea ice, and is generally defined as ""the area of ocean [based on pixels in satellite imagery] where at least 15 percent of the surface is frozen"". On the day of 17 September 2017, sea ice extent was indeed higher than it was on 17 September 2012:
 






This does not mean, however, that sea ice has grown almost 40 percent since 2012, nor does it mean that the overall trend in arctic sea ice is toward growth -- it hasn't and it isn't. The issue here is that sea ice extent is quite variable from year to year, and thus looking at two discrete points is a fairly useless exercise without the full context. ""We don't expect it to monotonically decrease every year,"" Hausfather told us. 
This chart (using data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center) shows September sea ice extent compared against the same average used in the maps cited by Climate Depot, showing both this aforementioned variability but also an overall trend of reduced ice extent. Note that the year 2012 was no random year to select for comparison; it is actually the record lowest year in terms of Arctic sea ice extent -- making anything compared to it necessarily higher:

The overall trend of declining sea ice is even clearer when you look at a different measure: sea ice volume (presented by the Polar Science Center, below). Not only do such records show a clear negative trend, they also show just how anomalous 2012 was as a data point:

In reality, 2017 was the eighth lowest year on record for Arctic sea ice extent since satellite measurements began in 1978. But in no world but the pseudo-scientific fringe internet would the concept of global warming rely on every single year breaking the previous year's record for sea ice minimum.
Tom Karl, the former director of NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information, told us that 2017's sea ice extent was still much lower than the 1980-2010 average (by two standard deviations), and that, despite claims to the contrary, ""one can't look at a trend over 5 years and say much about the impact of global warming as other factors are also important on these short time scales.""
Glacial Ice on Greenland 






The NaturalNews.com approach for glacial ice on Greenland was similarly lacking scale and context. The main source for these arguments was a completely legitimate end-of-year report put out by the Danish Polar Portal, a website run by the Danish Meteorological Institute. In that report, the organization makes this factual statement:

Heavy snow and rain in winter with a relatively short and intermittent summer melt season have left the Greenland ice sheet with more ice than has been usual over the last twenty years -- in fact we have to go back to the 1980s and 90s to see a year similar to this one in terms of snow fall and ice melt.

This statement, and the figures presented by NaturalNews.com, are referring to a metric known as Surface Mass Balance (SMB), which Polar Portal describes:

Each year glaciers gain ice from snow and freezing rain and lose ice by melt that runs off. Adding these together gives the surface mass budget (SMB) in Greenland, the ice sheet typically gains mass from around September to May and loses more mass than it gains in the ablation [melting] season of June, July and August.

Importantly, however, this measurement only presents half the picture in terms of how much mass is being lost from year to year from Greenland's glaciers. That's because it does not include the rather significant portion of ice that breaks -- or calves -- off into the ocean to melt elsewhere. On average this accounts for about 500 Gt [gigatons] of further ice loss. This, as stated in the Polar Portal post, nearly matches the estimated gain in SMB reported by Natural News, effectively canceling it out.
In a post on Carbon Brief, analysts with the Danish Meteorological Society put this year's measurement in context:

While the Greenland ice sheet has seen a neutral, or small positive, change in ice for this year, it should be noted that Greenland has lost approximately 3,600bn tonnes of ice since 2002.

Like the record of Arctic sea ice earlier, when put in the context of the entire trend of Greenland's ice mass over time (presented by Polar Portal below), 2017's measurement does nothing to change larger and completely unambiguous trends of overall melting:
 

Further, in the case of Greenland's ice sheet, there is not much of a mystery surrounding the lackluster amount of melting this year; a massive storm -- the remnants of Hurricane Nicole -- parked itself atop the continent, dumping a large amount of snow on the ice-covered continent:

Heavy rain and snow in October in especially eastern Greenland gave record totals of precipitation in the main east coast town of Tasiilaq as the remnants of former hurricane Nicole passed by and, much as with Harvey in Houston this year, got lodged over eastern Greenland for some days. However, after Nicole's extreme precipitation, the rest of the winter was actually pretty average in terms of the amount of snow that fell.

Because neither the higher-than-2012 arctic sea ice from 17 September 2017 nor the neutral amount of ice loss in Greenland in 2017 do anything to disrupt the overall trends of decreasing ice, and because climatological science does not require (nor does it expect) ice or temperature records to be broken every single year, we rank the claim that these observations are reasons to doubt the tenets of climate change as false.

Shocker! A conspiracy-minded website is appalled that former President Barack Obama dismissed a conspiracy theory.
The day after Obama spoke in Anaheim, Calif., to gin up support for Democrats in the midterm elections, the website American Viral Patriot posted an article headlined ""Obama Disrespects Heroes Of Benghazi, Calls It 'Wild Conspiracy Theory,' Survivor Cleans His Clock.""
The Sept. 9 item said that in that speech, Obama ""referred to the carnage that took place in Benghazi as a conspiracy theory.""
No, he didn't. (And by the way, Obama gave the speech in question a day earlier, in Illinois. He made no mention of Benghazi or conspiracies in Anaheim.)
Obama was decrying what he saw had happened to the Republican Party, how, as he put it, the GOP had become home to ""the politics of division, of resentment and paranoia.""
Obama gave his list of measures a Republican Congress had championed.

55.Michiganlawmakersinv,"
Michigan House Republicans, discussing a bill to ban ""vaccine passports,"" gave a legislative platform to Naomi Wolf, an avowed conspiracy theorist who has shared wildly false claims, ranging from Bill Gates modifying mosquitos so they can inject people with vaccines to vaccinations causing irregular menstruation. 
Wolf came to the House Oversight Committee May 6 to voice support for the ban on vaccine passports, a form of documentation that states or businesses could theoretically use to check people for proof of vaccination.
Republican lawmakers have introduced a series of bills that would ban vaccine passports, and included similar language in several budget measures. 
At no point has Gov. Gretchen Whitmer or the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services ever said they planned to require vaccinations. However, the University of Michigan and other colleges plan to require vaccinations for students who choose to live on campus next year. 
""The state has been very clear that they're not currently exploring a vaccine passport concept,"" said Bobby Leddy, a Whitmer spokesman. 
Lynn Sutfin, a health department spokeswoman, decried the hearing and urged residents to go to trusted medical sources for vaccine information.
""At a time when the governor has set benchmarks for getting out of the pandemic, it is confusing why the legislature would spend time discussing a topic that neither (the health department) or the governor have considered, and relying on individuals with no medical background or expertise to provide testimony,"" Sutfin said.
Wolf was one of a series of speakers who at times voiced false and misleading statements about vaccines; several likened them to measures enacted during the Holocaust. That drew a rebuke from Democratic Rep. Julie Brixie. 
""I would be remiss if I didn't state for the record that the comparisons of the COVID vaccine to systemic racism, segregation and the Holocaust are appalling and abhorrent,"" she said at the end of the roughly 90-minute hearing. 
The committee discussed a bill from Republican Rep. Sue Allor. The measure would ban the government from requiring vaccines or developing passports to document vaccination. Allor said she will not get the COVID-19 vaccine. 
""Although the conversation at this point in time is specific to a COVID-19 vaccine passport, we must ask ourselves the question: 'If this is allowed, what might the next step be?'"" Allor said during the hearing. 
""Would an individual with a history of having received counseling be prevented from a great job opportunity? Would a female be denied a job opportunity because medical records indicate she has children, and the potential employer believes she has too many children to do the job well? Although you could say these questions are hypothetical ... the fact is, if these hypothetical questions did become realities, it would then be too late.""
But as Brixie noted, the broad definition of ""vaccine passport"" in the bill could prevent medical providers from sharing vaccination information with state health officials. Democratic Rep. David LaGrand also said it's generally a bad idea for the Legislature to ban something that isn't in use or created. 
""There's infinite numbers of things that we could ban preemptively,"" LaGrand said, adding: ""I think our job, frankly, is to take action and set policy on things that are actively under consideration."" 
Allor acknowledged she has not heard that Whitmer, the state health department or federal officials support implementing vaccine mandates. She is also working to change the bill; she appeared to have a different version of the bill than lawmakers on the committee, prompting confusion and debates over discrepancies in language between the two versions. 
Committee Chairman Steven Johnson, a Republican, said the discussion Thursday was important. 
""The intention is very clear: We want to make sure the government is not creating two tiers of citizens based on personal medical decisions,"" he said. 
Johnson did not immediately respond to questions about why Wolf was invited to speak or whether the committee Republicans agreed with any of her views. Gideon D'Assandro, a spokesman for House Speaker Jason Wentwork, did not directly answer questions about Wolf's views. He said it's up to committee leaders to decide how to use their time.
Wolf was one of 11 people who spoke in favor of the bill Thursday. She has repeatedly shared false and misleading information about COVID-19 -- and many other topics. 
Examples of ideas espoused or promoted by Wolf in the past through social media or as reported by several media outlets include: 

That masks do not stop the spread of COVID-19.
That COVID-19 vaccines cause anything from death to irregular menstruation in women who are around vaccinated women.
That the Moderna vaccine could be used to implant microchips into the body.
That Bill Gates created genetically modified mosquitos that could inject people with the vaccine.
That during the Ebola crisis, the U.S. sent forces to Africa not to help, but so the troops would return home with the disease and justify a military takeover of the country. 

While testifying, Wolf aired theories that vaccine-related apps on cellphones are tracking people, listening in on conversations about how they view vaccinations and potentially using that information. 
Lawmakers did not vote on Allor's measure Thursday, but Johnson said it is his intention to vote on the bill next week.

For more than a year, we've been experiencing two pandemics -- COVID-19, the disease ravaging the world, and the infodemic of rumors, hoaxes, and malicious disinformation surrounding it.
Snopes has been at the center of the latter. Desperate for information about a terrifying, deadly plague, readers grabbed any information they could and asked us to investigate. And we did.
One year on, we're ready to share what we've learned about the infodemic -- the year misinformation swallowed the world.
 






 

A Turning Point in Online Misinformation
By David Mikkelson
As Americans took in the shock and horror of the terrorist attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, some of them took to the internet (then still a new phenomenon to many people) to express one of the most common emotions people feel in such moments: a desire to exert some feeling of control over a world seemingly gone mad.
In the wake of the attacks, users forwarded viral emails proclaiming that Nostradamus had prophesied the attack (it was predictable!), warnings of future attacks (we can head them off!), exhortations to boycotts companies in which Osama bin Laden owned an interest (defund the terrorists!), and conspiracy theories positing that everyone from Israel to President George W. Bush was actually behind the attacks (we know who *really* did it!). All of these rumors provided readers with some sense of control in the chaotic aftermath of 9/11 ... and all of them were 100% false.
The attacks were a turning point in the history of Snopes.com. Online fact-checking wasn't yet a thing, and the traditional news media hadn't begun paying much attention to the internet as a phenomenon unto itself -- leaving us virtually alone as the one outfit dedicated to cataloging and investigating the myriad of rumors swirling around cyberspace about the devastating event. Millions of readers in the U.S. and elsewhere began turning to us for reassurance and enlightenment at a time when it was difficult to know what to believe or do.
We saw a similar cycle of (mis)information overload play out as the COVID-19 pandemic developed in early 2020. Social media users shared messages and memes holding that the coronavirus disease was a hoax, conspiracy theories asserting it was deliberately created (by China, or Dr. Anthony Fauci, or Bill Gates), promotions of dubious and unproven cures, and claims that face masks were unhelpful in preventing spread of the disease or even harmful to wearers.
Human nature may not have changed much in the 20 years between 9/11 and COVID-19, but the online information landscape certainly did. In 2001, much errant information was spread by well-meaning but misinformed members of the public; by 2020, foreign actors seeking to disrupt other countries, profiteers, and political partisans were all part of the mix of those who had vested interests in promoting COVID-related disinformation. However, although in 2001 few online resources (outside of Snopes.com) existed to combat this onslaught of ""fake news,"" by two decades later many more entities had sprung up to help wage the battle.

How to Inoculate Yourself Against Misinformation
By Dan Evon
While the Snopes team will always be here to help you sort fact from fiction, it's always helpful to have a few tips to sort out some obvious misinformation for yourself. Here are a few tips to sort out rumors:

Don't mistake anecdotes for evidence. Anti-Vax arguments often hinge on anecdotes. While these stories may be true, they often represent outliers to the scientific data.
Be wary of emotional posts. Viral misinformation is often designed to get an emotional reaction from the viewer. Be on alert for emotional language in posts.
Reading headlines is not enough. Headlines often give readers an intriguing (but not necessarily honest) glimpse of a news item. Make sure to read the article to see if the headline matches with the reporting.
Trace your info back to its source. Where is this information coming from? If you see something you're unsure of, see if you can trace this information back to a reputable source.
Keep yourself up to date. Advice for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic has changed a few times over the last year as health experts learn more about the virus. Keep an eye on the CDC or WHO for the latest, most up-to-date info.

221.ThewomankilledduringtheJan6USCapitolassaultwasshotbyaSecretServiceagentnotCapitolPolice,"
The unprecedented Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol spawned a predictable array of online rhetoric about who was involved and what exactly happened.
Many details were still emerging a day later, but we know the mob fueled by and in support of President Donald Trump forced its way into the House and Senate chambers after a series of f violent clashes with law enforcement. When the dust cleared, more than 50 police officers were injured and four people were dead -- three from what authorities termed medical emergencies, and one from a gunshot wound.
Wisconsin state Rep. Jonathan Brostoff, D-Milwaukee, focused on the woman shot and killed in a Jan. 7 tweet, describing the matter this way:
""The Trump Terrorist who was put down during the violent mob assault wasn't (as they claimed) shot by the Capitol Police, they were (physically) on her side. Instead it was a secret service agent who discharged his firearm while doing his duty to protect democracy.""
The Secret Service claim caught our eye.
Let's take a closer look.
What we know
After an incendiary speech from Trump the morning of Jan. 6, thousands of his supporters marched to the Capitol. It was a gathering long planned and promoted online by Trump backers and conspiracy theorists.
In what experts have called a catastrophic failure of security, the group not only moved through barriers around the building but broke through windows to enter the building itself. 
The deadly showdown occurred in a hallway where Capitol Police had used furniture to barricade a glass door. Witness video (warning, graphic content) shows a plain-clothes officer standing with a gun drawn. He fires once as a woman later identified as Ashli Babbitt climbs through a broken window adjoining the door.
Babbitt falls to the floor, where she is immediately treated by uniformed officers on her side of the barricade. A Jan. 7 news release by Capitol Police said she was taken to a nearby hospital where she died of her injuries.

By Grace Abels * June 21, 2022







U.S. Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., told Good Morning America he was in the hallway behind the officer who shot and killed Babbitt.
""When they broke the glass in the back, the (police) lieutenant that was there, him and I already had multiple conversations prior to this, and he didn't have a choice at that time,"" Mullin said in a Jan. 7 interview. ""The mob was going to come through the door, there was a lot of members and staff that were in danger at the time. And when he (drew) his weapon, that's a decision that's very hard for anyone to make and, once you draw your weapon like that, you have to defend yourself with deadly force.""
Babbitt, a 35-year-old San Diego woman, was a 14-year Air Force veteran who served four tours as a high-level security official, KUSI-TV in San Diego reported. Her husband told the station she was an avid Trump supporter.
Babbitt also backed the violent QAnon conspiracy theory, with 21 tweets referencing that slogan since February 2020, according to the Daily Beast. The site reported that Babbitt posted Jan. 5 that the United States would soon see ""The Storm,"" a day of reckoning the conspiracy theorists believed was coming for deep-state pedophiles, sex traffickers and Trump opponents.
Brostoff's claim
Brostoff said his claim was based on watching witness video that showed a non-uniformed officer shooting Babbitt. 
But he's wrong.
A statement by Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund said Babbitt was shot by a sworn Capitol Police officer who has been placed on administrative leave in line with agency policy. That's in line with the description from Mullin, who witnessed the shooting and talked to the officer involved.
In light of that information, Brostoff said he ""may well have been misinformed"" and deleted his tweet.
Our ruling
Brostoff claimed a Secret Service agent was responsible for the lone shooting death in the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol.
But he now acknowledges that was incorrect. Law enforcement confirmed later that day a Capitol Police officer pulled the trigger.

61.StudyproveschildrensheartsdestroyedbyCOVIDvaccine,"
Texas cardiologist Dr. Peter McCullough recently claimed that a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study shows COVID-19 vaccines are causing myocarditis in children. But he took the data out of context, making misleading assertions about vaccine safety that ignore the greater health risks COVID-19 infection poses to children.
The claims came in a video interview with InfoWars, a website known to publish false stories and conspiracy theories. The video was titled ""Study Proves Children's Hearts Destroyed By COVID Vaccine.""
""The data were not good at all,"" McCullough said. ""They ended up with 100 serious safety reports, 15% of which had an elevation in troponin. That means there's heart injury occurring in children below age 12. We previously didn't think this was possible. When we looked at myocarditis before COVID-19 vaccination you almost never saw it before puberty.""
This interview was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). Several of McCullough's claims about COVID-19, including myocarditis in teens and children, have been previously disproven as false or misleading. We reached out to McCullough but did not hear back before publication.
Myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, is rare in children. A June 2021 statement signed by multiple professional medical associations and federal health agencies states that myocarditis is an extremely rare side effect after vaccination, and those who do get myocarditis often recover quickly.
The FDA expanded emergency use authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to children ages 5-11 on Oct. 29, 2021. The CDC study McCullough references is a Dec. 31, 2021, report reviewing data from the agency's two vaccine safety surveillance programs, VAERS and v-safe. The 100 serious safety reports McCullough mentions is out of a total of 4,249 adverse events, meaning 97.6% of those safety reports weren't considered serious. While the 15 cases of elevated troponin levels make up 15% of serious adverse events, they amount to only 0.35% of total adverse events.

According to International Olympic Committee data, ""an average of 29 athletes under the age of 35 suffered sudden death per year from 1966 to 2004. From March 2021 to March 2022, 769 athletes have died or suffered cardiac arrest.""












By Samantha Putterman * June 23, 2022







To put these numbers further into scale, those 4,249 reported adverse events are out of 8.7 million vaccine doses administered over that time period; fewer than one-thousandth of 1% of children who received the vaccine reported elevated troponin, a protein released into the blood during heart damage. Of the 11 children verified to have myocarditis, seven had recovered and the other four were recovering at the time of the report's publication.
The systemic reactions that McCullough also remarked on in his interview were all mild to moderately severe, the majority of which were fatigue and headache. These are common side effects of a vaccine, indicating that the immune system is responding and building protection against the virus. Of the approximately 4,500 to 4,600 children who reported having any health impact through the v-safe app, barely 1% required medical care.
A far greater risk factor for myocarditis, studies show, is COVID-19 itself. A September 2021 CDC report found that patients of all ages with COVID-19 have a 16 times greater risk of myocarditis compared with patients without COVID-19. And while COVID-19 is usually mild among children, some develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome, or MIS-C, where many different parts of the body, including the heart, become inflamed.
""While kids are less likely to develop severe illness from COVID-19, they can get COVID-19, they can transmit COVID-19 and they can die from COVID-19,"" said cardiologist Dr. Matthew Elias in an interview with the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. ""Even if they initially have no symptoms with infection, they can still develop MIS-C, which many families haven't ever heard of.""
""Children are much more likely to develop heart issues after COVID-19 infection than after the vaccine,"" said Elias. ""When children develop myocarditis after COVID-19 infection, it's typically much more severe than when it occurs post-vaccine.""
The American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics both recommend COVID-19 vaccination for children over age five. Children are more likely to avoid heart complications from COVID-19 with vaccination than without.

181.ObamaPlansClintonInd,"
Almost from the moment Barack Obama was elected to the U.S. presidency in November 2008, conspiracy mongers began positing methods by which he would seek to remain in power once his term of office expired -- everything from fomenting a ""national emergency"" that would provide him with an excuse for cancelling elections to declaring martial law and suspending the Constitution to (somehow single-handedly) altering the Constitution to remove its presidential two-term limit.
In August 2016 Joseph Farah, editor of the notoriously unreliable WND web site, tossed a new scenario into the third-term conspiracy mix: President Obama's ordering a strategically delayed indictment of putative President-Elect Hillary Clinton over charges related to her using position as Secretary of State to solicit donations to the Clinton Foundation.  This, according to Farah, would create a ""constitutional crisis"" that would disqualify Clinton from holding office and enable President Obama to remain in the White House past the expiration of his term of office:

[T]here is another possibility, even more sinister, perhaps. Suppose -- just suppose now -- that Obama is hedging his bets. What if he is actually using this FBI and this Injustice Department to do a real investigation intended to maintain his position as president? I have previously speculated, and that's all it is I admit openly, pure informed speculation, that Obama has not completely abandoned the idea of remaining president past Jan. 20, 2017. 
So what if -- and it's a big ""if"" -- Obama is holding something back? Suppose he has actually authorized a probe of what she did as secretary of state to benefit herself and the Clinton Foundation.
Is it possible he might use the findings -- and, believe me, they are not hard to find -- to indict her between Election Day and Jan. 17, while he is still president?
If she is indicted on serious charges, she will not be permitted to take the oath of office. Neither will Tim Kaine be permitted to assume the office of the president because he will not yet be vice president.
The whole thing will create a constitutional crisis. The next in line, House Speaker Paul Ryan, will not be allowed to assume the presidency, either, because there is a sitting president.
If this admittedly unlikely and far-fetched scenario occurs, it will demonstrate that Obama has been planning it for quite some time. That's why I'm telling you about the remote possibility now.

Like much of what Farah and WND publish, this scenario ignores how things actually work in favor of promulgating a sensational and politically slanted conspiracy theory.
No provision of the U.S. Constitution states that a person who is under indictment is ineligible to run for, be elected to, or hold the office of President of the United States.  In fact, no provision of that document disqualifies from the presidency a person who is currently on trial, has been convicted, or is serving prison time.  (Indeed, in 1920 Socialist Party candidate Eugene V. Debs campaigned for the presidency from the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, where he had been incarcerated for violating the Espionage Act, and captured 3.41% of the popular vote.) 






The U.S. Constitution does allow for the impeachment and removal from office of civil officers --  including the President and Vice President -- but only for crimes committed while in office, not  for acts undertaken prior to assuming office.
Moreover, President Obama's term of office expires at noon on 20 January 2017, period.  It makes no difference whether or not a living, eligible, duly elected successor is on hand to immediately assume the presidency -- there is no constitutional provision for Barack Obama to remain in office past that date.
Farah's narrative doesn't even make logical sense (not even for a far-fetched conspiratorial political imagining), positing that it a ""constitutional crisis"" would be triggered by the following series of events:

If [Clinton] is indicted on serious charges, she will not be permitted to take the oath of office. Neither will Tim Kaine be permitted to assume the office of the president because he will not yet be vice president.
The whole thing will create a constitutional crisis. The next in line, House Speaker Paul Ryan, will not be allowed to assume the presidency, either, because there is a sitting president.

As long as there is a ""sitting president,"" all of this is irrelevant. The status of the President-elect isn't an issue until the term of the current President expires, so it's nonsensical to say that the Vice President or the House Speaker ""would not be allowed to assume the presidency"" beforehand -- until President Obama's term is finished, there's no vacancy to be filled.  In any case, the Vice President-elect is sworn in before the President-elect, so if for some reason the President-elect could not take the oath of office, the United States would still have an eligible, sitting Vice President available to take over presidential duties when the incumbent's term ended.
Okay, so if the scenario presented here (i.e., Hillary Clinton won the presidential election but was indicted before assuming office) wouldn't necessarily create a ""constitutional crisis,"" what would happen if it played out in real life?
Hillary Clinton could simply take office regardless, but it's quite likely that a pending criminal indictment (with the possibility of trial and conviction) would effectively cripple her ability to govern, so she would choose to step down before assuming the presidency.  Exactly what would happen next is unclear because the situation would be an unprecedented one not specifically addressed by the Constitution, but existing law and previous experience provide some guidelines about what to expect.
The closest the Constitution comes to addressing this circumstance is the 20th Amendment, which provides that ""If, at the time fixed for the beginning of the term of the President, the President elect shall have died, the Vice President elect shall become President. If a President shall not have been chosen before the time fixed for the beginning of his term, or if the President elect shall have failed to qualify, then the Vice President elect shall act as President until a President shall have qualified.""  Additionally, the 25th Amendment states that ""In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President.""  
Technically none of these provisions would apply, because Hillary Clinton would not have been removed from the presidency by death, nor could she resign an office she had never assumed in the first place.  Clinton could conceivably take the oath of office and then immediately resign, thereby elevating Vice President Tim Kaine to the presidency, but that course of action might be eschewed as one that would create an unseemly political spectacle.
It's also possible that Hillary Clinton could simply decline to be sworn in, whereupon Vice President Kaine would become acting President under the 20th Amendment provision that the President elect ""failed to qualify.""  This course is less certain, as the Constitution is unclear on whether a President-elect must take the oath of office to become President or only to execute the powers of that office.  Additionally, it would likely raise constitutional issues of whether Tim Kaine would remain an acting President for the duration of Clinton's ordinary term, whether he would become President in his own right, or whether the former would hold true only until a new President was selected.  
Quite possibly the issue would end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, but it's hard to imagine that the outcome would result in anything other than the presumed default of the Vice President's taking over (either as acting President or actual President) for the duration of the term -- especially since prolonged opposition would effectively leave the U.S. leaderless in the meanwhile.  
Whatever may happen, the one scenario that is not a possibility is the one proffered by Farah, that Barack Obama remains in office past 20 January 2017.  Barack Obama's term of office expires on that date without qualification, and having already served two terms as President, he would be ineligible for election to that office again under the terms of the 22nd Amendment.
